AB  - BackgroundWhen measuring the treatment effect in tinnitus with multi-item outcome instruments, it is crucial for both clinical and research purposes to take into consideration clinical importance of the outcome scores. The aim of the present study is to determine minimal important change (MIC) in tinnitus which is clinically meaningful to patients with otosclerosis.MethodsThe study population was 95 patients with otosclerosis, suffering from tinnitus. They completed the Tinnitus Functional Index before stapedotomy and 3months after the surgery. The minimal important change was estimated with the Clinical Global Impression Scale as the external criterion (anchor). The mean change method and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method were used to determine minimal important change in tinnitus sensation.ResultsThe improvement in tinnitus after stapedotomy was reported by 69.4% of the patients with otosclerosis. Minimal important change in tinnitus was estimated as reduction of 8.8 points in the Tinnitus Functional Index.ConclusionsThe anchor-based approach using an external criterion (anchor) allows to determine change in tinnitus sensation which is meaningful to patients after stapedotomy. The value of 8.8 points in Tinnitus Functional Index could be used as benchmark of stapedotomy effectiveness in otosclerosis patients suffering from tinnitus. Hearing difficulties comorbid with tinnitus could affect the perception of tinnitus change.

AB  - Objective To relate poststapedectomy change in tinnitus loudness to change in tinnitus severity.
   Study Design Prospective, within-subjects.
   Setting A single otology and neurotology subspecialty referral practice.
   Subjects and Methods Forty-nine subjects undergoing stapedectomy completed the study between January 2012 and October 2013. Tinnitus instruments, audiometric data, and demographic information were collected prior to and 1 and 6 months after surgery. Tinnitus loudness was assessed using an 11-point (0 = none; 5 = conversation level; 10 = jet engine) visual analog scale, and severity was measured using the validated Tinnitus Functional Index. The relationship between change in tinnitus loudness and change in tinnitus severity was evaluated using linear regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.
   Results A linear regression model of change in tinnitus loudness averaged for both ears on a visual analog scale (VAS(avg)) versus change in Tinnitus Functional Index score (TFI) showed a strong correlation (TFI = 9.35 xVAS(avg); R = 0.64; P < .001). An ROC analysis identified VAS(avg) between 1.5 and 2.0 as the optimal threshold for predicting a clinically significant change in tinnitus severity (TFI 13), with sensitivity and specificity of approximately 0.62 and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.64.
   Conclusion For poststapedectomy patients, a VAS loudness change by 1.5 to 2.0 points averaged for both ears in bilateral tinnitus or similar to 3 points in unilateral tinnitus has a PPV similar to 0.64 for a clinically significant change in tinnitus severity.

AB  - PurposeTo assess the prevalence and severity of tinnitus among a group of Polish patients with otosclerosis who qualified for stapes surgery. A secondary objective was to gauge the relationship between tinnitus severity and hearing thresholds.MethodsBased on the eligibility criteria, 460 adults with otosclerosis (236 women, 134 men) were included in the study. The Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) was used to assess tinnitus severity. Hearing thresholds for air and bone conduction were established using clinical pure-tone audiometry in a soundproof cabin.ResultsBased on the medical interview, tinnitus was the first symptom of otosclerosis in 35% of the participants and 65% of all patients with otosclerosis experienced clinically significant, chronic tinnitus before stapes surgery. For 59% of patients, tinnitus was a significant or severe problem. The degree of hearing loss seemed to be marginally related to the severity of tinnitus reported by the patient.ConclusionsTinnitus is a common complaint among patients with otosclerosis, being a significant or severe problem for more than half of them. For this reason, it is worth considering in the future the implementation of standardized questionnaires for the assessment of tinnitus severity as a routine procedure in the diagnostic process of patients with otosclerosis, as well as in the postoperative period, which will be the next stage of our study.

AB  - Objective: To assess change in tinnitus severity after stapedectomy using the validated Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) at 1 and 6 months in 2 cohorts of subjects with otosclerosis with different preoperative (TFIpre) distress levels.
   Study Design: Prospective within-subjects repeated measures.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty-six subjects completed the study between January 2012 and April 2013. Demographic information, preoperative and postoperative audiometric data at 1 month, and TFI scores measured preoperatively within 1 month of stapedectomy and postoperatively at 1 and 6 months were captured and analyzed.
   Results: Stapedectomy has its largest effect on tinnitus severity reduction within the first month of surgery. Cohort A (TFIpre > 15, n = 16) Delta TFI mean and median values were similar to 20 for the intervals preoperatively to 1 month and preoperatively to 6 months (p values < 0.01) and dropped to similar to 0 for the interval between 1 and 6 months postoperatively. Cohort B (TFIpre < 15, n = 10) Delta TFI mean and median values were similar to 0 for all time intervals (all pairwise comparison p values > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Stapedectomy in patients with otosclerosis with more than a small problem with tinnitus (TFIpre > 15) will reduce severity by at least 1 clinical category in similar to 85% of cases within 6 months of surgery. The majority of patients will experience stable tinnitus suppression within the first postoperative month. In patients with no tinnitus or less than a small problem with tinnitus (TFIpre < 15), stapedectomy carries a 10% risk of transient worsening of tinnitus at 1 month, which resolves by the sixth postoperative month.

AB  - Objective: To determine whether stapedotomy was effective in reducing tinnitus severity. In addition, the relationship between reduction in tinnitus and improvement in hearing after stapedotomy was analyzed.
   Study Design: Prospective clinical study.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: A group of 168 otosclerosis patients diagnosed with chronic tinnitus.
   Intervention: Stapedotomy.
   Main Outcome Measures: The Tinnitus Functional Index questionnaire (TFI) was used to assess tinnitus severity before surgery, and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Pure-tone audiometry was conducted before surgery and 6 months postoperatively.
   Results: The TFI Total score before the operation was M = 34.5 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.6) points, and decreased 3 months after stapedotomy to M = 17.5 (SD = 1.7), a statistically significant change (T = -8.200; p < 0.001). A weak correlation was found between the pre- and postoperative difference of TFI Total score and air-conduction thresholds (r = 0.21; p = 0.013) as well as between the TFI Total score and the size of the air-bone gap (r = 0.21; p = 0.013). Preoperatively, 86 patients tinnitus was a not or small problem, and for 82 it was moderate to very big. After stapedotomy, 93 (55%) of patients experienced a significant reduction in tinnitus severity. Of the whole group, 62 patients (37%) reported complete disappearance of their tinnitus. No change in tinnitus severity was reported by 63 patients (38%), and an increase was observed by 12 patients (7%).
   Conclusion: Stapedotomy not only improves hearing but also reduces tinnitus severity. The current results extend knowledge of postoperative results in terms of tinnitus severity, and might benefit patients undergoing tinnitus counseling. It might also be useful to otolaryngologists when making decisions regarding qualification criteria.

AB  - Introduction: Otospongiosis is temporal bone osteodystrophy, characterized by disordered bone resorption and neoformation in genetically predisposed individuals. Clinically, otospongiosis is characterized by progressive conductive and/or mixed hearing loss and by tinnitus.
   Objective: A review of the last two decades of publications that report the degree of tinnitus improvement with stapes surgery.
   Methods: 125 articles published in the last 20 years mentioning the relationship between otosclerosis and tinnitus. Literature has always shown that the hearing improvement after stapes surgery was the main result sought and found. However, recent articles has reinforced the need for surgery for the tinnitus improvement. The ideal time to assess tinnitus through different scales is in the sixth month post-operative. The estimated average hearing improvement is 93% and tinnitus is 85.52%.
   Results: Summaries of 12 articles were reviewed which fulfilled the search criteria of the survey, and 8 studies were included in the study according the selection criteria. This studies investigating the degree of tinnitus improvement with stapes surgery, using different scales as: tinnitus functional index, visual analog scale, tinnitus functional index and visual analog scale, visual analog scale and "questionnaire asking about tinnitus'', Newman's method and Tinnitus Score Advocated by the Japan Audiological Society. The total of the samples of the evaluated articles was of 254 participants.
   Conclusion: We conclude that stapes surgery is effective for the treatment of tinnitus (average improvement is 85.52%), and hearing loss (average improvement is 93%). When deciding about the surgical indication in patients with otosclerosis, the presence and level tinnitus should be considered as well as the level of hearing.

AB  - Background: Stapes surgery is a common method of treatment of otosclerosis, and its effectiveness is reported based on audiometric hearing thresholds. Audiometric tests do not gauge the impact of tinnitus severity and auditory function on quality of life (QOL) after stapes surgery. Objective: To measure self-assessed QOL in otosclerosis patients after stapedotomy in terms of three major factors: change in audiometric hearing threshold, subjective hearing benefit, and tinnitus severity. Method: This prospective clinical study included 191 patients who underwent stapedotomy between April and October 2017 due to otosclerosis. All patients were tested by pure tone audiometry and filled in a questionnaire before surgery and 6 months afterwards. Subjective hearing was assessed with the Abbreviated Profile for Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB); tinnitus severity was established using the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), and the QOL was measured by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Results: Statistical analysis showed that the average GBI total score (mean = 33.7; SD = 23.7) was statistically significantly higher than zero (t = 19.7; p < 0.001). Based on a regression model, all the three variables studied - audiometric hearing thresholds change, APHAB change, and TFI change - had a significant effect on QOL after stapedotomy. Interestingly, the highest beta value (b = 0.040; p < 0.001) was for TFI change, implying that TFI change had the greatest effect on QOL. Conclusion: Although the improvement of QOL after stapes surgery undoubtedly depended on improvement in both audiometric and self-reported hearing, the reduction of tinnitus severity had the greatest impact on increase in QOL.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In addition to progressive hearing loss, subjective tinnitus is one of the primary symptoms of the otosclerosis development. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and severity of preoperative tinnitus among a group of consecutive adult patients with otosclerosis, using standardized research tools.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: The study included 157 cases of clinical otosclerosis (106 women, 51 men). All patients were tested using pure-tone audiometry. The preoperative prevalence and severity of tinnitus were tested using three validated questionnaires: The Tinnitus and Hearing Survey (THS-POL), Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI-POL), and Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI-Pl).
   RESULTS: Preliminary results showed that 107 of 157 patients with otosclerosis (68.2%) had preoperative tinnitus. Of them, 51 (47.7%) had unilateral tinnitus (in the ear that qualified for stapes surgery), and 56 (52.3%) had bilateral tinnitus. The THS results showed that for 23.4% patients, tinnitus was a problem equal to or greater than hearing loss. The average result of the TFI-Pl questionnaire was 31.6 points, and for THI-POL, it was 38.6 points, indicating that preoperative tinnitus was moderately severe. The statistical analysis did not reveal a correlation between the tinnitus severity and audiometric results (p>0.05). The severity of tinnitus did not differ significantly between men and women (p>0.05), although the TFI-Pl and THI-POL questionnaires indicated that the tinnitus severity generally increased with age in women, while it decreased in men.
   CONCLUSION: This is a scientific study conducted to evaluate the prevalence and severity of preoperative tinnitus in Polish patients with otosclerosis, using three validated questionnaires.

AB  - Titanium implants in middle ear surgery were introduced in the late 90s and are now frequently used in middle ear surgery. However, long-term studies of patient outcome are few and have only been published in subgroups of patients. We report the long-term effect of titanium middle ear implants for ossicular reconstruction in chronic ear disease investigated in a Norwegian tertiary otological referral centre. Retrospective chart reviews were performed for procedures involving 76 titanium implants between 2000 and 2007. All patients who underwent surgery using the Kurz Vario titanium implant were included in the study. Audiological parameters using four frequencies, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz, according to AAO-HNS guidelines, was assessed pre and postoperatively. Otosurgical procedures, complications, revisions, and extrusion rates were analyzed. The study had no dropouts. The partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) was used in 44 procedures and the total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) in 32 procedures, respectively. Mean follow-up was 5.2 years (62 months). The ossiculoplasties were performed as staging procedures or in combination with other chronic ear surgery. The same surgeon performed all the procedures. A postoperative air-bone gap of a parts per thousand currency sign20 dB was obtained in 74 % of the patients, 82 % for the Bell (PORP) prosthesis, and 63 % for the Arial (TORP) prosthesis. The extrusion rate was 5 %. We conclude that titanium ossicular implants give stable and excellent long-term hearing results.

AB  - Background: Type 3 tympanoplasty is the surgery of choice for middle ear reconstruction in cases where an integral stapes suprastructure and mobile footplate are present.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to obtain functional results after endoscopic type 3 tympanoplasty in chronic otitis media.
   Materials and methods: Prospective study including 24 patients who underwent endoscopic type 3 tympanoplasty, using PORP for ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR) and cartilage graft for tympanic membrane reconstruction. Audiograms were made preoperatively, and 6 months after surgery.
   Results: Dry, closed, self-cleaning ears were obtained in 91.7% of the cases. Mean preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 30.4 dB, mean postoperative ABG was 16.7 dB, dB gain of 13.6 dB. ABG closure rate to 20 dB or less of 79.2%, and to 10 dB or less of 29.2%.
   Conclusion and significance: Endoscopic tympanoplasty and OCR is a valid option for surgeons who are comfortable with the use of endoscopes for middle ear surgery as it allows improved visualization of the prosthesis and graft placement during middle ear reconstruction.

AB  - Objective Evaluating postural function in patients with otosclerosis by assessing otoneurological function and balance-related quality of life before and 6 weeks after surgical treatment. Correlations between and clinical features were investigated. Methods Thirty-three patients affected by otosclerosis underwent otoneurological examination, video Head Impulse Test (vHIT), and static posturography before and after stapedotomy. Quality of life and dizziness-related handicap were screened by means of validated questionnaires. Correlation analysis was performed in order to discover possible relations with audiological pre- and postoperative parameters. Results A significant improvement in posturographic parameters was found. Correlation analysis yielded a negative correlation between preoperative bone conduction auditory threshold and both vHIT scores and postural performance improvement, evaluated by spectral analysis. Moreover, a positive correlation was also found between improvements in posturographic scores and quality-of-life questionnaires. Conclusion The study results demonstrated an improvement in postural function and self-reported measures in a cohort of patients with otosclerosis 6 weeks after stapedotomy. The inverse correlation with preoperative auditory levels may reflect lesser chance for balance restoration in cases with worse sensorineural function. Possible implications for daily activities and overall quality of life were suggested by improved self-report questionnaire results. Level of Evidence 4 Laryngoscope, 2019

AB  - Objective: To evaluate population-based data on incidence and efficiency of middle ear surgery.
   Study Design: Retrospective review.
   Setting: All otolaryngology departments in one federal state in Germany.
   Patients: All 1,037 middle ear surgeries performed in Thuringia in 2005.
   Interventions: Middle ear surgery. Main Outcome Measure: Analysis of preoperative and postoperative audiometric results, preoperative diagnostics, and postoperative complications. Univariate statistical tests were used to analyze predictors for air-bone gap (ABG) improvement, complications, and need for resurgery. Population data were used to calculate incidences of middle ear diseases admitted for surgery and annual rates of middle ear surgeries.
   Results: ABG improved after surgery for chronic otitis media without and with cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, trauma cases, or complication after acute otitis media/externa (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p = 0.005; p = 0.004; respectively). Middle ear surgery significantly improved bone conduction in cases of otosclerosis (p = 0.008), sudden deafness (p = 0.006), and acute otitis media/externa with complication (p = 0.004). There was a trend of more complication in patients older than 60 years (p = 0.055). Surgery was indicated for chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma in 17.4/100,000 persons, for cholesteatoma in 15.0/100,000, for otosclerosis in 5.7/100,000, for sudden deafness with suspicion of perilymph fistula in 1.5/100,000, and for trauma with affection of the lateral cranial base and hearing loss or otitis media with complication in 1.3/100,000 habitants, respectively. A cochlear implant was indicated in 1.0/100,000 habitants.
   Conclusion: This population based analysis is showing that middle ear surgery is performed country-wide with good results and low risk on important scale in daily routine by ear surgeons.

KW  - postoperative nausea and vomiting
AB  - Background
   This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of palonosetron, the 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist, in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after middle ear surgery.
   Patients and methods
   Sixty-two ASA I and II patients who had undergone middle ear surgery under general anesthesia were included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study and were enrolled into two groups: palonosetron group (P) and placebo control group (C). Patients were administered 0.075 mg of palonosetron or isotonic saline, respectively. The incidence of PONV and requirement of rescue antiemetics were assessed. The severity of nausea was evaluated according to the visual analogue scale. Patients who had not experienced any attack of vomiting or received rescue drug were considered to have a complete response.
   Results
   The incidence of PONV was significantly lower in group P than that in the control group C during (0-4 h) P-value less than 0.001 and (4-24 h) 0.05 periods, and the incidence of complete response was 83.7% in group P and 6.5% in group C (P<0.001).
   Conclusion
   Palonosetron could provide effective prophylactic antiemetic control to prevent PONV after middle ear surgery under general anesthesia.

AB  - To pilot a substantive randomized control trial comparing post-operative external ear canal pack with no ear pack after middle ear surgery, 32 adults undergoing primary posterior bony canal wall preserving middle ear surgery were randomized to have either a bismuth iodoform paraffin paste pack or no ear pack post-operatively. Outcome measures included clinician- and patient-recorded visual analogue scale scores for ear signs and symptoms at 3 weeks and 3 months and audiometric findings at 3 months post-operatively. There was no statistically significant inter-group difference in 3-week clinician and patient cumulative scores for ear signs and symptoms. There was also no significant difference in graft take rate, appearance of ear canals and audiometric results in either group at 3 months. No difference in ear symptoms, clinician findings or hearing was demonstrated between patients with a post-operative pack compared to those without a pack following middle ear surgery in this pilot study.

AB  - Objective/Hypothesis: Taste disturbances are often seen in patients after middle ear surgery due to the stress received by an unprotected chorda tympani. It has also been reported that loss in tactile sensitivity may accompany this issue. The current study was designed to measure electrical, chemical, and tactile sensitives of several senses involved in oral processing, smell, taste and touch, over time.
   Study Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Methods: For three time points, one before middle ear surgery and two after operation (about 5 and 23 days), sensitivity thresholds were obtained using electrogustometry (electrical taste), taste strips (chemical taste), Sniffin' Sticks (smell) and Von Frey Hairs (point-pressure tactile sensitivity).
   Results: The results show a decline in both chemical and electrical taste responses. Additionally, the electrical taste response showed more sensitivity to deviations and no sign of recovery unlike the chemical taste response. Mechanosensory function of the anterior tongue and olfactory function was not strongly affected by middle ear surgery.
   Conclusion: Taste responses, but not mechanosensory or olfaction function, are altered after middle ear surgery. Due to the effects that taste loss has on quality of life, gustometry is recommended for this group of patients.

AB  - Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) may limit communication, which is closely associated with cognitive decline of the elderly and negatively affects their quality of life. In ARHL patients who suffer chronic otitis media (COM), hearing impairment may worsen and negatively affect the cognition and quality of life. It is currently unknown whether restoration of the conductive hearing in the mixed hearing loss through middle ear surgeries can improve both the cognitive function and quality of life of the ARHL patients. Therefore, in the present study, the ARHL patients were followed up for 6 months after middle ear surgeries for COM, and both the cognitive functions and quality of life of the patients were assessed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Glasgow Benefit Inventory. It was found that both the cognitive functions and quality of life were improved 6 months after middle ear surgeries. In conclusion, hearing recovery after middle ear surgeries could improve cognitive functions and quality of life of ARHL patients with COM, and surgical intervention is, hence, recommended for COM.

AB  - To limit functional surgical failure and reduce the rate of revision surgery in case of surgical ossicular chain reconstruction, a piezoelectric device was developed for assessment of ossicular chain vibrations during the middle ear surgery. The device resembled a pen and consisted of a reusable main body and a disposable sensitive head including piezoelectric polymer sensor. Almost all of components of the device were made of polymer for light weight and for acoustic impedance matching to the middle ear system. Several frequencies can be analyzed simultaneously and several measures can be taken by time. The results showed that the device can record normal and reconstructed ossicular chain vibration in response to an acoustic stimulation, with similar results to those achieved by laser Doppler vibrometer. This light, handheld and low-cost device allows fast, easy and safe assessments of normal ossicular chain mobility and ossicular chain reconstruction efficiency. Primary pre-clinical trial showed very promising performance of the device that could be used to qualitatively control ossiculoplasty during real-time surgical procedure. Clinical assessments will be done to further evaluate the real-life performance of the device.

AB  - Background. The ongoing improvement of imaging quality nowadays focuses increasingly more on immediate quality evaluation of surgical measures.
   Methods. Rotational tomography (RT) has been experimentally proven to be an alternative imaging technique to computed tomography (CT) in terms of quality and postoperative localization of middle ear implants in temporal bones. Based on these results imaging parameters were determined in the form of a surgical check list in order to systematically check individual but important surgical reconstructive steps.
   Results. The positive benefit of RT concerning immediate and significant postoperative quality control was confirmed by a patient study. The surgical check list was successfully implemented under clinical framework requirements. Among these standardized parameters the determined angulation of inserted middle ear implants was given outstanding significance due to the predictive value concerning functional outcome.
   Conclusion. The RT procedure has been proven to be a reliable imaging tool for postoperative quality control following reconstructive middle ear surgery.

AB  - This review article aims to scrutinize the studies conducted to determine a relationship between preoperative Middle Ear Risk Index (MERI) factors and postoperative graft acceptance and audiological gain in patients undergoing tympanoplasty procedures in middle ear surgeries. Critical analysis is done on numerous research and types of studies that were done in this area during the past years. The clinical and technical aspects connected to disease and its care have a variety of effects on the morphological and functional outcome of tympanoplasty. A better comprehension of these characteristics aids in better disease prognostication, surgical planning, and patient counseling. At the end of this review, we can conclude that the MERI score is inversely proportional to the post-operative graft acceptance and audiological gain. The accumulated MERI is hence a good prognostic factor for the hearing outcome of surgery.

AB  - Background: The management of patients with tinnitus who receive middle ear surgery has not been established. Aims: The aim of this study is (1) how many patients who receive middle ear surgery have tinnitus and (2) how educational counselling and middle ear surgery is effective with consistent tinnitus. Subjects and methods: Twenty four cases out of 90 cases accounted for 26.7% of the middle ear diseases scheduled for surgery in the past two years. Of the 42 patients with hearing loss in the second year, 14 had consistent and intermittent tinnitus. Among them we have 6 patients complaining consistent tinnitus and we examined the change in the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) for patients with tinnitus before and after surgery. Results: Ten out of 13 cases (about 76.9%) reported that postoperative tinnitus improved. THI score in two cases showed worse.

AB  - Objective First, to survey our national otolaryngology colleagues on their postoperative care habits (hospitalization vs day surgery) after elective middle ear surgery. Second, to evaluate the necessity of hospitalization and safety of day surgery after these procedures.
   Methods A national survey regarding postoperative habits after elective middle ear surgery was launched. Then, the cases of all patients having undergone these surgical procedures at our center between 2010 and 2016 were reviewed. They were divided into 2 groups: hospitalization and day surgery. Postoperative events during hospitalization and rate of consultation/readmission for day surgery were recorded.
   Results Heterogeneity in postoperative habits for most elective otologic surgery exists among otolaryngologists. For tympanoplasty, however, day surgery was uniformly favored. At our institution, 88.6% of hospitalization patients had no complications during their stay. Complications noted for others were nausea (7.2%), bleeding (3.1%), hematoma (0.5%), and sensorineural hearing loss (0.5%). In the day surgery group, 3.0% consulted within 48 hours following their procedure, and the readmission rate was 1.3%. Nausea was the only cause for readmission, and stapes surgery accounted for 100% of readmissions.
   Discussion Most elective middle ear surgery can be safely performed as day care. Hospitalization does not provide care that could not have been provided at home in the majority of cases. Overnight hospital stay may be considered for stapes surgery.
   Implications for Practice Day surgery for elective middle ear surgery is sufficient for most cases. Transferring these cases to day care should lower costs to our health care system and increase bed availability.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical features of tinnitus in patients with chronic otitis media (COM) and to evaluate changes in tinnitus following middle ear surgery in relation to audiologic outcome. Medical records were reviewed for 117 patients with COM who underwent middle ear surgery between March 2009 and March 2010. Of them, 44 patients who pre-operatively reported tinnitus on a tinnitus questionnaire and 28 patients who completed a tinnitus questionnaire 8 weeks after surgery were evaluated to determine the clinical characteristics of tinnitus in patients with COM and any change in tinnitus following middle ear surgery, respectively. New tinnitus symptoms that developed after surgery were also evaluated in previously asymptomatic patients. The pre-operative incidence of tinnitus in patients with COM was 43% (50/117), with 87% of these patients displaying sensorineural tinnitus. After middle ear surgery, tinnitus handicap inventory scores were reduced in 82% of patients (23/28). Mean values of loudness, annoyance, effect on life, and awareness of tinnitus were also significantly reduced. One patient displayed newly developed tinnitus after surgery. Analysis of the relationship between improvement in tinnitus and audiologic outcome demonstrated that the group of patients whose tinnitus handicap inventory was reduced by more than 10 showed significantly greater improvements in mean air-conduction thresholds than did patients in the other group. In conclusion, following middle ear surgery, most patients experienced a reduction in tinnitus and restored hearing, with surgery perceived as an important contributory factor.

AB  - Objectives It is generally thought that the recovery of damaged chorda tympani nerve (CTN) function after middle ear surgery is different in pediatric patients from that in adult patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes and the progress of taste and somatosensory functions of the tongue after middle ear surgery in pediatric patients compared with those of adult patients. Study Design Prospective study. Methods Fifty-nine pediatric patients and 106 adult patients underwent middle ear surgery. Taste and somatosensory functions of the anterior tongue, the so-called CTN functions, were assessed using electrogustometry (EGM), a 2-point discriminator, an electrostimulator, and a questionnaire before and 2 weeks and 6 months after surgery. Results Two weeks after surgery, there was no significant difference in the incidence of dysgeusia and abnormal EGM thresholds between the patient groups. The incidence of tongue numbness was significantly lower in pediatric patients than in adult patients regardless of CTN manipulation. Although the lingual somatosensory thresholds of adult patients were significantly increased, those of pediatric patients were not increased. Six months after surgery, the incidences of dysgeusia and an abnormal EGM threshold were lower in pediatric patients than in adult patients. Tongue numbness disappeared, and the thresholds of lingual somatosensory tests returned to normal in most pediatric patients. Conclusion Not only taste function but also lingual somatosensory function was damaged after middle ear surgery even in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients complained of tongue numbness less frequently and showed earlier recovery than adult patients. Level of Evidence 2 Laryngoscope, 2019

AB  - Conclusion. The classification and hearing result reporting system of middle ear surgery provide a set of standard that otologic surgeons should comply with when they investigate the efficacy of procedures or report the post-operative results of middle ear surgery. Keeping up with this system will, in turn, facilitate and activate the evidence-based clinical research they would ask for. Objectives. The aims of the project were to establish the standardized classification nomenclature, to propose a guideline for the post-operative result reporting system, and to develop a database management program for middle ear surgery. Methods. Nine otologic surgeons from seven university hospitals in Korea carried out a field survey on the nationwide status of middle ear surgery and its records, and also collected the information regarding international classification and result reporting system from 2001 through 2004. To make a consensus, it also underwent a process of public audit and, a questionnaire investigation, as well. Results. The classification of surgery consisted of four kinds of procedures of mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, extraneous procedures, and concurrent procedures. Post-operative hearing result reporting consisted of basic requirement and reporting guidelines of hearing success. The basic requirements stated minimum follow up duration, and computing formulae of pure tone average ( PTA) and post-operative air bone gap (ABG). The reporting guidelines included criteria of hearing success (Post-operative ABG <= 20 dB, hearing gain >= 15 dB, or hearing level <= 30 dB), post-operative ABG grading of excellent, good, no or poor improvement, and comparisons of hearing improvement among the groups. Next, a database management program was developed using the standardized classification and result reporting system. Structure of database is composed of 144 fields including patient information/preoperative findings (45 fields), operative findings (36 fields), operative procedures (29 fields), and post-operative follow up (23 fields).

AB  - ObjectivesMiddle ear surgery increasingly employs endoscopes as an adjunct to or replacement for the operative microscope. We provide a systematic review of endoscope applications in middle ear surgery with an emphasis on outcomes, including the need for conversion to microscope, audiometric findings, length of follow-up, as well as disease-specific outcomes.
   Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL database.
   MethodsA literature review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations. Articles were categorized based on study design, indication, and use of an endoscope either as an adjunct to or as a replacement for a microscope. Qualitative and descriptive analyses of studies and outcomes data were performed.
   ResultsOne-hundred three articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the identified articles, 38 provided outcomes data. The majority of these studies were moderate quality, retrospective, case-series reports. The indications for use of the endoscope were broad, with the most common being resection of cholesteatoma. In cholesteatoma surgery, endoscope approaches routinely identified residual cholesteatoma in primary and second-look cases. Other outcomes, including robust audiometric data, operating room times, wound healing, and quality of life surveys were not well described.
   ConclusionsEndoscopes have consistently been used as an adjunct to the microscope to improve visualization of the tympanic cavity. Recent reports utilize the endoscope exclusively during surgical dissection; however, data comparing patient outcomes following the use of an endoscope to a microscope are lacking. Areas in need of additional research are highlighted.

AB  - BackgroundThe application of mastoid pressure dressings following mastoid and middle ear surgery is widely practised to reduce the risk of haematoma and seroma. There are a number of minor morbidities associated with use of the dressings, as well as a financial cost associated with an overnight stay in hospital or a return appointment for removal of the dressings. The benefit of having these dressings in situ overnight is questionable.
   MethodsA retrospective review of 133 patients who had their mastoid dressing removed 2h after their procedure was undertaken at our Hospital. The patient records were scanned for procedure-related morbidities, and perioperative data were analysed.
   ResultsNo haematomas or seromas occurred in any of the 133 patients studied. Minor morbidities associated with prolonged use of mastoid pressure dressings were avoided.
   ConclusionRemoval of mastoid pressure dressings 2h following ear surgery is safe and effective. Furthermore, a mastoid dressing should not be a factor in the decision as to whether to treat a patient as a day case or overnight admission.

AB  - Background and objective. An efficient training program in ear surgery needs suitable models to learn the specific preparation techniques. However, conventionally fixed or fresh frozen ears of human corpses do not meet all demands.Therefore we investigated the feasibility of ears fixed according to Thiel for surgical training in the temporal bone lab.
   Methods. Various surgical techniques on external and middle ears were evaluated on ears from cadavers fixed according to Thiel. Structure and consistency of the tissues were compared to vital conditions by means of a standardized questionnaire.
   Results. Structure and consistency of the tissues of the auditory canal,the tympanic cavity and the mastoid were comparable to vital conditions. Merely the cartilage of the auricle was considerable softened.This enabled a surgical preparation under conditions close to the intravital situation.
   Conclusions. Under the aspects of quality assurance and efficiency of continuous medical education in middle ear surgery, the Thiel fixation technique provides an excellent prerequisite.

AB  - Objective - It is generally said that taste function deteriorates naturally with age. Taste function after middle ear surgery in elderly patients has not been clarified.
   Material and Methods - The taste function of the chorda tympani nerve on the normal and diseased sides was examined before and after middle ear surgery using electrogustometry in 79 patients aged >60 years, and the findings were compared with those in 228 young and middle-aged patients.
   Results - The threshold of electrogustometry on the normal side increased significantly with increasing age (p < 0.0001). The rate of thresholds that were off the scale was highest in the >70 years age group. The preoperative threshold on the diseased side increased significantly with increasing age in patients with chronic otitis media (p = 0.0029) and cholesteatoma (p < 0.0001). In patients with chronic otitis media, the postoperative threshold of the >60 years age group tended to be higher than that of the < 60 years age group.
   Conclusions - These findings suggest that the taste function of the chorda tympani nerve deteriorated on the diseased side as much as on the normal side in elderly patients. Therefore, in most cases, we do not have to pay as much attention to the chorda tymapani nerve when performing surgery in elderly patients compared to young and middle-aged patients.

KW  - patient survey
AB  - The use of local anaesthesia for middle ear surgery is long established and has many advantages. However, it is only performed by a small number of UK otolaryngologists (20%). This lack of enthusiasm is due to concerns that patients may not tolerate the discomfort during the operation. Therefore, a survey was conducted on patients who had middle ear operations: stapedotomy, myringoplasty, ossiculoplasty and mastoidectomy. The intense sensation of noise during the operation (29.6% of patients) and anxiety (24%) were the most common discomforts, followed by dizziness (14.8%), backache (13.9%), claustrophobia (9.3%) and earache (1.9%). In spite of these discomforts, 89% of patients still preferred local anaesthesia to general anaesthesia for a similar procedure. The author suggests that good patient selection, preoperative explanation and the use of appropriate sedation are the important factors for local anaesthesia ear procedures to be acceptable to patients.

A prospective study was done for patients of chronic otitis media having ossicular discontinuity with necrosed lenticular process during surgery. It includes 115 patients of which 61 underwent ossicular reconstruction with titanium (PORP) and 54 with refashioned autologous incus during the period 2015-2023 (8 years). Pure tone Audiometry was done post-operatively at 1, 3, and 6 months. Air-Bone Gap (ABG) improvement was recorded as recommended by AAO-HNS (at 0.5,1,2,3 kHz) to assess hearing improvement and results were compared. The hearing improvement was analyzed by comparing the Air-Bone Gap and hearing loss before and after surgery. There was a significant hearing improvement in both groups. However, there was no statistically significant difference in hearing improvement between the two groups.As per AAO-HNS guidelines, a success outcome is defined as a of post-operative Air-Bone gap of less than20 dB. The success outcome in our study was found to be-Titanium prosthesis (PORP) - 73.77% (45/61patients) Autologous incus- 57.41% (31/54patients). Autologous incus is commonly used ossicular remnant for reconstruction with promising results in literature. In our study, titanium prosthesis also showed similar statistical significant improvement in hearing. Reconstruction using titanium prosthesis showed better results in-terms of percentile than autologous incus in AB gap closure.

AB  - Middle ear surgery (tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy) performed under general or local anesthesia is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Between 50% and 80% of patients who undergo these surgical procedures experience PONV. Numerous antiemetics have been studied for the prevention of PONV after middle ear surgery. Traditional antiemetics, including anticholinergics (e.g., scopolamine), phenothiazines (e.g., promethazine), butyrophenones (e.g., droperidol), and benzamide (e.g., metoclopramide), are used for the prevention of PONV during 0-24 h after anesthesia. The available nontraditional antiemetics that have been shown to be effective for the prophylaxis against PONV are propofol, dexamethasone, tandospirone, and midazolam. Antiserotinins (ondansetron, granisetron, and ramosetron) are highly effective in decreasing the incidence of PONV for 24 h postoperatively, compared with traditional antiemetics. Ramosetron is effective for the long-term (up to 48 h) prevention of PONV. None of the available antiemetics is entirely effective, perhaps because most of them act through the blockade on one type of receptor. There is a possibility that combined antiemetics with different sites of activity would be more effective than one drug alone for preventing PONV. Nonpharmacological technique is acustimulation at P6 (Nei-Kuwan) point.
   Clinicians should consider these clinical strategies as mentioned above for preventing PONV after middle ear surgery in adult patients.

AB  - Background: The incidence and the scale of recovery of the taste function after middle ear surgery is usually determined by the use of anamnestic data and electrogustometry.
   Methods: Taste tests (regional chemical taste test, electrogustometry and subjective evaluation) were performed preoperatively, 2 to 3 weeks and 6 to 9 months after middle ear surgery. These results were evaluated by taking the scale of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) manipulation into consideration. Three groups were chosen: group 1: no or small CTN manipulation, n = 54; group 2: strong CTN manipulation, n = 14; group 3: severed CTN, n = 50.
   Patients: In a prospective study 118 patients were examined after middle ear surgery in the ENT-Department of the University of Rostock between 2001 and 2002. 67 females and 57 males, age from 7 - 81 years, were included.
   Results: Complaints were observed in all three groups, mainly in groups 2 and 3. These included taste disorders, taste phenomenon and numbness of the tongue. Using regional chemical taste tests, the taste loss of group 3 could be proven for those patients with complaints in 64% and for those patients without complaints in 27 %. The electrogustometry is more sensitive than chemical taste test. All patients had pathological thresholds after chorda cutting (78 % no thresholds; 22 % elevated thresholds). 68 out of 118 patients (58%) had a second follow-up after 6 to 9 months after middle ear surgery. The complaints are declining in all groups. In groups 2 and 3 a recovery of taste function could be observed. Even if the number of patients with severed chorda, who suffer from taste disorders, diminishes, a recovery of the taste function could only be observed in 30%.
   Conclusions: The scale of chorda manipulation is important for the recovery of the taste function after middle ear surgery. The CTN should be preserved intraoperatively, especially when an operation of the contralateral ear is planned as well.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate taste disorders after middle ear surgery, their modifying factors especially chorda tympani nerve injury or underlying otologic disease. We investigated consequences of taste disorders on quality of life.Study DesignProspective cohort study.SettingMonocentric study in tertiary care center.MethodsA total of 214 patients who underwent middle ear surgery were included. Data regarding taste disorders were collected by questionnaires over a 1-year follow-up period.ResultsTaste disorders were reported in 42.7% at 10 days, in 23.3% at 4 months, and in 9.2% 1 year postoperatively. When the chorda tympani nerve was initially healthy, taste disorders were more frequent after its transection throughout the follow-up period. When it was involved in a cholesteatoma or inflammatory process, postoperative taste disorders were more frequent after nerve stretching. Postoperative discomfort in daily life was rated on the Likert scale at 3.5 out of 10. Dietary modifications were reported by 25.8% of patients, and mood alterations by 15% of patients.ConclusionTaste disorders are frequent after middle ear surgery although they mostly improve in the first months. When the CTN is healthy, cutting it leads to more taste disorders than stretching it, thus advocating its preservation to prevent these symptoms. However, in cases of pathological CTN, cutting this nerve, which is sometimes necessary to control the disease, is less likely to cause taste disorders than stretching it. These taste disorders are a source of discomfort and may present risks of dietary modifications and emotional impact.

AB  - Objective: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication after middle ear surgery. We have aimed to compare the administration of a subhypnotic dose of propofol with dexamethasone 4 mg or 8 mg and placebo in prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after middle ear surgery.
   Method: This clinical research was performed at Yuksek Ihtisas Hospital Kirikkale. The study included 105 adult patients scheduled for a middle ear operation. The patients were randomly assigned into three groups. The patients in Group I received propofol in a dose of 0.5 mg.kg(-1) plus 4 mg of dexamethasone while Group II was administered with propofol in a dose of 0.5 mg.kg(-1) plus 8 mg of dexamethasone, and Group III was given 0.9 % saline solution. Within the framework of the study we evaluated the number of patients suffering from nausea and vomiting at 0-4, 4-12, and 12-24 hours postoperatively, and the necessity to use additional antiemetics.
   Results: The comparison of data showed that at up to four hours, the incidence of vomiting was 28.6 % in Group I, 22.9 % in Group II, and 65.7 % in Group III. The incidence rates in Group I and Group II were significantly lower than that in Group III (p<0.05), while the rate of antiemetic drug usage was higher in Group III than in Group I and Group II (p<0.05). The Nausea Vomiting Scale scores were also significantly higher in Group III than in Group I and Group II (p<0.05). There were no significant differences between the values at 4-12 and 12-24 hours.
   Conclusion: The administration of a subhypnotic dose of propofol plus 4 mg of dexamethasone at the end of surgery was found to be at least as effective as propofol plus 8 mg of dexamethasone in preventing the PONV in the early postoperative period in adult patients undergoing middle ear surgery (Tab. 4, Ref. 34).

AB  - Background. The purpose of this work was to assess postoperative pain management after middle ear surgery.
   Materials and methods. In a prospective clinical study, 73 adults were evaluated on the first postoperative day after middle ear surgery using the questionnaire of the Germany-wide project QUIPS (quality improvement in postoperative pain management). The main outcome measures were patients' characteristics, pain parameters, outcome, and pain therapy process parameters.
   Results. Overall, pain on the first postoperative day was mild. Pain management consisted predominately of premedication with midazolam, remifentanil intraoperatively, metamizole in the recovery room and on the ward. Otherwise healthy patients suffered significantly more from pain than patients with reduced general condition in univariate and multivariate analyses. About half of the patients demanded pain relief on the ward. Despite immediate pain management with nonopioids and/or opioids, these patients had significantly more maximal pain and were less satisfied with overall pain therapy than patients not demanding pain therapy.
   Discussion. QUIPS is a simple tool to evaluate the quality of in-hospital postoperative pain management following ear surgery. Pain on the first postoperative day seems to be moderate but should be improved for patients demanding more analgetics despite baseline pain therapy on the ward.

AB  - Objective: Among other difficulties, achieving a stable position of a total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) is demanding because of a limited view on the TORP-footplate interface and individual angles between the footplate and tympanic membrane. The Kurz Omega Connector aims at a simplified insertion of the TORP. The performance of total ossicular reconstruction using the Omega Connector was evaluated.
   Study Design: Prospective cohort study and experimental measurements with a fresh human temporal bone.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: Seventeen consecutive patients receiving total ossicular reconstruction were included. Historical control group composed of 36 patients.
   Interventions: Total ossicular reconstruction using the Omega Connector.
   Main Outcome Measures: (a) Handling of the TORP and Omega Connector intraoperatively, (b) functional short-term results compared with a historical control group, (c) sound transmission properties with 3 different connective positions between the TORP and the Omega Connector.
   Results: Placing the Omega Connector on the footplate and coupling the Omega Connector to the TORP was straightforward in 65% of cases. A stable final position of the TORP was obtained in 88% of cases. Mean (SD) preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps were 36.00 (11.05) and 25.29 (12.25) dB and were almost identical with those in the historical control group (p = 0.9). In the experimental measurements, functional outcomes with "partial connection'' showed almost the same results as those with "full connection.''
   Conclusion: The Omega Connector provides easy handling of the TORP. The short-term functional results were comparable to those achieved previously without the Omega Connector. The temporal bone measurement supports tolerance in connective position between the TORP and the Omega Connector.

AB  - Background: The relationship between nasal functions and middle ear surgery is still under debate. Nasal obstruction is considered as a negative prognostic factor in middle ear surgery. This is based on the theory that it may cause Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) by leading to reduced ventilation of the middle ear, as found in several patients with nasal septal deviation, chronic rhinitis and nasal polyps.
   Objectives: To assess how the subjective feeling of nasal function, evaluated by a preoperative questionnaire, may be predictive of surgical outcome and/or risk of failure in middle ear surgery.
   Methods: We prospectively evaluated data of patients undergoing middle ear surgery for chronic otitis media with and without cholesteatoma. All patients completed the SNOT-22 and ETDQ-7 questionnaires. They underwent surgery for their pathology, as appropriate.
   Results: The SNOT-22 score was higher in patients with retraction pocket and in patients whose retraction pockets recurred after surgery (p < 0.05). Patients with higher score at SNOT-22 questionnaire, were more likely to show recurrence of atelectasis aftersurgery.
   Conclusions: The SNOT-22 questionnaire, administrered before surgical procedure, can help in the identification of patients who are at risk of failure in the post-operative period, as well as ETDQ-7.

AB  - Objective To reveal the factors affecting the incidence of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) transection during middle ear surgery. Study Design Retrospective case review. Setting Tertiary referral center. Patients We analyzed 232 ears (117 ears with cholesteatoma, 101 ears with chronic otitis media, and 14 ears with otosclerosis) that underwent tympanoplasty or stapes surgery during 2017-2020. Intervention Eighty-four ears underwent transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES), 103 ears underwent microscopic ear surgery (MES), and 45 ears underwent surgery using both endoscopy and microscopy (Dual). Main Outcome Measure To confirm CTN transection, intraoperative endoscopic/microscopic video images were evaluated. We used the same video images to determine the anatomical variation of the CTN course in the middle ear. Results In 18 ears (7.8%: 6/84 TEES ears [7.1%], 6/103 MES ears [5.8%], and 6/45 Dual ears [13.3%]), the CTN was cut during middle ear surgery. There was no significant difference in CTN transection among groups. In cholesteatoma patients, stapes involvement resulted in a significantly higher CTN transection incidence. CTN anatomical variants such as the "Attached Short type" and "Ultrashort type" showed a significantly higher CTN transection incidence. Conclusion Although endoscopic surgery did not reduce the incidence of CTN transection during middle ear surgery, pathological involvement of the stapes and CTN anatomical variants, such as the "Attached Short type" and "Ultrashort type," may increase this incidence. Preoperative evaluation of stapes involvement and anatomical location of the CTN course could help identify patients at greater risk for iatrogenic CTN transection. Level of Evidence 4.

AB  - Objective: The authors report the results of a survey of members of the American Otological Society (AOS) and the American Neurotology Society (ANS) regarding their use of prostheses currently available for ossiculoplasty and stapedectomy. These findings are compared with a similar study presented by one of the authors in 1989.
   Methods: Questionnaires were sent to the entire membership of the AOS and ANS with questions regarding biomaterial and prosthesis usage for stapes and chronic ear surgery, as well as satisfaction with each type of prosthesis used. Of the 575 questionnaires mailed, 274 (47%) were returned. Only 248 of the respondents performed middle ear surgery (43%), and their responses constitute the database for this study.
   Results: For those respondents performing stapes surgery in both 1989 and 1999, the mean number of cases per year has increased from 32 to 37 (p less than or equal to 0.004). The mean number of chronic ear cases has also increased from 95 in 1989 to 110 in 1999 (p less than or equal to 0.001), As a biomaterial, hydroxyapatite prostheses are used by most surgeons (82%), followed by autograft and homograft bone (72%), autograft and homograft cartilage (62%), and Plastipore (59%). (Although 62% of respondents use cartilage, only 4.4% ranked it first in preference.) In 1989, bone was used most (93%), followed by cartilage (78%) and Plastipore (81%). Hydroxyapatite, which had just been introduced as a biomaterial, was used by only 9% of respondents. For stapes prostheses in 1999, the majority of respondents used stainless steel/platinum (71%), bucket handle (69%), or partial fluoroplastic (56%) prostheses. There was a high overall satisfaction rate in the use of most of these prostheses (> 85%), with several exceptions. The lowest satisfaction rate was 71% for Plastipore partial ossicular replacement prosthesis and total ossicular replacement prosthesis. Usage and satisfaction rates are presented for specific types of implants and compared with the earlier survey findings.
   Conclusion: The current use of implants in middle ear surgery demonstrates a specific pattern with a high degree of user satisfaction. The preference for implants by respondents has remained stable over the past 10 years; there has been a decrease in the percentage of use of bone, cartilage, and Plastipore with a corresponding increase in the use of hydroxyapatite.

AB  - One hundred sixty-five middle ear procedures were performed with an endoscope, a camera, and a video monitor instead of the microscope. The endoscope offers the following advantages: 1) it visualizes the whole tympanic membrane and the ear canal without having to manipulate the patient's head or the microscope, 2) it extends the operative field in transcanal procedures into structures usually hidden from the microscope (anterior tympanic perforation, posterior retraction pocket, facial recess, and hypotympanum), and 3) it visualizes structures from multiple angles as opposed to the microscope's single axis along the ear canal. Disadvantages of the endoscope include the one-handed surgical technique, a loss of depth perception, limited magnification, and the need for training. The endoscope holds the greatest promise in tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma surgery and should increase the utilization of transcanal over postauricular procedures.

TI  - Endaural Endoscopic Atticoantrotomy (Retrograde Mastoidectomy) using a Constant Suction Bone-drilling Technique
T2  - JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS
LA  - English
AB  - Endoscopic middle ear surgery is a widely employed minimally invasive surgical technique to address middle ear and mastoid pathology. Bone drilling is the main technical challenge of endoscopic middle ear surgery. The accompanying video describes the detailed protocol of a constant-suction bone-drilling technique and the procedure of endaural exclusive endoscopic atticoantrotomy (retrograde mastoidectomy) using this technique. The main components of this bone-drilling technique include a soft and flexible suction tube, which is placed into the tympanic cavity to provide constant suction, and a soft sleeve, which is wrapped around the drill shaft to prevent the high-speed rotating shaft from damaging the lens of the endoscope. With these simple modifications, the traditional otological electrodrill can be used for drilling a tiny endaural incision in endoscopic middle ear surgery. Based on this bone-drilling technique, endaural endoscopic atticoantrotomy (retrograde mastoidectomy) can be successfully established for the removal of various amounts of bone, depending on the extent of the lesion. The short-term postoperative outcome seems promising.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to determine the responsiveness of three instruments (disease-specific, generic, and hearing-specific) assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adult patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media (COM). Study Design Prospective correlational study. Setting Two otology referral centers in England, United Kingdom. Patients Consecutive adult patients undergoing middle ear surgery for COM. Main Outcome Measure(s) HRQoL assessment and audiometry were performed preoperatively and 12 months after surgery. HRQoL was assessed using disease-specific (Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire-12 [COMQ-12]), generic (Euro-Qol-5D-5L), and hearing-specific (Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults [HHIA]) instruments. Results A total of 52 patients (mean [standard deviation {SD}] age, 47.3 [18.3] yr) were included, with 42 patients completing both preoperative and postoperative COMQ-12 forms. COMQ-12 and HHIA total scores significantly improved after surgery (COMQ-12: mean [SD], 28.3 [11.6] versus 14.8 [10.6]; p < 0.001; HHIA: 42.9 (28.4) versus 32.6 (27.5); p = 0.012). General HRQoL measured with the Euro-Qol-5D-5L was unaffected by surgery (p > 0.05). The standardized response means for the COMQ-12 and HHIA total scores were 1.21 and 0.44, respectively. Postoperative air conduction thresholds were moderately correlated with the postoperative COMQ-12 (r = 0.46, p = 0.005) and HHIA (r = 0.41, p = 0.012) total scores. Conclusions Middle ear surgery significantly improved both disease-specific and hearing-specific HRQoL, whereas general HRQoL did not change. Only the COMQ-12 is highly responsive to surgical intervention. This study supports the use of the COMQ-12 to monitor patient-reported outcomes in both research and routine clinical settings.

AB  - This article deals with the development of a robotic solution for middle ear surgery. The surgical procedure consists of the resection of pathological tissues that occurs inside the middle ear cavity known as cholesteatoma. The current surgical procedure is performed manually, is invasive and does not guarantee an exhaustive cholesteatoma tissues removal leading to reoccurrence in 25-30% cases. To remedy this, we developed a new surgical protocol that combines a robotic solution and original surgical instruments. On one side, it consists of a redundant seven degrees of freedom (DoFs) robotic arm extended with a 2 DoFs flexible fibroscope (emulating a future microrobot under development). On the other side, different control architectures are proposed to achieve the surgical procedure. One control mode is based on the teleoperation of whole developed system using a joystick such as an Omni device. The other mode combines comanipulation of the 7 DoFs robotic arm using an embedded force/torque sensor and teleoperation of the remaining 2 DoFs fibroscope using a lab-made in-hand joystick. The proposed materials and methods were validated experimentally using a robotic setup. The obtained results using the different control schemes are discussed.

AB  - Purpose The aim of this study was to determine whether preoperative depressive symptoms influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after middle ear surgery in patients with chronic otitis media (COM). Methods This prospective clinical case study was conducted at a tertiary referral center. All 102 patients who had undergone middle ear surgery for COM were assessed clinically and by audiometric testing (pure tone audiometry) in pre- and postoperative settings. Disease-specific HRQOL was assessed by the validated chronic otitis media outcome test 15 (COMOT-15) and the Zurich chronic middle ear inventory (ZCMEI-21). General HRQOL was measured using the short form 36 (SF-36). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-D). The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was used to classify comorbidities. The middle ear status was determined using the ossiculoplasty outcome parameter staging (OOPS) index. Results After middle ear surgery, the total COMOT-15 and ZCMEI-21 scores improved significantly (p < 0.001). General HRQOL (total SF-36 score) was unaffected by surgery (p < 0.05). Patients without elevated depressive symptoms had significantly better total scores for the COMOT-15 (p < 0.01), ZCMEI-21 (p < 0.001), and for SF-36 (p < 0.001) postoperatively. The results of the multiple regression analyses show that, after adjusting for the OOPS, CCI, and hearing improvement, preoperative depressiveness was significantly associated with worse postoperative COMOT-15 and ZCMEI-21 outcome scores (beta = 0.425 and beta = 0.362,p < 0.001). Conclusion Preoperative depressiveness was an essential predictive factor for HRQOL in patients with COM. This should be considered during patient selection to provide more suitable preoperative counseling.

The patients responded taste and salivation surveys preoperatively, and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively.Main Outcome Measures:We analyzed results of questionnaires including disturbance rates, severity and character to evaluate taste and salivation functions.Results:Taste disturbance rate was significantly improved in all groups during follow-up (p<0.05). The incidence of taste disturbance did not differ significantly between the three groups at each follow-up (p>0.05). The taste disturbance score improved gradually in the cut and intact groups (p<0.001), but not in the manipulated group (p=0.067). Among the patients with taste disturbance, hypoguesia was most common symptom. Incidence of salivation disturbance did not differ between the three groups (p=0.298). However, this symptom improved significantly only in the intact group (p<0.001). The taste and salivation disturbance rate was not different between patients with and without chronic otitis media at 3 and 6 months, and both groups showed significant improvement.Conclusions:Prevalence of taste and salivation disturbance was similar between three groups until 6 months. However, taste disturbance did not improve in the manipulated group and salivation disturbance improved only in the intact group.

AB  - Background: Post-operative nausea vomiting (PONV) is a distressing complaint particularly in high-risk patients. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists has proved a promising role in the prophylaxis of PONV.
   Aim: We aim to compare the anti-emetic responsiveness of ramosetron and palonosetron in post-operative patients of middle ear surgeries.
   Materials and Methods: In the present randomized, prospective double-blind study is including 60 American Society of Anesthesiology Grade I/II female patients, between 25 and 40 years of age undergoing elective middle ear surgeries. Patients were divided into two groups; Group R: Injection ramosetron 0.3 mg (intravenous [IV]) in 2 ml solution and Group P: Injection palonosetron 0.075 mg (IV) made 2 ml after adding 0.5 ml normal saline, were administered for prevention of PONV in the present study. The study drugs were administered before shifting of the patient from the operating room to the post anesthesia care unit. The efficacy, as well as side effects of ramosetron and palonosetron was documented and compared.
   Results: In the present study, the complete response was observed in 90.91% and 70.91% of the patients observed during 0-2 h and 2-24 h respectively in Group R while in Group P no PONV was found in 92.73% and 80% of the patients within the same time frame (P > 0.05). However, during 24-48 h significant complete response was observed among both the groups (P = 0.03). Severity of nausea, retching and vomiting was also found to be significantly high in ramosetron group as compared to the patients received palonosetron. Total rescue antiemetic was given more among ramosetron group. However, no significant difference was observed when compared with palonosetron group (P = 0.11).
   Conclusion: Palonosetron was found an effective and better antiemetic than ramosetron in patients undergoing middle ear surgeries.

AB  - This study investigates the performance of personalised middle ear prostheses under static pressure through a combined approach of numerical analysis and experimental validation. The sound transmission performances of both normal and reconstructed middle ears undergo changes under high positive or negative pressure within the middle ear cavity. This pressure fluctuation has the potential to result in prosthesis displacement/extrusion in patients. To optimise the design of middle ear prostheses, it is crucial to consider various factors, including the condition of the middle ear cavity in which the prosthesis is placed. The integration of computational modelling techniques with non-invasive imaging modalities has demonstrated significant promise and distinct prospects in middle ear surgery. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of Finite Element (FE) analysis in modelling the responses of both normal and reconstructed middle ears to elevated static pressure within the ear canal. The FE model underwent validation using experimental data derived from human cadaveric temporal bones before progressing to subsequent investigations. Afterwards, we assessed stapes and umbo displacements in the reconstructed middle ear under static pressure, with either a columella-type prosthesis or a prosthetic incus, closely resembling a healthy incus. Results indicated the superior performance of the prosthetic incus in terms of both sound transmission to the inner ear and stress distribution patterns on the TM, potentially lowering the risk of prosthesis displacement/extrusion. This study underscores the potential of computational analysis in middle ear surgery, encompassing aspects such as prosthesis design, predicting outcomes in ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR), and mitigating experimental costs.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to present our experience on facing the dehiscent high jugular bulb (HJB) during middle ear surgery in the past 2 decades.
   Study Design: Retrospective review.
   Setting: Secondary referral hospital.
   Patients: From January 1982 to June 2002, consecutive 1,657 patients underwent surgical intervention for middle ear cleft diseases, a total of 1,857 operations. Of them, 10 ears (0.5%) in nine patients were proven to have dehiscent HJB during operation for adhesive otitis media in four ears and for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma in six ears.
   Main Outcome Measures: Each patient underwent otoscopic examination, radiographic examination, and audiometry before and 6 months after operation.
   Results: Otoscopic examination revealed atrophic changes in the pars tensa with adhering to the promontory in two ears, attic retraction in one ear, and both findings in seven ears. All lesions were located beneath the basal turn of the cochlea and the round window niche at anteroinferior and/or posteroinferior quadrants. Active bleeding was encountered in two ears (20%) while elevating the tympanomeatal flap, which was treated by pressure compression associated with gelfoam sheet, then covered with an autologous cartilage to protect the dehiscent bulb. For the remaining eight ears, the bulbs were reinforced with fascia, perichondrium, or autologous cartilage. All 10 ears were allowed completion of the planned surgery without complications.
   Conclusion: HJB is not a contraindication for middle ear surgery. Awareness of this pitfall may lessen the operation risk.

AB  - Objective: To assess chorda tympani nerve function before and after different types of middle ear surgery. The hypothesis was that in cases with cholesteatoma, iatrogenic injury to the nerve results in less postoperative taste disturbance than those undergoing myringoplasty or stapedectomy.
   Study Design: Prospective questionnaire study.
   Setting: ENT Department of a district general hospital in England.
   Patients: Adult patients undergoing middle ear surgery in which there would be elevation of the anulus.
   Main Outcome Measure: Patients' change in taste sensation after surgery with follow-up to demonstrate subsequent recovery.
   Results: A significantly higher incidence of taste disturbance follows myringoplasty and stapedectomy than for procedures in which the initial diagnosis was cholesteatoma, regardless of the extent of injury sustained by the nerve. The most common complaint after chorda tympani nerve injury is of a metallic taste sensation.
   Conclusion: Despite the small patient cohort, the results support the hypothesis that iatrogenic chorda tympani nerve injury in surgery for cholesteatoma results in less postoperative taste disturbance than that for otosclerosis. This may be because the disease process of cholesteatoma renders the nerve hypofunctional. The situation after myringoplasty is less clear. A larger study may help validate these findings.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this prospective single center study was to document the incidence of postoperative taste problems after middle ear surgery with long-term follow-up to assess the evolution. Secondary goals were to evaluate the influence of the pathology and the degree of chorda tympani (CT) manipulation on its function.
   Methods: We used a questionnaire to prospectively assess subjective changes in taste in 40 patients undergoing middle ear surgery. We calculated chemical taste scores for the operated and contralateral side using a chemical taste test protocol. Intraoperative manipulation of the CT was also documented.
   Results: A significant correlation between chemical taste scores on the operated side and the indicated taste was found preoperatively and short-term postoperatively. No correlation was found 3 years after the surgery. A significant correlation between the chemical taste score at the operated side and the degree of CT damage was also found. The chemical taste score on the operated side significantly decreased if the CT was stretched without visible damage in comparison to slightly touched.
   Conclusion: Our results showed that a reduction in subjective taste was a relatively frequent yet transient complication after middle ear surgery. Compensatory mechanisms other than (partial) CT recovery co-existed and could explain the loss of correlation between chemical taste tests and subjective taste evaluation long-term postoperatively. Significant changes in chemical taste scores after CT manipulation suggest that surgeons' intraoperative evaluations of CT manipulation and stretching may be a good predictor of postoperative taste reduction.

AB  - Introduction and Aim: Middle ear surgeries can be performed under local anesthesia and sedation and can be well tolerated by the patient with minimal discomfort. This study was undertaken to compare two techniques of conscious sedation, intravenous midazolam, and propofol infusion for tympanoplasty. Materials and Methods: Forty patients scheduled for right or left tympanoplasty. American Society of Anesthesiologists I or II in age group 18-75 years were included in the study. The patients were randomly allocated into one of the two groups to receive either propofol (group I) or midazolam (group II). Results: The mean duration of anesthesia was 116.00 +/- 33.94 min in group I, while 97.50 +/- 30.76 min in group II (P = 0.07). The modified Ramsay sedation scale was not statistically significant in both the groups. In group I, 70% of the patients and 95% of the patients in group II had amnesia during the surgery (P = 0.091). The mean visual analog scale (VAS) score for surgeons and patients was not statistically significant in both the groups. In group I there was a positive correlation between the total dose of fentanyl and VAS score for surgeons (P = 0.02). There was also a positive correlation between the total dose of propofol and VAS score for surgeons (P = 0.034) and patients (P = 0.039) in group I. Conclusion: Though propofol had shown a faster recovery and less nausea vomiting, we need a larger sample size to conclude, which of the technique is better. Both the techniques are safe, simple and versatile and provide excellent sedation with rapid trouble free recovery.

AB  - Background: In modern reconstructive middle ear surgery imaging plays an essential role as a diagnostic tool, especially in pre-operative planning. Nowadays imaging of surgical results as a matter of quality control in post-operative follow-up becomes more important.
   Material and Methods: Conventional tomography was performed in 10 temporal bone specimen using the CommCat IS 2000-system in order to evaluate anatomical structures and inserted middle ear prostheses (PORP/TORP). This imaging technique has not been used in middle ear surgery beforehand.
   Results: Using conventional tomography characterization of anatomical structures of the temporal bone as e.g. the semicircular canals appeared to be of superior quality to comparable conventional radiographic imaging. Concerning imaging quality (contrast; resolution) conventional tomography allowed similar findings like computed tomography (CT)-scans in some of the investigated specimen while showing inferior sharpness quality due to technical reasons. Further advantages of conventional tomography in contrast to CT were the requirement of just 2.5 % of the CT's irradiation exposure, lack of metallic artefacts caused by implanted prostheses and the feasibility of distance- and angle-measurement of inserted prostheses towards the tympanic membrane which coincided extensively with the temporal bone preparation.
   Conclusions: Conventional tomography enables detailed anatomical imaging of the temporal bone region which out performs conventional radiographic imaging, requires less it-radiation dose than CT and helps avoid problems like metallic artefacts. This technique enhances immediate quality-control and seems to be therefore a promising tool for postoperative evaluation after reconstructive middle ear surgery.

AB  - Introduction: Considerable progress has been made in the development of three-dimensional temporal bone virtual reality simulators. However, very little attention has been paid to interactive simulation of middle ear surgery, including myringotomy. As the development of technical skills for middle ear surgery has a steep learning curve, this poses inherent risks to patients during the skills acquisition phase. The benefit of simulation training in the acquisition of surgical skills has been demonstrated with previous low-fidelity models. Tactile sensation is an important feedback mechanism in middle ear surgery, so a three-dimensional virtual reality myringotomy simulator with haptic feedback was developed at The University of Western Ontario.
   Objective: To examine the face validity of a three-dimensional myringotomy simulator with haptic feedback.
   Methods: The three-dimensional myringotomy simulator was calibrated with input from two otolaryngologists and one intermediate-level resident. The face validity of the resulting simulator was tested by four staff otolaryngologists and seven intermediate-or senior-level residents using a previously validated questionnaire.
   Results: The results demonstrate good to excellent face validity for the myringotomy simulator with high consistency between participants with a Cronbach alpha of .919. Favourable responses predominated for all questions with the exception of force feedback, where the average response was neutral.
   Conclusions: The initial results from the development and testing of a three-dimensional virtual myringotomy simulator with haptic feedback are very encouraging. This simulator is the first of its kind and, with further refinement, has excellent potential to be of benefit in the training of proficient middle ear surgeons.

AB  - Introduction: SAMEO-ATO classification is an international consensual tool published in 2018. In order to evaluate the ease of use and reliability of this classification in pediatric otologic surgery, a retrospective study was conducted in our tertiary referral center. Method: We began to use IOOG classification in September 2018, after a 15-day testing period. In this monocentric retrospective study, we reviewed the classification and the operative charts of all the pediatric middle ear surgeries after the first 5 months of use. Each classification was carefully re-checked by a junior and senior surgeon. In parallel, all the surgeons involved received a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use, with a score from 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy). Results: From September 2018 to February 2019, the tool was used for 119 pediatric surgeries, involving 13 surgeons. The indications for surgery were tympanic membrane perforations (28/119, 23.5%), retraction pockets (36/119, 30.3%), cholesteatoma first procedures (13/119, 10.9%), cholesteatoma revision procedures (41/119, 34.5%) and temporal bone fracture (1/119, 0.8%). All surgical procedures performed could be classified with the ATO-SAMEO classification. We found misclassification in 29/119 cases (24%), 79% of which concerning ATO items. Of the 8 SAMEO-ATO categories in 119 surgeries, the error rate was 4.5% (49/952). Surgeons reported a mean score of use of 4 (quite easy). Conclusion: The easy-to-use SAMEO-ATO classification is well suited for pediatric otology and to the categorization of surgical procedures. However, in a multi-user context, misclassifications were observed in up to a quarter of cases during the first months of use. Carefully anticipated explanations and guidelines given to surgeons should ensure an optimal quality of rating.

AB  - The objective of this prospective study was to compare two methods of predicting the level of hearing benefit following reconstructive middle ear surgery, namely Glasgow benefit plot and Belfast rule of thumb. The correlation of hearing benefit as measured by using these methods was also compared with patient's self-assessment of his/her hearing status. Sixty patients undergoing middle ear reconstructive surgery were studied. Hearing status was assessed pre and post operatively by pure tone audiometry and self-assessment by patient with a questionnaire. The accuracy of predictability of hearing benefit by the two methods was compared with the patient's own assessment. Relevant literature on the subject is reviewed.

AB  - Conclusion: Retroauricular tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy under local anesthesia with sedation can be well tolerated by the patient, with minimum discomfort. Objectives: To evaluate patient discomfort from pain, body/neck position, noise, and anxiety during tympanoplasties and mastoidectomies performed under local anesthesia with sedation. Patients and methods: This was a prospective study of 83 surgeries in 62 patients (28 type I tympanoplasties, 12 tympanoplasties with ossicular reconstruction, 40 canal wall up mastoidectomies, and 3 revision tympanoplasties). Local infiltration used lidocaine 2% with 1: 100 000 epinephrine infiltrated in the retroauricular area and from below the pinna in a 'V' pattern. Sedation was achieved with 50 mg of intramuscular promethazine I h before surgery and intravenous midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) at the beginning of surgery. Subsequent doses of midazolam were given to maintain adequate sedation, up to 10 mg. The discomfort during surgery was assessed by the patient with a score from 0 to 4 (0 =no discomfort and 4 extreme discomfort). Results: Discomfort due to pain had a mean score of 0.83. Noise discomfort (from drilling and manipulation of instruments) had the lowest mean score (0.70), and discomfort from body and neck position had the highest mean score (1.51).

AB  - Background and aim: Tympanoplasty is a common surgery in otorhinolaryngology field. In majority of procedures, in addition to the graft used for closure of tympanic membrane, a packing material is essential to be placed in the middle ear cavity. The main goals of packing can be summarized as providing support to the tympanic membrane and ossicular grafts, aeration of middle ear cavity and hemostasis. Several packing materials are currently available for using in middle ear surgeries. Each agent is associated with particular advantages and disadvantages, so choosing the proper packing agent is essential in tympanoplasty surgeries. In this study we aimed to compare two common packing materials (Gelfoam and silastic sheets) in cartilage tympanoplasty surgeries.
   Methods and materials: In this block-randomized clinical trial, 78 patients undergoing tympanoplasty in Vali-easr hospital in 2017 and 2018 were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to silastic sheet or gelfoam groups. The functional outcomes were compared between the groups. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS.
   Results: Success was achieved in 32 (82.1%) patients and 34 (87.2%) patients in gelfoam and silastic sheets' groups, respectively (p = 0.530). The perforation area percentage was significantly lower (P = 0.007) in Gelfoam group. The other parameters were statistically the same in both groups (P > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Overall, Gelfoam and silastic sheet methods had similar efficacy in cartilage tympanoplasty. Using each method depends on the preferrence of surgeon and patients' characteristics. Multi-center studies with larger sample sizes are needed for more conclusive results.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to identify what proportion of middle-ear surgery patients utilise the internet for information and to characterise which resources and media formats are used and for what durations.MethodA single-arm, retrospective cohort study was performed using an online survey of English-speaking patients who underwent middle-ear surgery over a three-year period across two otology practices.ResultsOf 260 invitees, 165 responded. A total of 122 used online resources: 9.8 per cent used online resources for less than 15 minutes, 27.0 per cent used them for 15 to 29 minutes, 27.0 per cent used them for 30 to 59 minutes and 36.1 per cent used them for 60 minutes or more. Of online users with complete responses (108 of 122), the most used resources (used for 12 minutes or more) were: written information (73.1 per cent); surgeons' websites (55.6 per cent); pictures, diagrams or photos (42.6 per cent); videos (37.0 per cent); and social media (10.2 per cent).ConclusionAt least 46.9 per cent of patients undergoing elective ear surgery use online resources. Most time is spent using written information, pictures, diagrams, photos and videos. Therefore, it is increasingly essential that accurate and informative resources in these formats are readily available online.

AB  - The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) is a measure of patient benefit developed especially for otorhinolaryngological (ORL) interventions. Patient benefit is the change in health status resulting from health care intervention. The GBI was developed to be patient-oriented, to be maximally sensitive to ORL interventions, and to provide a common metric to compare benefit across different interventions. The GBI is an 18-item, postintervention questionnaire intended to be given to patients to fill in at home or in the outpatient clinic. In the first part of the paper, five different ORL interventions were retrospectively studied: middle ear surgery to improve hearing, provision of a cochlear implant, middle ear surgery to eradicate ear activity, rhinoplasty, and tonsillectomy. A criterion that was specific to the intervention was selected for each study, so that the patient outcome could be classified as above and below criterion. In all five interventions, the GBI was found to discriminate between above- and below-criterion outcomes. The second part of the paper reports on the results and implications of a factor analysis of patient responses. The factor structure was robust across the study, and so led to the construction of subscales. These subscales yield a profile score that provides information on the different types of patient benefit resulting from ORL interventions. The GBI is sensitive to the different ORL interventions, yet is sufficiently general to enable comparison between each pair of interventions. It provides a profile score, which enables further breakdown of results. As it provides a patient-oriented common metric, it is anticipated that the GBI will assist audit, research, and health policy planning.

TI  - CERAMIC IMPLANTS IN OTOLOGIC SURGERY
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLOGY

AB  - The suitability of ceramic materials for reconstruction in middle ear surgery was examined. The excellent tolerance of bio-inert aluminum oxide ceramic implanted into the middle ear was shown by EM studies and clinical experience. Implants developed for ossicular chain reconstruction were covered by a delicate middle ear mucous membrane within a few wk. No foreign body reactions were observed. The ceramic prostheses are distinguished by the almost unlimited number of forms or shapes into which they can be ground quickly and precisely during the operation. Al2O3 ceramic implants were used because there is no bony fixation with the surrounding bone, but rather a jointlike connection with the remaining parts of the ossicular chain. The composition of resorbable tricalcium phosphate, bio-active ceramic, corresponds to the inorganic component of bone. Because it exhibits the characteristic of being replaced by autogenous bone, it is considered for the obliteration of mastoid cavities.Based on preliminary experiences, dense tricalcium phosphate ceramic might play a valuable role in the reconstruction of the posterior auditory canal wall. Dense tricalcium phosphate ceramic was used to correct minor ossicular chain defects (for example, erosin of the long process of the incus). A survey is given concerning the indications and techniques for the use of these new materials in middle ear surgery, as well as the results covering a period of 3 yr, which are very encouraging as far as compatibility and function are concerned.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to characterize self-reported postoperative pain after tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy and correlate pain severity with the patient's preoperative anxiety state.Study Design Prospective cohort study.Setting Tertiary referral medical center.Patients Adult patients undergoing any middle ear surgery between July 2018 and July 2019.Main Outcome Measures Patient responses to an otology questionnaire (OQ) for scoring pain intensity on a visual analog scale preoperatively and on postoperative days (PODs) 1-4, 21, and 63. The responses were correlated with anxiety state (assessed by State-Trait Personality Inventory [STPI] scores) and clinical and operative data, including surgical technique-related details.Results Sixty patients were enrolled (mean age +/- standard deviation, 40 +/- 19.7 yr, 26 men). Their median preoperative (baseline) visual analog scale pain score was 6 on POD1, 5 on POD3, and 1 at 3 and 7 weeks. Their median preoperative OQ score was 32 of 70 (45.7%), 37 of 70 (52.8%) on POD1, 33 of 70 (47.1%) on POD3, 6 of 70 (8.5%) at 3 weeks, and 6 of 70 at 7 weeks. Their overall mean preoperative anxiety level (STPI score) was 2.63 +/- 1.50. STPI scores were significantly higher among patients who reported OQ scores equal to or higher than the median during PODs 1 to 4 in comparison to patients who reported OQ scores lower than the median. The alpha Cronbach correlation between anxiety and postoperative pain scores on POD1 was 0.97.Conclusion Preoperative anxiety levels are closely associated with postoperative pain levels after any middle ear surgery. Measures to control preoperative anxiety are warranted to alleviate postoperative pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carbomethylcellulose (CMC) foam has been widely adopted to promote hemostasis and healing in sinus surgery. There has been interest in the use of CMC in middle ear surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CMC foam for use in middle ear surgery.
   STUDY DESIGN: Prospective, controlled.
   SETTING: Academic research laboratory.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Adult guinea pigs underwent experimental tympanoplasty followed by packing of the middle ear (n = 19 per group) with CMC, hyaluronic acid (HA), or gelatin sponge (GS). Auditory evoked brainstem response testing and otomicroscopy were performed before and serially for eight weeks after surgery. Tympanic membrane healing, hemostasis, and retention of packing material were assessed.
   RESULTS: All tympanic membranes treated with CMC healed by week eight. Less postoperative bleeding was observed with CMC than with HA or GS. Surgery elevated auditory thresholds, at least temporarily, in all groups. However, CMC was associated with greater auditory threshold elevation (15-25 dB) at eight weeks across all test frequencies relative to HA or GS (P < 0.01). Residual CMC and scarring were not found in the middle ear, indicating that the hearing loss was sensorineural. No head tilt posturing suggestive of vestibulopathy was seen.
   CONCLUSION: CMC was associated with hearing loss and may be ototoxic. Therefore, CMC should not be used in human middle ears given the presence of several nontoxic alternative materials. (c) 2010 American Academy of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Foundation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Patients with otosclerosis more often complain about postoperative taste disturbance than patients with chronic otitis media, which seems paradoxical. We aim to investigate if and potentially why this seems to be the case, since the chorda tympani nerve (CTN) is thought to be severely traumatized less frequently during surgery in the former than in the latter. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Hospital of Vastmanland, Vasteras, Sweden. Patients: Sixty-five adults undergoing primary middle ear surgery were included. Thirty-seven were operated on for chronic suppurative otitis media with or without cholesteatoma (CSOM) and 28 for otosclerosis. Interventions: Middle ear surgery due to otosclerosis or CSOM. Subjective and objective taste measurements and quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. Main Outcome Measures: Taste was assessed using electrogustometry (EGM) and the filter paper disc (FPD) method before and up to 1 year after surgery. Questionnaires on taste disturbance, including a visual analogue scale (VAS), and QoL were completed before and up to 1 year after surgery. Results: Subjective taste disturbance anytime during the 1-year follow-up were reported by 62 and 46%, respectively. The difference in EGM 1 week after surgery compared with preoperative EGM was significantly greater among CSOM patients than otosclerosis. One year postoperatively, the difference is non-significant. Conclusion: Surgery for CSOM causes greater initial and more long-lasting taste disturbances as compared with surgery for otosclerosis. One-year postoperative taste normalizes for both CSOM and otosclerosis patients according to VAS and EGM measurements. No real change in QoL was seen 1-year postop

AB  - Nowadays all procedures in tympanoplasty are performed using conventional instrumentation without any mechatronic based manipulators. A micromanipulator system (MMS) holds microinstruments and transmits the surgeon's hand movements to a monitor, thus, improving precision and ergonomics.
   Using the Cartesian principle, a telemanipulator with three linear degrees of freedom controlled with a joystick was designed. The three axes are powered by a servomotor. The manipulator is equipped with a sterilizable instrument holder, which is placed on a sterile covered system. On this instrument holder, sterile surgical instruments can be clipped and can be easily changed during surgery. In the scope of this study, the MMS was used to perform a tympanoplasty III in 20 patients. A workflow expert protocol, a video of the surgery, and a questionnaire completed by all surgeons were evaluated.
   Clinical use of the MMS 2.0 was performed in all 20 patients as planned. A partial/total ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP/TORP) was used in all cases with the MMS as planned. Significantly more time was necessary not only to prepare for surgery but also to prepare the equipment intraoperatively, and the incision to suture time was longer. The number of intraoperative changes of instruments decreased by 24%. The frequency of contact between the instrument and the prosthesis was significantly decreased. All questionnaires indicated that further improvement of the MMS is needed.
   The manipulator MMS 2.0 was successfully used in the clinical setting for the first time. The tool offers great potential for middle ear surgery (e.g., tympanoplasty III, stapes surgery and cochlear implant insertion). The principal of telemanipulation (master-slave) could be transferred to middle ear surgery. However, numerous technical improvements are still required.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic otitis media (COM), affecting millions globally, remains a significant health concern despite antibiotic advancements. Evolving otological approaches focus on both dry ear attainment and hearing restoration. Grading systems such as middle ear risk index (MERI) can aid in stratifying disease severity and predicting surgical outcomes for effective patient management. Aims and Objectives: The study aimed to assess MERI scores in tympanomastoid surgery patients to categorize disease severity and evaluate its correlation with postoperative hearing improvement. Materials and Methods:A prospective study was conducted over 2 years on 50 patients of COM. Patients were categorized into three groups based on MERI scores developed by Becvarovski and Kartush. A preoperative audiometry was obtained. The type of middle ear surgery required for each patient was decided intraoperatively as per the findings. Patients were followed up for a 6-month period, and hearing improvement was assessed in terms of closure of air-bone gap in the postoperative audiogram. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v23 software for Windows, and P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: In our study, significant associations (P < 0.05) were observed between the "MERI category" and variables such as otorrhea, cholesteatoma, ossicular status, previous surgery, middle ear granulation/effusion, smoker, total MERI score, and surgery performed. MERI was found to be negatively associated with hearing improvement, the higher the score lesser the improvement in hearing, and vice versa. Conclusion The incorporation of MERI scoring into the surgical evaluation of COM cases holds promise for improving patient care and treatment strategies.

AB  - Background: Given that the temporal bone is one of the most complex regions of the human body, cadaveric dissection of this anatomical area represents the first necessary step for the learning and training of the young oto-surgeon in order to perform middle ear surgery, which includes the management of inflammatory pathology, hearing rehabilitation, and also cognitive decline prevention surgery. The primary objective of this study was to identify common mistakes and critical passages during the initial steps of temporal bone dissection, specifically cortical mastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy. Methods: A survey among 100 ENT residents was conducted, gathering insights into the most prevalent errors encountered during their training to uncover the most challenging aspects faced by novice surgeons during these procedures. Results: The most common mistakes included opening the dura of the middle cranial fossa (MCF), injury of the sigmoid sinus (SS), chorda tympani (CT), and facial nerve (FN) injury while performing the posterior tympanotomy. The most important critical steps to prevent mistakes are related to the absence of wide exposure during cortical mastoidectomy and the consequent impossibility of identifying the landmarks of the facial recess before performing posterior tympanotomy. Injury of these structures was more common in younger surgeons and in the ones who performed less than five temporal bone dissection courses. Conclusions: Numerous temporal bone dissections on cadavers are mandatory for ENT residents looking forward to performing middle ear surgery.

AB  - Background: Hearing impairment is an established independent risk factor for delirium.Whether preoperative hearing impairment is associated with postoperative emergence agitation (POEA) in elderly patients remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association between preoperative hearing impairment and POEA in elderly patients undergoing ear surgery. Methods: This prospective observational study was carried out at an otologic centre in a tertiary hospital between July 15, 2020, and February 28, 2021. Data of 417 elderly patients who underwent microscopic and endoscopic middle ear surgery were analyzed. Pure tone average was used to assess preoperative hearing function, with a PTA >= 50 dB indicating severe hearing impairment. POEA was measured using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between preoperative hearing function and POEA. Results: Of the 417 participants, 45.8% were men, and the median age was 64 (interquartile range: 62-67) years old. Severe preoperative hearing impairment was present in 113 patients (27.1%), and POEA occurred in 42 patients (10.1%). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that severe preoperative hearing impairment was associated with an increased risk of POEA (odds ratio: 2.031; 95% confidence interval: 1.044-3.954, P = 0.037). Conclusion: Pending confirmative studies, these findings suggest that severe preoperative hearing impairment could serve as an independent predictor of POEA in older patients undergoing middle ear surgery. These results highlight the need for further research to better understand the biomarker and pathogenesis of POEA, leading to identification of targeted interventions of POEA and improvement of postoperative outcomes in patients.

AB  - The application of computer modelling for medical purposes, although challenging, is a promising pathway for further development in the medical sciences. We present predictive neural and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) models for hearing improvements after middle ear surgery for chronic otitis media. The studied data set comprised 150 patients characterised by the set of input variables: age, gender, preoperative audiometric results, ear pathology and details of the surgical procedure. The predicted (output) variable was the postoperative hearing threshold. The best neural models developed in this study achieved 84% correct predictions for the test data set while the k-NN model produced only 75.8% correct predictions. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - When evaluating the outcome of reconstructive middle ear surgery, it is insufficient to use only the achieved improvement of audiometric measurement results. Although, as functional parameters, they occupy a central position in the therapeutic assessment of the ear as a sensory organ, they must be supplemented by a number of modern quality control factors. Different perspectives for assessment of quality must be taken into account. What is important from the patient's point of view may not be the same factors as to the physician, while the physician places a high value on factors that are less significant for the medical insurance company. The international otological community, who would like to draw conclusions from middle ear surgery data, might set different criteria altogether for assessing quality of surgery.
   Hence, we propose to adapt the general concept of quality to middle ear surgery. This must be implemented on different levels and surgical therapy of middle ear diseases must be understood as a process.
   This means that new aspects must be included in quality assessment, This means that quality assessment must comprise additional aspects, which include a structured description and recording of disease-specific symptoms, findings, and outcome of treatment. Furthermore, in today's world the use of internationally recognized classification systems must be regarded as a quality feature, in order to make results not only publishable but also capable of meta-analysis. Internationally developed and recognized reporting systems are available for this purpose. Their use in routine care not only makes the collected data internationally comparable, but also enables systematic evaluation within the institution for quality description and control.
   In addition to audiological measurement results, surgical quality indicators are considered. We also focus on emerging complications and the value of systematic and structured evaluation and documentation systems. Validated measuring instruments are already available for patient benefit assessment, the use of which should no longer be limited to scientific studies. In summary, quality assessment of surgery should be extended to include not only the "patient as a whole", but also to the "therapy process as a whole", incorporating features of structural and process quality.

AB  - Traditional surgery for cholesteatoma of the middle ear is performed by microscopic approaches. However, in recent years endoscopic instrumentation, techniques and knowledge have greatly improved, and in our opinion endoscopic surgical techniques will gain increasing importance in otologic surgery in the future. The aim of this study was to focus on outcomes obtained using endoscopic surgery for the treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma. A systematic review of the literature was performed. A total of 7 articles comprising 515 patients treated exclusively with endoscope or with a combined technique were found. During post-surgical follow-up, 48 (9.3%) patients showed a residual or recurrent pathology. Despite the small number of patients analyzed in our review, the outcomes of this technique appear to be promising. In particular, concerning the rates of recurrences and residual disease, endoscopic middle ear surgery appears to guarantee similar results in comparison to classic microscopic approaches with the advantage of performing minimally invasive surgery.

AB  - Objectives: To compare the administration of sub hypnotic dose of propofol with metoclopramide and placebo in prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after middle ear surgery.
   Methods: This clinical research was performed in the Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Besevler, Ankara, Turkey, between December 2004 and October 2005. Following approval by the hospital ethics committee, 60 adult patients scheduled for a middle ear operation were randomly assigned into 3 groups. The patients in group P received 0.5 mg.kg(-1) propofol; in group M, 0.2 mg.kg(-1) metoclopramide, and in group C, 0.9% saline solution. The number of patients suffering from nausea and vomiting at 0-4, 4-12, and 12-24 hours postoperatively, and additional use of antiemetics was recorded.
   Results: Comparison of the data showed that at 0-4th hours, the incidence of vomiting was 25% in group P, 40% in group M, and 75% in group C. The incidence rate of group P was significantly lower than that of group C (p=0.002), and the rate of antiemetics use in group C was higher than that in group P (p=0.028). The Nausea Vomiting Scale scores of group C were also significantly higher than those of group P (P=0.005). There were no significant differences between the values at 4-12 and 12-24 hours.
   Conclusion: The administration of a sub hypnotic dose of propofol at the end of surgery was found to be at least as effective as metoclopramide in preventing PONV in the early postoperative period in adult patients undergoing middle ear surgery.

AB  - Objective: To compare measured and perceived taste function before and after surgery of patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma (OMCC) to patients without cholesteatoma (patients with chronic suppurative otitis media [CSOM] and patients with lateral skull base lesions [LSB]). Methods: This prospective cohort study included 29 patients undergoing surgery for unilateral OMCC. The chorda tympani nerve (CTN) was resected in 8 of these patients. Fourteen patients undergoing surgery for unilateral CSOM and 5 patients undergoing surgery for unilateral LSB (with CTN resection) served as the comparison group. Taste function was measured using taste strips on both sides of the tongue before surgery, 2 weeks postoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. The affected side of the tongue was compared to the unaffected side. A questionnaire on taste perception was completed at each visit. Results: Preoperatively, cholesteatoma patients showed higher taste strip scores than non-cholesteatoma patients, indicating a larger difference between the healthy and affected sides of the tongue. Despite this difference in measured taste function few cholesteatoma patients reported taste alteration before surgery (3/29 [10.3%]). Postoperatively, patients with CTN resection (OMCC patients with CTN resection and LSB patients) showed a decreased measured taste function. Subjectively, only approximately 20% of these patients reported taste alteration 3 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Before surgery, cholesteatoma patients displayed an impaired measured taste function compared to patients without cholesteatoma (CSOM, LSB). Subjectively this was often unnoticed. After surgery, despite removal of the CTN and consequent reduction of measured taste function, few patients reported taste alteration and subjective taste perception was seen to be improving. In regards to middle ear surgery, perceived taste function does not seem to reflect measured gustatory function.

AB  - A retrospective evaluation of glass ionomer cement (GIC) in middle ear surgery with emphasis on short- and long-term safety was conducted at the tertiary referral center. GIC was applied between 1995 and 2006 in 444 patients in otologic surgery. Technical aspects, safety, benefits and complications due to GIC were analysed until 2011 (follow-up 5-16 years; mean 10 years). GIC was applied in stapes surgery (228 primary, 92 revisions), cochlear implants (108) and implantable hearing aids (7), ossiculoplasty (7), for coverage of opened mastoid air cells towards the external ear canal (1) and inner ear fistula closure (1). GIC turned out to be very handy in stapes surgery for optimal prosthesis fixation at the incus (260) and on the malleus handle (60) without complications. Results suggest that GIC may diminish the danger of incus necrosis in primary stapedotomy. In cochlear implants and implantable hearing aids, GIC was used for casing alone (74), casing and electrode fixation (27) and electrode alone fixation (14). Inflammatory reactions were observed in five cases (4.3 %), mostly after trauma. Broken cement fragments appeared to promote foreign body rejection. In seven cases an incudo-stapedial gap was repaired with GIC with excellent hearing gain; in three cases (43 %) revision surgery was needed due to cement breakage. In one case, GIC was applied for a watertight coverage of opened mastoid cells, and in the other for fistula closure of the lateral semi-circular canal over cartilage, covered with bone path,; follow-up was uneventful. Targeted use of GIC in middle ear surgery rarely poses problems. GIC cannot be used in neuro-otosurgery in contact with cerebrospinal fluid because of possible aluminium encephalopathy.

AB  - BackgroundEndoscopic ear surgery has numerous benefits, such as the capacity to obtain high-resolution pictures and visualize normally inaccessible locations such as the retrotympanum, sinus tympani, and facial recess. These areas are generally difficult to access with traditional microscopic techniques. Endoscopic ear surgery reduces operating time when performed by skilled surgeons, without the need for a postauricular incision wound.An essential aspect to consider when evaluating the effects of any procedure on individual satisfaction is the assessment of health-associated quality of life. It is a tool used for subjective assessment, which is regarded as a reliable measure of the satisfaction perceived-whether physically or mentally-resulting from a certain procedure.The goal of this study was to identify the benefits of middle ear surgery when done endoscopically compared to postauricular microscopic techniques in middle ear surgery. This was achieved by evaluating and comparing the level of satisfaction among patients who underwent either microscopic or endoscopic ear surgery.BackgroundEndoscopic ear surgery has numerous benefits, such as the capacity to obtain high-resolution pictures and visualize normally inaccessible locations such as the retrotympanum, sinus tympani, and facial recess.

This knowledge can be valuable in preoperative counseling. Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) seems to have a higher level of cosmetic acceptability, especially in terms of enhancing the socially related aspects of a patient's pleasure. This work thus supports the ongoing integration of endoscope utilization in otological surgical procedures.

TI  - Persistent Stapedial Artery Encountered during Cochlear Implantation
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Objectives. Persistent stapedial artery (PSA) is a rare congenital anomaly that can complicate middle ear surgery. Methods. We present the case of a 25-year-old male who underwent right-sided cochlear implantation. A PSA was encountered lying over the middle promontory intraoperatively. Results. The PSA was carefully lifted off the middle ear promontory using a Hughes elevator to divide adhesions and delineate the artery. The implant electrode was placed through the round window niche in the usual fashion. Tragal cartilage and fibrin glue were used to control the trajectory of the electrode. Conclusion. Cochlear implantation can be performed safely in patients with PSA.

AB  - Objective: To estimate the reliability of the Bone Conduction-HeadBand (BC-HB) test for predicting the postoperative functional outcome of a round-window (RW) vibroplasty.
   Study Design: Within-subject comparison of the functional results of the BC-HB test, which is routinely used for the preoperative evaluation of a bone-conduction transducer, with an active middle ear implant (AMEI) placed onto the round window.
   Setting: Tertiary referral university hospital center.
   Patients: Seven patients with similar anatomic (absent stapes superstructure) and functional (moderate, mixed hearing loss) sequelae from open tympanoplasty technique.
   Intervention: All subjects underwent preoperative audiologic assessment with the BC-HB. Subsequently, all subjects underwent surgical placement of an AMEI onto the round window.
   Main Outcome Measure: Pure tone and speech audiometry in quiet and noise were assessed. Additionally, evaluation of specific satisfactory targets was performed using the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement.
   Results: Pure tone and speech audiometry in quiet established that both devices had very similar performance and provided remarkable improvement compared with the unaided condition. However, high-frequency gain and speech audiometry in noise demonstrated better performance with RW-AMEI.
   Conclusion: In patients presenting with mixed hearing loss as a sequela from middle ear surgery, the preoperative BC-HB test may be helpful in predicting the final functional outcome and patient satisfaction with RW-AMEI.

KW  - EUROPE
AB  - Introduction: In Internet forums and other social media many reports regarding chronic headaches after cochlear implantation can be found. Although quite rare, there are also some reports in the literature. However, little is known regarding the true prevalence of headaches in persons who have undergone cochlear implant surgery.
   Objectives: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the 1-year prevalence of headache in patients having received a cochlear implantation ("cochlear implant group'') in comparison with patients having undergone middle ear surgery ("surgery group'') and persons with no history of head and neck surgery ("non-ear-nose-throat [ENT] group'').
   Methods: Cross-sectional, monocentric study using a validated headache questionnaire.
   Results: Three hundred persons were asked to participate. Two hundred thirty four valid questionnaires were returned. The participants' median age was 62 years, of whom 45% were women. The prevalence of headache was 31% (95%confidence interval [CI]: [21; 42]) in the cochlear implant group and 46% (95%-CI: [35; 57]) in the surgery group with no significant difference between these two subgroups (p = 0.071). In the non-ENT group the prevalence of headache was significantly higher than in the other two subgroups (64%, 95%-CI: [52; 74]).
   Discussion: The prevalence of headache is not higher in cochlear implant patients in comparison to middle ear surgery patients, other, non-ENT patients and the general German or European population.
   Conclusion: Cochlear implantation does not seem to be associated with an increased risk for developing headache.

AB  - Introduction Lateral skull base (LSB) and middle ear pathologies often involve the facial nerve (FN), and their treatment may require FN sacrifice. Cases with unidentifiable proximal stump or intact FN with complete FN palsy, necessitate FN anastomosis with another motor nerve in order to restore innervation to the mimicking musculature. The results of hypoglossal-to-facial nerve anastomosis (HFA) and masseteric-facial nerve anastomosis in patients with facial paralysis after middle ear and LSB surgeries, are presented and compared. Methods Adult patients with total definitive facial paralysis after middle ear or LSB surgery undergoing facial nerve reanimation through hypoglossal or masseteric transfer anastomosis were enrolled. The facial nerve function was graded according to the House Brackmann grading system (HB). The facial function results at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and at the last follow up (more than 18 months) are compared. Results 153 cases of LSB and middle ear surgery presented postoperative facial palsy and underwent facial nerve reanimation surgery with HF in 85 patients (55.5%) and MF in 68 patients (44.5%). The duration of the FN palsy before reconstructive surgery was inversely associated to better FN results, in particular with having a grade III HB (p = 0.003). Both techniques had significantly lower HB scores when an interval between palsy onset and reanimation surgery was 6 months or less (MF p = 0.0401; HF p = 0.0022). Patients who underwent a MF presented significant improvement of the FN function at 3 months from surgery (p = 0.0078). At the last follow-up, 63.6% recovered to a grade III HB and 22.7% to a grade IV. On the other hand, the first significant results obtained in the HF group were at 6 months from surgery (p < 0.0001). 67.8% of patients had a grade III HB after a HF at the last follow-up, 28.8% a grade IV. FN grading at 6 months from surgery was significantly lower in the MF group compared to the HF (p = 0.0351). The two techniques had statistically similar results at later follow-up evaluations. Discussion/Conclution MF was associated to initial superior results, presenting significant facial recovery at 3 months, and significantly better functional outcomes at 6 months from surgery compared to HF. Although later results were not significantly different in this study, earlier results have an important role in order to limit the duration of risk of corneal exposure.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to evaluate postoperative spatial speech discrimination in noise in a group of otosclerotic patients with unilateral hearing loss in a 6-month follow-up. Moreover, an additional objective is to verify if our routine criteria (air-bone gap >30 dB at 250-2,000 Hz) for surgical indication in such patients can be acceptable.
   Study Design: Prospective evaluation in 20 patients divided into 2 groups: unilateral otosclerosis and bilateral otosclerosis already successfully operated on 1 side and planned for stape-dotomy on the contralateral ear.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center, University clinic.
   Patients: Otosclerotic patients with unilateral hearing loss.
   Intervention: Evaluation of functional outcome.
   Main Outcome Measure: Spatial test based on speech discrimination in noise.
   Results: All patients reach postoperative air- bone gap closure within 10 dB. Average postoperative gain in discrimination under noise was 11.5% for unilateral otosclerosis group and 19.3% for the second ear group.
   Conclusion: Free-field discrimination in noise closely reflects the usual listening conditions in everyday life. Improvement in postoperative free-field discrimination in noise can justify our routine criteria for surgical indication in the patients with unilateral otosclerosis and with bilateral otosclerosis already operated on 1 side. The surgical choice for each patient, apart from audiologic evaluation, is linked to a truly informed consent regarding possible advantages and risks mainly based on an analysis of the real auditory needs of the patient and individual results of the surgeon.

AB  - BackgroundThe number of potential options for rehabilitation of patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss is continually expanding. To be able to inform patients and other stakeholders, there is a need to identify and develop patient-centred outcomes for treatment of hearing loss.
   Objective of reviewTo identify outcome measures in the physical core area used when reporting the outcome after treatment of conductive and mixed hearing loss in adult patients.
   Type of reviewSystematic review.
   Search strategySystematic review of the literature related to reported physical outcome measures after treatment of mixed or conductive hearing loss without restrictions regarding type of intervention, treatment or device.
   Evaluation methodAny measure reporting the physical outcome after treatment or intervention of mixed or conductive hearing loss was sought and categorised. The physical outcome measures that had been extracted were then grouped into domains.
   ResultsThe literature search resulted in the identification of 1434 studies, of which 153 were selected for inclusion in the review. The majority (57%) of papers reported results from middle ear surgery, with the remainder reporting results from either bone conduction hearing devices or middle ear implants. Outcomes related to complications were categorised into 17 domains, whereas outcomes related to treatment success was categorised into 22 domains.
   ConclusionsThe importance of these domains to patients and other stakeholders needs to be further explored in order to establish which of these domains are most relevant to interventions for conductive or mixed hearing loss. This will allow us to then assess which outcome measures are most suitable for inclusion in the core set.

AB  - Objective The objective of this prospective, single-subject, repeated measures study was to evaluate the audiological benefit and patient satisfaction with an adhesive, pressure-free bone conduction hearing system (ADHEAR; MED-EL, Innsbruck, Austria) in patients who underwent middle ear surgery with transient hearing loss due to auditory canal tamponade. Methods Eleven adult subjects suffering from transient conductive hearing loss were enrolled in the study and followed up to 3 weeks after middle ear surgery. Bone and air conduction thresholds were measured pre and postoperatively to evaluate eligibility for enrollment. Postoperative unaided and aided sound-field thresholds, as well as speech tests in quiet and noise were compared to confirm hearing improvement with the hearing system. To determine patient satisfaction, the SSQ12 and a system-specific quality of life questionnaire was administered to all subjects. Results Speech perception for monosyllables in quiet improved by 46%, with statistical significance for the ADHEAR system compared to the unaided condition after one week. The functional hearing gain improved by 19 dB. Speech perception in noise with the device was - 6.7 dB SNR on average, with a statistically significant improvement of 2.7 dB SNR. The results of the questionnaire showed a high level of patient satisfaction and subjective hearing improvement. No serious skin reactions or other severe complications occurred. Conclusion As long as the auditory canal is blocked due to tamponade, patients benefit from hearing rehabilitation. This adhesive hearing system is a safe and effective device to treat transient conductive hearing loss and may considerably improve treatment for patients even with short-term hearing loss.

AB  - Study Objectives: To determine the incidence of postoperative nausea tend vomiting when a combination of ondansetron and promethazine is given prophylactically, and to ascertain the effect of postoperative nausea and vomiting on recovery room duration and patient satisfaction.
   Design: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study.
   Setting: University-affiliated tertiary-care hospital.
   Patients: 87 ASA physical status I and II adult patients scheduled for middle ear surgery. Interventions: Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of th following interventions intravenously: ondansetron 4 mg (Group 1), promethazine 25 mg (Group 2), ondansetron 2 mg plus promethazine 12.5 mg (Group 3, combination), or placebo (Group 4).
   Measurements and Main Results: Independent, study blinded observers recorded complaints of nausea and number of episodes of vomiting for 24 hours following the patient's first response to commands. All patients were contacted the day after discharge to inquire about nausea and vomiting. The awakening time, postanesthesia care unit and day surgery unit durations, opioid use, and side effects were recorded. At the end of the 24-hour period, the study blinded observers asked patients for an overall assessment of their global anesthesia experience using an 11-point scale. During the 24-hour period, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was reduced from 74 % (placebo) to 39 % (promethazine; p = 0.03) and 29 % (combination; p = 0.003). Compared with placebo the severity of vomiting was significantly less in the combination group (p = 0.04). The number of very satisfied patients correlated negatively with the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (p < 0.0001) and with the severity of vomiting (p = 0.003).
   Conclusion: The prophylactic use of an antiemetic with middle ear surgery may reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting over 24 hours, and the ondansetron/promethazine combination or promethazine alone are cost-effective choices. Finally, the combination reduced significantly the severity of vomiting. (C) 1999 by Elsevier Science Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Preserving maximal quality of life is an important factor in middle ear surgery according to current standards. Taste disturbance is a common postoperative complication, which can be explained with the risk of injury due to the localisation of chorda tympani. The knowledge about this complication is mandatory for optimal surgical decision-making and for patient education as well. Objective: Investigation of early postoperative taste disturbances, to clarify the differences between the impact of different surgical interventions, and the impact of nerve manipulation. Methods: 15 stapes surgeries and 28 tympanoplasties were investigated. Patients answered subjective questionnaires before surgery and on the first postoperative day. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to measure the degree of disturbances (0-10). Degree of nerve manipulation was classified into 5 groups. Results: No significant differences between the impact of stapes surgeries and tympanoplasties could be found (9, 9.1; p = 0.861). In groups '0', '1' and '2', the VAS scores were 10, 9.26, and 8.5. Between the groups "no manipulation" (0) and "significant manipulation without macroscopic injury" (2), the difference was significant (10, 8.5; p = 0.039). In the stapes surgery group, no severe taste disturbance (VAS<5) was found. Discussion: In the case of adequate microscopic surgical technique, the rate of postoperative taste disturbances is relatively low. Conclusions: The rate of postoperative taste disturbance could be kept at a low level while the continuity of the chorda tympani could be preserved in the majority of cases. The postoperative morbidity rate is primarily influenced by the degree of nerve manipulation and not by the type of surgery.

AB  - Auditing in middle ear surgery, feasibility of the common otology database. Objectives: Clinical auditing is a systematic process for improving quality of care. The primary goal is to compare current practice with established standards. A common dataset enables the comparison of results, and takes into account the effect of case mix, surgical techniques and follow-up periods on outcome.
   The Common Otology Database (COD) is a joint effort of an international group of otologists to standardise reporting on middle ear surgery, including myringoplasty, ossiculoplasty, stapes surgery and cholesteatoma removal. It aims to identify audit data using the internet (http://www.ear-audit.net), provide a storage system for otological data, to create a prospective database allowing statistical analysis with sufficient power and to produce standards for comparative auditing.
   Materials and methods: The COD provides two levels of data entry, anonymising surgeon and patient data. Level 1 is designed for general otorhinolaryngologists and trainees, and only records main outcomes. Level 2 is designed for benchmark otologists and includes detailed information about pathologies, risk factors, aim of surgery, surgical findings, procedures, follow-up periods and complications. Level-2 surgeons are required to submit pre-operative data on all patients scheduled for surgery in order to eliminate bias as a result of selective reporting.
   Results: The COD began in January 2004 and is continuously including patients. In May 2009, 2,291 cases were entered in the level-2 benchmark database, including 1,218 myringoplasties (53.2%), 576 ossiculoplasties (25.1%), 695 stapes surgeries (30.3%) and 532 cholesteatoma surgeries (23.2%). Currently, 151 surgeons use the database system (levels 1 and 2 combined). Eighteen otologists were invited to contribute to the level 2 database. Eight contributors complied with the validation criteria. Others did not cooperate, citing a lack of resources to support data input, or their health system discouraging follow-up. Some were also reluctant to have their outcome data subjected to external validation.
   Conclusion: The COD has engaged the otological community to participate in a large-scale audit of current practice. The number of surgical procedures included has attained a level of power that will allow introductory statistical analysis.

AB  - Background: A relatively bloodless microscopic field is essential to facilitate surgical exposure in Simple Middle Ear Surgery (SMES). Our aim was to compare dexmedetomedine with midazolam in reducing bleeding in SMES performed under local anesthesia.
   Methods: In this prospective, double-blind, comparative study, 54 patients undergoing SMES randomly received intravenous sedative infusion of either: Dexmedetomedine (Group D) or midazolam (Group M) titrated to a bispectral index reading of 70-80. Pain on local anesthesia injection was assessed by a verbal rating scale. Using a 3-grades score, the surgeon assessed the quality of surgical bleeding. Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and Heart Rate (HR) were assessed. Time parameters recorded include: time to reach adequate sedation, surgery duration, sedation recovery and postanesthesia care unit discharge. Patient satisfaction, visual analog scale for intraoperative pain, and number of patients required rescue fentanyl were recorded. Adverse effects were also recorded.
   Results: Surgical field bleeding score was significantly better in group D compared to group M (Grade I: 18 vs 4, Grade II: 9 vs 19, Grade III: 0 vs 4, respectively) p < 0.001. Intraoperative MAP and HR in group D were lower than their baseline values and the corresponding values in group M. Group M patients were earlier to reach adequate sedation level than those of group D, but they felt more pain either on local anesthetic injection or during operation. Rescue fentanyl was needed only for group M patients. Patient satisfaction was higher in group D. Time of surgery was longer in group M. Both groups were similar in sedation recovery and ward discharge times, as well as, incidence of side effects.
   Conclusion: Compared to midazolam sedation in SMES performed under local anesthesia, Dex-medetomedine was associated with a near bloodless microscopic surgical field, shorter surgery time, greater patient satisfaction, and lower pain scores with no adverse effects.

AB  - Middle ear packing agents are used in otologic surgery to provide support to the middle ear structures, maintain aeration of the middle ear, and promote hemostasis. However, there is currently a lack of standardization regarding the use of different types of packing agents. The choice of materials and how they are used remain controversial. In fact, some have recently advocated for no packing. In view of this, this review focuses on the types of materials available, a brief historical account of each material, characteristics of an ideal packing agent, and a discussion on the techniques of insertion to optimize surgical outcomes.

LA  - German
AB  - 28 tympanoplastic procedures with destruction and reconstruction of the ossicular chain were performed in rabbits. Vitreous carbon implants were used as prosthetic material. The animals were followed up from 14 days to one year. In 23 cases extensive inflammation of the middle ear mucosa was observed makroscopically. The histological findings were formation of an increasing fibrous capsule with duration of time, permanent foreign body reaction at the surface of the implants and missing  formation of new bone or contact with bone respectively. Thus vitreous carbon seems to be a less promising material in middle ear surgery.

TI  - LYOPHILIZED ALLOGENIC COSTAL CARTILAGE AS RECONSTRUCTION MATERIAL IN MIDDLE-EAR SURGERY
T2  - LARYNGO-RHINO-OTOLOGIE
LA  - German
AB  - From 1.1. 1983 to 31.3. 1983 we used lyophilised allogenic costal cartilage as reconstruction material in middle ear surgery in 53 patients. Reconstructions of the posterior bony canal wall were performed in cholesteatoma surgery in 89% of the cases. Lyophilised cartilage was also used for the restoration of a traumatic defect in the posterior bony canal wall, for the reconstruction of an atretic ear and an old radical cavity, for closing of a bony defect in the roof of the mastoid, and shaping a cartilaginous columella, or modrolus. Lyophilised cartilage fulfills its function completely in 87% of the cases. 5 reconstructions of the posterior bony canal wall were moderately sunk in. The ears were however dry and free of an inflammation. Both the ear canal and the drum were easy to survey. In 2 cases of a recurrent cholesteatoma, the lyophilised cartilage was extensively destroyed. There were no problems, such as incompatibility, host-versus graft reaction, infection or distorsion of the cartilage. With regard to our results, we recommend lyophilised allogenic costal cartilage as reconstruction material in circumscribed defects of the bony ear canal and in bony defects of the skull base of the ear, if larger and thicker pieces of cartilage, as can obtained from the patient's ear, are necessary. On the other hand, the cartilaginous columella cannot be recommended, because the lyophilised cartilage is embedded in firm covering of connective tissue.

AB  - Background: We investigated the effects of the combined administration of nefopam, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and low dose remifentanil, on early postoperative pain and analgesic requirement.
   Methods: Fifty patients scheduled to undergo mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty were randomized to be given either nefopam 40 mg mixed with normal saline 100 ml (Group N) or an equal amount of normal saline (Group C) before anesthesia induction. Anesthesia was maintained with 5-6 vol% desflurane and remifentanil 0.05-0.15 mu g/kg/min during the surgery. Postoperative pain was controlled by titration of ketorolac in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and ward. We evaluated the intraoperative remifentanil dose, recovery profiles, ketorolac demand in the PACU and ward, numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain at time intervals of every 10 min for 1 h in the PACU, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h in a ward, as well as the time to first analgesic requirement in the PACU and ward.
   Results: Ketorolac demand and NRS in the PACU were significantly lower in Group N than Group C (P = 0.002, P = 0.005, respectively). The time to first analgesic requirement in the PACU in Group N were significantly longer than Group C (P = 0.046). There were no significant differences in intraoperative remifentanil dose, ketorolac demand, NRS, and the time to first analgesic requirement in the ward between the groups.
   Conclusions: Nefopam administration combined with low dose remifentanil infusion reduces pain and analgesic consumption during the immediate postoperative period in patients undergoing middle ear surgery under desflurane anesthesia.

AB  - The current study aimed to investigate the middle ear structure and surgical approach appropriate for middle ear surgery in rabbits. A total of eight healthy New Zealand rabbits (16 ears) were dissected under a surgical microscope. The dimensions of the auditory canal and the middle ear were measured. In the present study, the transcanal surgical approach to the middle ear in rabbits was performed without complications, the anatomical landmarks in the auricle and the external auditory canal were apparent, no large vessels were present in the surgical zone and the bleeding was minor. Furthermore, the surgical procedure did not require removal of large bone sections of the external auditory canal. Additionally, the constitution of the ossicular chain, the leverage ratio of the ossicular chain and the constitution of ligaments and muscles in rabbits were similar to humans. Otherwise, the facial nerve canal in rabbits was more prominent compared with humans and the mobility of pars flaccida in rabbits was more noticeable compared with humans. The results of the current study indicate that the transcanal surgical approach was suitable to study the middle ear in rabbits. Furthermore, the rabbit middle ear may be used as a model for ossicular surgery and facial nerve research.

AB  - Cultured allogeneic ear keratinocyte sheets were used to treat 26 ears presenting with long-standing (average 37 months) chronic otorrhea, resistant to regular treatment, long after surgery for atresia (n = 8), cholesteatoma (n = 10), and chronic otitis media (n = 8). Complete epithelial healing and cessation of otorrhea were obtained in 18 cases (69%), following an average of 2.2 weekly applications. Temporary epithelial healing lasting at least 3 months was observed in 3 patients (12%) subsequently needing repeated applications. Lack of complete epithelialization was documented in 5 cases (19%). In 3 of those 5 cases, a reason could be determined. The authors speculate that the allocultured keratinocytes are able to promote migration and proliferation of resident cells at the wound edges, despite their short survival time, by release of keratinocyte-stimulating factors.

AB  - Conclusion. The improved biocompatibility of Bioveri((R)) II coated with a nanostructured surface shows promising qualities for use in human reconstructive middle ear surgery. In the case of chitosan-hydroxyapatite composite prostheses, further investigations regarding composition of the material, degree of purity and design are necessary before clinical application. Objective. The selection of optimal materials for reconstructive middle ear surgery continues to be a problem. In the present study novel materials were tested as total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORPs) in an animal model. Materials and methods. Bioverit((R)) 11 coated with a nanostructured surface and chitosan-hydroxyapatite composites were placed in the middle ear of 40 rabbits. Uncoated Bioveri((R)) II was used as control. After an implantation period of 28, 84 or 300 days petrous bones were extracted, embedded in epoxy resin and examined by light microscopy. Results. Uncoated and coated Bioverit((R)) prostheses revealed a mucosal coverage and a little osseogenic response after 28 days. The results of the coated Bioverit((R)) prostheses slightly surpassed those of the plain prostheses. Chitosan-hydroxyapatite composite prostheses were mostly found to be dislocated after 28 days. Formations of granulation tissue and fibrotic capsules were observed around these implants. This reaction could be caused by the instability of the composite material or may be due to impurities present in the chitosan.

AB  - Background: Positive airway pressure (PAP) devices are used as treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). PAP may increase middle ear pressure which is of interest to otologic surgeons. There is a lack of data to guide management of PAP therapy after middle ear surgery.
   Objective: To elucidate how otologic surgeons manage PAP in their patients after ear surgery.
   Study Design: A survey e-mailed to practicing members of the American Neurotology Society.
   Results: Among 60 respondents, the most common recommendations to patients were to avoid PAP use for 1 week (40%), return to normal use immediately (23.3%), avoid PAP for 1 month (13.3%), or avoid PAP for 1 day (13.3%) after surgery. Twenty percent of providers reported that they change their advice on the basis of the PAP pressure settings (i.e., shorter hiatus for higher settings). Among respondents, 47% think that they have patients with middle ear issues because of PAP and 13% attributed surgical failures to PAP use. One-third of providers routinely pack the Eustachian tube during surgery. Providers who attributed a negative surgical outcome to PAP use were more likely to routinely pack/plug the Eustachian tube during otologic surgery (p = 0.001).
   Conclusion: Treatment recommendations regarding postoperative PAP treatment for obstructive sleep apnea vary greatly among practicing otologists. Providers who think that an adverse outcome was attributed to PAP use were more likely to prophylactically plug the Eustachian tube during surgery. Future research will provide additional information which will allow a better understanding of the effect of PAP on the middle ear, especially after otologic surgery.

AB  - Objective: Middle ear surgery involves reconstruction of the ossicular chain, predominately using rigid implants. New middle ear prostheses strive to mimic the physiologic micromovements of the ossicular chain and prevent dislocation, protrusion, and preloading of the annular ligament due to pressure fluctuations.Methods: Thirty-five patients were included in a monocentric, prospective observational study. Patients received tympanoplasty with ossicular reconstruction using the mCLIP ARC partial prosthesis. This titanium prosthesis is equipped with a clip mechanism for coupling at the stapes and a ball joint connecting headplate and shaft. At short-term (ST) and mid-term (MT) follow-up, pure-tone audiometry was performed and the pure tone average of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz (PTA4) was calculated. The audiological outcome was compared with retrospective data of the Dresden titanium clip prosthesis.Results: The new prosthesis shows favorable clinical results. Pure-tone audiometry showed satisfactory results in ST and MT follow-up, with the PTA4 air-bone gap (ABG) decreasing from 24.5 (+/- 11) dB to 17.4 (+/- 7.9) dB at the ST follow-up at 27 days to 15.6 (+/- 10.3) dB at MT follow-up at 196 days (n = 32). A PTA4-ABG value of less than 20 dB was achieved by 63% of patients at ST follow-up and by 77% at MT follow-up. There was no significant difference in PTA4 ABG compared to the Dresden titanium clip prosthesis during ST follow-up (p = 0.18).Conclusion: The mCLIP ARC partial prosthesis, a new middle ear prosthesis with a balanced ball joint, shows promising audiological results and is a safe and effective choice for patients with chronic ear disease.

AB  - A study of the space available for an ossicular prosthesis [in man] was presented. Temporal bones (12) without any signs of chronic ear disease were used. The measurements were made with the bone free from soft tissue mounted on a microscope cross-table. The different distances were recorded by a stereomicroscope. The width between the facial nerve canal and the promontory was 2.2 mm. The distance from the footplate to the tympanic sulcus plane was 6.6 mm. The space available for the head of a prosthesis was also investigated.

KW  - ANATOMY
AB  - Objective: Endoscopic procedures are becoming common in middle ear surgery. Inflammation due to chronic ear disease can cause bony erosion of the carotid artery and Fallopian canals, making them more vulnerable during surgery. The objective of this study was to determine whether or not chronic ear disease increases dehiscence of the carotid artery and Fallopian canals.
   Design: Comparative human temporal bone study.
   Setting: Otopathology laboratory.
   Participants: We selected 78 temporal bones from 55 deceased donors with chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma and then compared those two groups with a control group of 27 temporal bones from 19 deceased donors with no middle ear disease.
   Main outcome measures: We analysed the middle ear, carotid artery canal and Fallopian canal, looking for signs of dehiscence of its bony coverage, using light microscopy.
   Results: We found an increased incidence in dehiscence of the carotid artery and Fallopian canals in temporal bones with chronic middle ear disease. The size of the carotid artery canal dehiscence was larger in the middle ear-diseased groups, and its bony coverage, when present, was also thinner compared to the control group. Dehiscence of the carotid artery canal was more frequently located closer to the promontory. The incidence of Fallopian canal dehiscence was significantly higher in temporal bones from donors older than 18 years with chronic middle ear disease.
   Conclusion: The increased incidence of the carotid artery and Fallopian canal dehiscence in temporal bones with chronic middle ear disease elevates the risk of adverse events during middle ear surgery.

AB  - Objectives: We aimed to clarify the postoperative morphology of the fungiform papillae (FP) of the tongue in patients who recovered gustatory function after the chorda tympani nerve was severed during middle ear surgery.
   Methods: Fifty-four patients with normal preoperative gustatory function measured by electrogustometry (EGM) were included. The proximal and distal stumps of the severed nerves were re-adapted or re-approximated during surgery to promote regeneration of the nerve. The EGM thresholds over 2 years after surgery were compared with preoperative values. At the same time, the morphological characteristics of the FP in the midlateral region of the tongue were recorded with a digital microscope.
   Results: One month after surgery, EGM showed no response in any patients. At a time point of more than 2 years, the FP showed complete atrophy and no response to EGM on the surgical side in 21 of the 54 patients. In 16 patients who showed complete recovery of the EGM threshold (below 20 mu A), the FP showed an almost normal appearance, and the mean number of FP was 77.5% (10 +/- 4.1 papillae per square centimeter) of that on the contralateral side (12.9 +/- 4.9 papillae per square centimeter; p>0.05).
   Conclusions: The morphology of the FP was maintained in patients who recovered gustatory function after the chorda tympani nerve was severed. Because the results indicate regeneration of the taste buds, further observation is needed to detect regenerated taste buds in the FP.

AB  - The Eustachian tube is normally closed, but it opens upon swallowing for only less than one second to equalize the middle ear pressure with the atmospheric pressure, and immediately closes again. Patients with patulous Eustachian tube (PET) suffer from annoying symptoms, such as aural fullness (sensation of fullness in the ear), autophonia (abnormally loud audition of own voice), audition of breathing sound, and fluctuating sensation of the tympanic membrane upon respiration. The diagnosis of PET is not difficult when patients complain of such typical symptoms. However, there is an unexpected pitfall, in which the symptoms of PET are masked by the presence of conductive hearing loss and obvious middle ear pathology. Here, we propose that this condition be termed 'masked patulous Eustachian tube' to promote correct diagnosis prior to planning the middle ear surgery. Four representative patients with 'masked patulous Eustachian tube' are presented: two exhibited symptoms after repair of chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane, one after stapes surgery for otosclerosis, and one after cholesteatoma surgery. In these patients, the symptoms of PET became evident only after surgery due to the improvement of hearing. The degree of hearing improvement varied among the patients from 15 to 40 dB in average hearing level. It is therefore important to examine the presence of 'masked patulous Eustachian tube', in addition to a middle ear disease for which surgery is planned. The surgeon should inform the patient of the possibility of I masked patulous Eustachian tube' to avoid the postoperative disappointment.

AB  - The last 30 years has seen a gradual change in the management of otosclerosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the current practice among British otolaryngology consultants using a questionnaire, and to compare it with the practice reported in a survey 8 years ago. A total of 353 valid responses (64.5%) were available for analysis. The overall trend is towards centralization, with a reduction in the number of surgeons undertaking stapes surgery (49.9%). The majority of consultants (81.3%) who undertake stapes surgery would operate for a unilateral conductive loss and 75.1% would undertake bilateral stapes surgery. Stapedotomy is the operation of choice (82%), with a few consultants performing partial or rarely total stapedectomies. Postoperative restrictions and follow-up times vary widely amongst surgeons, with the senior surgeons tending to be more conservative than the younger consultants.

AB  - Introduction Middle ear surgeries, including myringoplasty, have increasingly utilized endoscopes as an adjunct to or as a replacement for the operative microscope. Objectives The objective of the present study was to evaluate the graft uptake rate and to evaluate the hearing results. Methods This is a prospective study. We have analyzed 139 patients who underwent surgery for chronic otitis media (COM) of the mucosal type. All of the surgeries were performed exclusively under total endoscopic transcanal approach using tragal cartilage as graft, underlay technique. We have evaluated the postoperative graft uptake and performed a hearing evaluation at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks, and at 6 months. Results During the study period, 139 patients were included, out of which 13 were lost to follow-up; therefore, only 126 patients were assessed. All of the cases were performed under total endoscopic approach. As for the surgical outcome at the postoperative otoscopy, 3 cases had initial uptake at 3 months and failed later; therefore, complete closure of the perforation was observed in 97.6% ( n = 123) of the patients 6 months after the intervention. Four patients presented with preoperative anacusis; therefore, only 122 patients were included for hearing evaluation. The preoperative air conduction threshold (ACT) and airbone gap (ABG) were 43.34 +/- 11.53 and 24.73 +/- 7.89, respectively. Postoperatively, the ACT and ABG closure were 28.73 +/- 15.75 and 11.91 +/- 8.41, respectively. This difference was statistically significant ( p < 0.001). Conclusion The endoscopic approach for myringoplasty offers excellent visualization; avoids postaural approach, enables a faster recovery, requires less hospital stay, with excellent graft closure rate and improved functional outcomes.

KW  - LASER DOPPLER MEASUREMENTS
AB  - Objective-Because it is necessary to maintain controlled hypotension during middle ear surgery in order to avoid bleeding and as it is known that cochlear blood flow (CBF) is related to blood pressure (BP), it is useful to evaluate CBF modifications induced by anaesthetics in order to prevent cochlear damage. The aim of this paper is to evaluate, using laser Doppler flowmetry, which anaesthetic drug, out of sevoflurane and propofol, has the smallest effect on CBF.
   Material and Methods-Twenty consenting adult patients scheduled for myringoplasty under general anaesthesia for simple tympanic membrane perforation were studied. Patients were divided into two groups: the first group was treated with sevoflurane and the second with propofol. For the first group, CBF measurement was carried out on three different occasions: (i) at a basal low drug dosage; (ii) having increased the drug dosage to a higher level; and (iii) having reduced the drug dosage to the basal low level again. For the second group, CBF measurement was carried out on three different occasions: (i) 10 min after injecting a bolus of propofol; (ii) immediately after a second propofol injection; and (iii) 10 min after a third injection of propofol. A probe was placed over the promontory in order to measure CBF levels.
   Results-In the subjects treated with sevoflurane, after having increased the drug dosage, BP decreased significantly while CBF did not change significantly. In the subjects treated with propofol we recorded a significant reduction in BP, as well as a decrease in CBF.
   Conclusion-The results obtained show that sevoflurane has a hypotensive effect without modifying CBF, while propofol, although having a similar effect on BP to sevoflurane, has less of a protective effect on inner ear microcirculation.

AB  - Preservation of the chorda tympani is important in middle ear surgery to prevent dysgeusia postoperatively. However, determining the exact course of the chorda tympani before surgery is not always possible, especially in cases with accompanying malformations. In this report, we presented an extremely rare case of bifurcation of the chorda tympani in a 15-year-old male patient. We performed tympanoplasty for a middle ear malformation with conductive hearing loss During the operation, we noticed and carefully preserved the bifurcated chorda tympani.The patient did not develop dysgeusia postoperatively. Appropriate handling and understanding of the anomalous chorda tympani preserved the patient's sense of taste and hence quality of life.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) injury between endoscopic and microscopic stapes surgery. Methods This randomized controlled clinical trial included 88 patients who were randomly divided into two groups: endoscopic stapedotomy group (n = 44) and microscopic stapedotomy group (n = 44). The incidence of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) injury after surgery was determined by both subjective taste testing and chemical taste tests, before and after surgery. The results were compared between the two groups. Results The total number of patients who were identified as having CTN affection (based on the chemical testing) was 16 out of 88 (18.2%). The incidence was significantly lower in the endoscopic group (n = 2) than the microscopic group (n = 14) (p = 0.019). Conclusion Altered taste as a result of iatrogenic CTN injury can affect the patients' quality of life. Endoscopic ear surgery offers better visualization, less need for extensive manipulation of the chorda tympani, and consequently decreased incidence of CTN injury.

AB  - Introduction: Middle Ear Surgeries (MESs) are generally performed using local anaesthesia under sedation. Butorphanol and nalbuphine both are well-known synthetic opioid with agonist-antagonist characteristics. However, no reports present a direct comparison of the analgesic efficacy of these two drugs. Aim: To evaluate analgesic efficacy of intravenous butorphanol versus intravenous nalbuphine during Monitored Anaesthesia Care (MAC) in patients undergoing tympanoplasty. Materials and Methods: This randomised clinical trial was conducted at the Department of Anaesthesiology, School of Medicine, D.Y. Patil Deemed to be University, Mumbai, Maharashtra India, from March 2018 to March 2021. Total 112 adult patients, undergoing tympanoplasty, were randomly allocated into two groups. Group N received 0.2 mg/kg nalbuphine intravenous (i.v.) and group B received i.v. 0.02 mg/ kg butorphanol. The patients were then evaluated for analgesic efficacy, sedation, blood pressure, Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), Heart Rate (HR), Respiratory Rate (RR), blood oxygen levels (SpO(2)), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Score, need for intraoperative rescue sedation/analgesia, duration of action and side-effects. Results: A significant difference was observed in the patients' responses to needle prick, where only 8 (13.3%) subjects gave a vocal response in group N versus 22 (36.6%) in group B. A significant difference in the mean time of onset of pain amongst both the group was recorded (3.16 +/- 1.38 hrs in group N and 2.63 +/- 1.19 hrs in group B). A significant difference was also recorded in the mean VAS at 15th (p-value=0.012) and 30th min (p-value= 0.017). Only 7 patients (11.6%) from group N, and 12 patients (20%) from group B required rescue agent (0.5 mcg/kg/ hour dexmedetomidine injection and 75 mg diclofenac sodium injection intravenous). Conclusion: Both 0.2 mg/kg nalbuphine and 0.2 mg/kg butorphanolprovide satisfactory results in terms of analgesic efficacy, sedation, hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, albeit, nalbuphine can be coined to be superior in terms of response to pin prick and duration of action.

AB  - Background: During Middle Ear Surgeries (MES) done under Local Anesthesia (LA), patients may feel discomfort due to noise of suction, manipulation of instruments, positioning of head-neck and sometimes due to pain. A bloodless microscopic field is also essential to facilitate surgical exposure in MES. Various combinations of analgesics and sedatives have been tried to alleviate apprehension of the patients and improve microscopic field which may result into reduction in surgical time. In the present study, we have compared Dexmedetomedine (Dex) with Midazolam-Fentanyl (MF) and Pentazocine-Promethazine (PP) combinations for their sedoanalgcsia, anxiolysis and other pharmacological effects when administered during MES, not lasting for more than 60 min. Material and Methods: Ninety American Society of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) group I /II patients admitted in either of the three hospitals during May 2014 to January 2015 for MES under LA were randomly divided into three groups by an independent observer. Group D received intravenous bolus of Injection Dexmedetomidine 1 mu g/ kg over 10 min. Group MF received Injection Midazolam 0.06 mg/ kg + Inj. Fentanyl 1 mu g/ kg and Group PP received Injection Pentazocine 0.3 mg/kg + Injection Promethazine 0.5mg/kg given intravenously followed by LA before taking incision for the surgery. Need of a rescue sedoanalgesic dose of (Midazolam 0.01 mg/kg + Fentanyl 0.5 mu g/kg) during the surgery was noted. All the patients received 500 ml of normal saline infusion till the end of the surgery. All surgeries were finished within 60 min. Vital parameters and Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) of the patients were noted from the time of administration of sedative till the end of the surgery. Patient and surgeon satisfaction scores were recorded immediately after the surgery. Drug combinations of three groups were compared for their effectiveness, adverse effects and satisfaction scores in given doses. Children, mentally unstable patients, uncooperative patients, patients requesting general anesthesia, patients with known sensitivity to local anesthetic drug Lignocaine, and allergy to study drugs, pregnant and lactating females were excluded from the study. Results: RSS were satisfactory in Group D and Group MF but not in Group PP. Percentage of patients requiring rescue sedoanalgesic dose of (Midazolam 0.01 mg/kg + Fentanyl 0.5 mu g/kg) was the highest (20%) in Group PP. It was the least in Group D. Intraoperative heart rate and mean arterial pressure in Group D were significantly lower than the baseline values and the corresponding values in Group MF and Group PP. Incidence of postoperative nausea was higher in Group PP. One patient in Group D had significant bradycardia with hypotension while one patient in Group MF got desaturated needing Oxygen therapy. Statistically significant number of patients from Group D had bloodless microscopic field compared to Group MF and Group PP. Surgeon satisfaction scores which showed statistically significant correlation with type of microscopic field were better in Group D. Patient satisfaction scores were better in Group D than Group MF and Group PP. Conclusion: Out of the sedoanalgesics tested. Dexmedetomidine was found to be the best drug for MES patients performed under local anaesthesia. It produced near bloodless microscopic surgical field with better surgeon and patient satisfaction.

   Methods: We used the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) tool to ascertain patients' perceived experience.
   Results: The study demonstrated a positive health impact following endoscopic stapling of the Zenker's diverticulum. The mean total GBI score was +18.9 (95% confidence interval, +/- 11.2). The impact of endoscopic stapling was positive for all three subsets of the GBI. The GBI scores were comparable to those obtained after other common otorhinolaryngo-logical procedures such as tonsillectomy, rhinoplasty, and middle ear surgery.
   Conclusions: These data should improve our ability to counsel patients regarding important therapeutic decisions and expectations of surgical outcome.

AB  - Introduction: Endoscopic-assisted microsurgery of the middle ear enables the field of view of the surgeon to be expanded during the removal of inflammatory tissue from the tympanic cavity and during myringo- and ossiculoplasty. Canal wall up tympanoplasty with posterior tympanotomy is a gold standard in surgical treatment of chronic otitis media. Most applications of endoscopy in middle ear surgery concern exclusively the endoscopic transcanal approach.
   Aim: To determine the usefulness of endoscopic visualization during the standard surgical approach through the posterior tympanotomy.
   Material and methods: The study compared the visualization of the elements of the middle ear through the posterior tympanotomy by endoscopes with 30 degrees and 45 degrees optics and a microscope. Posterior tympanotomy was performed in eleven temporal bones. Visualization of the tympanic recesses was assessed on a subjective scale. A microscope and 30 degrees and 45 degrees endoscopes were used for inspection of the hypotympanum, sinus tympani, Eustachian tube, Prussak's space and footplate. Friedman ANOVA test and Dunn's multiple comparisons test were used for statistical analysis of the data.
   Results: Visualization of particular recesses by endoscopes, both 30 degrees and 45 degrees, was excellent, while the microscopic view was statistically significantly worse, especially for sinus tympani, Prussak's space and footplate. There were no significant differences in visibility of the middle ear spaces between the two types of endoscopic optics.
   Conclusions: Additional application of the endoscopes during middle ear surgery provides valuable information due to excellent visualization of key recesses usually hidden from the microscope.

AB  - BackgroundThe chorda tympani nerve (CTN) is a mixed nerve, which carries sensory and parasympathetic fibres. The sensory component supplies the taste sensation of the anterior two-thirds of the ipsilateral side of the tongue. During middle ear surgery the CTN is exposed and frequently stretched or sacrificed, because it lacks a bony covering as it passes through the middle ear. Injury may cause hypogeusia, ageusia or altered taste sensation of the ipsilateral side of the tongue. To date, there is no consensus regarding which type of CTN injury (sacrificing or stretching), during middle ear surgery, leads to the least burden for the patient. MethodsA double-blind prospective prognostic association study was designed in a single medical centre in the Netherlands to determine the effect of CTN injury on postoperative taste disturbance and quality of life. 154 patients, who will undergo primary stapes surgery or cochlear implantation will be included. The taste sensation, food preferences and quality of life of these patients will be evaluated preoperatively and at one week, six weeks and six months postoperatively using the Taste Strip Test, Electrogustometry, supplementary questionnaire on taste disturbance, Macronutrient and Taste Preference Ranking Task, Appetite, Hunger and Sensory Perception questionnaire and Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders to assess the association of these outcomes with CTN injury. Evaluation of olfactory function will only take place preoperatively and at one week postoperatively using the Sniffin' Sticks. The patient and outcome assessor are blinded to the presence or absence of CTN injury. DiscussionThis study is the first to validate and quantify the effect of chorda tympani nerve injury on taste function. The findings of this study may lead to evidence-based proof of the effect of chorda tympani injury on taste function with consequences for surgical strategies.

AB  - Objectives: Despite the worldwide availability of endoscope in otology, it still has not replaced the microscopic surgery as it has for nose surgery. In 2008, we administered a questionnaire on the preference of using otoscopes in Korea. In light of the worldwide availability of endoscopic ear surgery, we have now conducted a more detailed survey to determine if this preference has changed over 8 years.& para;& para;Subjects and methods: A questionnaire consisting of 10 questions was used to survey members of the Korean Oto-logical Society who were actively performing middle ear surgery. The responses to this questionnaire were compared to those from 2008. The study also determined the preference for endoscope use based on the surgeon's experience.& para;& para;Results: The mean surgical experience of the otologists was 12.7 years. Endoscopy for tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy increased over a period of 8 years. In the outpatient clinic, the use of endoscopy also increased ; over 8-year period, it surpassed the microscope as the most preferred diagnostic tool in the outpatient clinic. Greater than half of the operating rooms were equipped with endoscopic sets; however, only 4.5% of otologists acknowledged having endoscopic instruments.& para;& para;Conclusion: Endoscopy for surgery and in outpatient clinic assessment increased in otology in Korea; however, endoscopes have consistently been used as an adjuvant to the microscope to improve visualization of the tympanic cavity rather than as a tool for totally endoscopic ear surgery.

AB  - Objective: This meta-analysis compares the efficacy and safety of endoscopic and microscopic approaches to tympanoplasty and stapes surgery, two common middle ear procedures. Data Sources: A comprehensive electronic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted for studies published from the year 1960 through June 2018. Article selection and screening proceeded according to the strategies outlined in the standard Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis statement. Methods: Studies were assessed for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Jadad scale depending on the presence of randomization. Bias was analyzed using funnel plots. For each outcome measure, a forest plot was generated and a pooled relative risk or risk difference was calculated to assess significance. Results: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, 16 tympanoplasty (1,323 ears) and 5 stapes surgery (283 ears). The nonrandomized studies scored moderately well but the randomized studies were of low quality with respect to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Jadad Scale, respectively. With respect to tympanoplasty, statistical analysis demonstrated that the endoscopic approach had significantly lower canalplasty rates, better cosmetic outcomes, and shorter operative times. Furthermore, endoscopic compared to microscopic methods were similar in terms of audiological outcome, graft success rate, and complication rate. Among stapes surgeries, the endoscopic approach demonstrated a significantly decreased incidence of postoperative pain and chorda tympani injury but was similar to the microscopic approach with respect to audiological outcome, postoperative dizziness, and operative time. Conclusions: Though the merits of endoscopic techniques are becoming more well known, there are still concerns regarding their efficacy and safety. An analysis of the current literature suggests that audiological, functional, and safety outcomes are similar, if not superior, for the endoscopic approach to both tympanoplasty and stapes surgery compared to the microscopic approach. With respect to tympanoplasty, patients undergoing the endoscopic approach had lower canalplasty rates, better cosmetic outcomes, and shorter operative times. Among stapes surgeries, patients in the endoscopic group had a lower incidence of postoperative pain and injury to the chorda tympani. This meta-analysis of the current evidence supports the use of endoscopic techniques for tympanoplasty and stapes surgery.

AB  - Introduction: Tymanoplasty, a middle ear surgery, is done either under Local Anaesthesia (LA), General Anaesthesia (GA) or sedation with local anaesthesia. It is usually performed under Monitored Anesthesia Care (MAC) providing advantages of rapid onset, allowing hearing test intraoperatively and early mobilisation of the patient.
   Aim: To study the effect of nalbuphine/dexmedetomidine with nalbuphine/propofol on sedation and analgesia in tympanoplasties performed under MAC.
   Materials and Methods: This randomised, double-blind, clinical study was conducted from June 2020 to June 2021 in the Department of Anaesthesiology at Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College and MY Hospital, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India. Total 60 adult patients, of American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I and II undergoing tympanoplasty under MAC, were randomly allocated into two groups. All patients received injection nalbuphine 50 mu g/kg intravenously. Group D received a bolus dose of injection dexmedetomidine 1 mu g/kg i.v. over 10 min followed by an infusion at 0.3 mu g/kg/h i.v. Group P received a bolus dose of injection propofol 0.75 mg/kg followed by an infusion at 0.025 mg/kg/min i.v. Sedation and analgesia were titrated to Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of 3 each. The vital parameters and need for intraoperative rescue sedation/analgesia were recorded and compared.
   Results: Mean RSS was significantly more in group D (3.11 +/- 0.055) than group P (2.80 +/- 0.350). Overall, VAS score was significantly less in group D (1.60 +/- 0.670) than group P (2.70 +/- 0.691). In group D, 2 (6%) patients and in group P, 4 (12%) patients required inj. midazolam. Similarly, the requirement of inj. paracetamol in group D was in 3 (10%) patients, and in Group P it was 10 (33%) patients. Bradycardia (23.3% in group D and 13.3% in group P) and hypotension (20% in group D and 13.3% in group P) were the major side-effects seen in the study.
   Conclusion: Nalbuphine/dexmedetomidine is superior to nalbuphine/propofol in producing sedation and decreasing VAS in patients undergoing tympanoplasty under MAC.

AB  - The inception of medial grafting as a technique for tympanic membrane repair was a critical milestone in the history of otology. John Shea introduced the medial graft technique and the use of vein grafts for tympanoplasty in 1960 after realizing that the vein grafts that he used to repair the oval window after stapedectomy could also be utilized to repair tympanic membrane perforations. At the time, tympanoplasty often utilized skin grafts, which required placement of the graft lateral to the tympanic membrane annulus. Placement of the graft medial to the tympanic membrane annulus allowed for more efficient surgery and avoided the complications associated with lateral grafting, such as blunting and lateralization. The introduction of vein grafts in tympanoplasty prompted a fundamental shift in technique from lateral to medial grafting, paving the way for decades of innovation in tympanoplasty.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewTo review contemporary literature on audiometric and functional outcomes of endoscopic ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR) and to contrast this with outcomes using traditional microscopic OCR.Recent FindingsAudiometric outcomes of endoscopic OCR (including benchmark outcome of percentage of cases with air-bone gap (ABG) closure to <20 dB) are similar compared with the traditional microscopic approach for ossiculoplasty. There are no significant differences in operative time or outcomes of primary versus staged ossiculoplasty.SummaryEndoscopic ossiculoplasty appears to be non-inferior to traditional microscopic approach in terms of audiometric success. Based on available data, perioperative complications and need for revision surgery are infrequent.

AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate hearing thresholds in 38 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, divided according to disease activity into active (group A, n = 20) and non-active (group B, n = 18) patients. Pure tone audiometry, tympanometry and complete rheumatological assessment were performed. All patients presented poorer auditory thresholds compared with controls. Patients of group A had both air and bone conduction thresholds poorer than group B (although not statistically significant), and most patients of both groups presented an air-bone (a-b) gap. No significant difference in middle ear pressure was noticed between patients and controls. No correlation between hearing impairment and duration of the disease or patients' age was found. The high prevalence of hearing loss in autoimmune diseases supports the importance of audiometric evaluation in such patients. The auditory recovery through middle ear surgery before cranial nerve involvement could be considered in selected patients. Further investigations are needed for a better knowledge of the middle and inner ear involvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

AB  - Objective: The choice of the graft in ossicular chain reconstruction during middle ear surgery for cholesteatoma is a subject still discussed on. In order to clarify the discussion of reuse of the autologous ossicles obtained during middle ear surgery for cholesteatoma. we evaluated the probability of residual disease histologically and the safety of the ossicles after autoclavization, the most promoting alternative method to eradicate residual cholesteatoma and infection on them. Methods: The specimens used in this study were eroded twenty-seven ossicles (22 incuses, 5 malleoli) which were removed from the 27 consecutive patients operated because of cholesteatomato us middle ear disease. They were grouped as follows: Group 1, Fifteen ossicles examined histopathologically directly. Group 2, Five ossicles autoclaved for 20 min at 134 C and then examined histopathologically. Group 3, Five ossicles autoclaved for 20 min at 134 C after mechanical surface cleaning by a fine diamond drill, examined histopathologically. Group 4, Two ossicles removed from two different patients were placed in their mastoid cavities in order to be examined after access in the second-look operation. While one ossicle was only autoclaved, the other was mechanically cleaned by a drill before autoclavization (for 20 min at 134 C). The ossicles were examined histopathologically after the removal at the second stage operation performed 12 months later. Results: In Group 1, all ossicles showed evidence of periosteal thickening. Additional findings were surface cholesteatoma or epithelia in 13 ossicles, surface inflammation in 12 ossicles, granulation tissue in 10 ossicles, osteitis in six ossicles. In Group 2, all five ossicles had preserved their lamellar structure but, no vital cells were seen. The lacunes that had the osteocytes was almost completely empty. The inflammatory cells were eliminated from the ossicles. In Group 3, ossicles were found well preserved with their lamellar structures and contours, with empty lacunes and eliminated inflammatory cells. In Group 4, in two ossicles of this group the lacunes were replaced by the new migrated viable osteocytes with evidence of new bone formation and neovascularisation. No new inflammatory focus or epithelia were found on the surfaces of the ossicles. The shape and the contour of the ossicles remained unchanged. Conclusion: In cholesteatoma surgery, ossicles with minimal erosion and adequate thickness can be used after autoclavization. In this study, it was observed histopathologically that the autoclaving autologous ossicles before ossiculoplasty in cholesteatomatous middle ear is a safe and reliable method.

Fifteen per cent of the patients needed cavity cleaning every six months, 25 per cent of them needed cavity cleaning every year and 60 per cent of the patients had a self-cleaning cavity. Only one patient with a cleft palate experienced cholesteatoma recurrence in the mesotympanum.Conclusion The half canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy technique showed a low-recurrence rate and satisfying operative cavities. The half canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy technique is a good choice for middle ear surgery.

AB  - The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the relation between audiometric and psychometric measures after tympanoplasty from the perspective of preoperative selection of patients and postoperative assessment of the results of reconstructive middle ear surgery. Hearing (dis)ability was measured by means of pure-tone audiometry and a validated self-assessment questionnaire: the (modified) Amsterdam Inventory of Auditory Disability and Handicap (m)AIAD. Average hearing thresholds and (m)AIAD scores were evaluated for 80 patients, pre- and 12 months postoperatively. The average improvement of the air conduction threshold in the operated ear was 5.4 ( +/- 14.3) dB; the average improvement in the (m)AIAD score was 2.9 points (+/- 12.1). Although not very strong, the audiometric improvement and increase in (m)AIAD score are significantly related. After the calculation of postoperatively measured mean scores on the (m)AIAD for different 10-dB intervals of postoperative hearing loss averaged over both ears, an interesting relation between the (m)AIAD score and hearing losses emerges. The (m)AIAD score is almost independent of hearing loss for postoperative hearing levels between 25 and 40 dB. Residual hearing loss has to become less than 25 dB before a smaller hearing loss corresponds with a higher (better) (m)AIAD score. For losses larger than 40 dB the (m)AIAD score clearly decreases with increasing hearing loss. Finally, even small residual hearing losses lead, on average, to (m)AIAD scores that are substantially lower than the score for normally hearing subjects. In general, the patient benefit seems related to the magnitude of improvement in the air-conduction thresholds, rather than to the achievement of a certain threshold level. In addition, even small residual hearing losses (less than 25 dB HL) still lead, on average, to (m)AIAD scores that are substantially lower than the scores for normally hearing subjects.

AB  - Objective: For the last 20 years, transcanal endoscopic ear surgery has emerged as a viable, ergonomic, and powerful alternative surgical modality of choice replacing the conventional microscopic approach in many ways. This study compares the functional and anatomical outcomes of endoscopic tympanoplasty with microscopic tympanoplasty using full-thickness tragal cartilage as a graft of choice. Methodology: This observational, analytical, retrospective study was conducted in the department of Otolaryngology in a tertiary care hospital over two years. It included an analysis of medical records of 38 patients (above 10 years of age), who underwent conventional microscopic and transcanal endoscopic tympanoplasty (type I) for dry and small/medium size tympanic perforations. Morphological and functional outcomes were compared in both groups by noting the condition of graft and air-bone gap on follow-up. Result: There were 19 patients each in both groups. The mean pre-and post-operative ABG in each group was comparable and the difference was statistically significant in each group ( P< 0.05). Comparing the mean ABG change between both groups, there was a statistically significant difference noted (P<0.05). The success rate was found to be 89.5% (17 /19) in the endoscopic surgery group and 94.7% (18/19) in the microscopic surgery group. The difference in the anatomical success of both groups was not statistically significant. Conclusion: There was no statistically significant difference between both groups regarding graft take-up rates but functionally hearing outcomes were better in the MES group which was statistically significant.

AB  - The effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients. Twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane (hypotensive group). Seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control group. The mean arterial pressure was 77+/-2 mmHg (10.3+/-0.3 kPa) before hypotension and 50+/-0 mmHg (6.7+/-0.0 kPa) during hypotension in the hypotensive group, and 86+/-2 mmHg (11.5+/-0.3 kPa) during anaesthesia in the control group. The following psychological tests were performed: four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (similarities, digit span, vocabulary and digit symbol), Trail-Making tests A and B, Zung tests (self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale) a.d two-part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall. The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value. The results indicate that hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia.

AB  - Background: A significant number of adults suffer from conductive hearing loss due to chronic otitis media, otosclerosis, or other pathologies. An objective measurement of ossicular mobility is needed to avoid unnecessarily invasive middle ear surgery and to improve hearing outcomes.
   Methods: Minimally invasive intraoperative laser vibrometry provides a method that is compatible with middle ear surgery, where the tympanic membrane is elevated. The ossicles were driven by a floating mass transducer and their mobility was measured using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Utilising this method, we assessed both the absolute velocities of the umbo and incus long process as well as the incus-to-umbo velocity ratio during artificial fixation of the incus alone or incus and malleus together.
   Results: The reduction of absolute velocities was 8 dB greater at the umbo and 17 dB at the incus long process for incus-malleus fixations when compared with incus fixation alone. Incus fixation alone resulted in no change to the incus-to-umbo velocity ratio where incus-malleus fixations reduced this ratio (-11 dB). The change in incus velocity was shown to be the most suitable parameter to distinguish between incus fixation and incus-malleus fixation. When the whole frequency range was analyzed, one could also differentiate these two fixations from previously published stapes fixation, where the higher frequencies were less affected.
   Conclusion: Minimally invasive intraoperative laser vibrometry provides a promising objective analysis of ossicular mobility that would be useful intraoperatively.

AB  - Biomaterials are a necessity in modern otosurgery, but none is usefull for all applications. Surface properties, particularly structural characteristics, critically influence the quality of the implant-biological interface. Micropores promote fixation whereas polished surfaces tend to resist it. Prior to the introduction of any new biomaterials, safety precautions must be adhered to rigorously. We showed that osteoblast-like cells grew from human stapedes. This model detected cytotoxicity but it did not show difference in growth when several biomaterials were compared. Hence, animal studies are necessary to evaluate the complicated interactions of mucosa, bone, ventilation and possibly infection with respect to the placement of middle ear prostheses. Nevertheless, animal study results must be interpreted cautiously. In the future therefore, it is clear that rigorously controlled pilot introduction in humans will be required after the biomaterial has passed detailed in-vitro and in-vivo experimental test examinations. The use of plastics often leads to foreign body reaction in the middle ear. Teflon used in stapes prostheses as the only exception, has proved valuable as a result of its low surface energy, and consequently, the avoidance of prosthetic epithelialisation. Most ceramics are biocompatible, but glasses are degradable and therefore of no use in potentially infected ears. Titanium and gold are playing an increasingly important role. However, it should be noted that gold may cause damage to the inner ear, when used as stapes prosthesis. The use of ionomeric cement resulted in fatal complications, when it came in contact with cerebrospinal fluid and consequently, the use of this material has been completely abandoned.

AB  - This review gives a survey of biomaterials used for ossicular chain reconstruction. The survey is focussed on application, biophysical requirements, properties and goals for future developments. The implantation site middle ear differs from others due to aeration and potential bacterial colonization. As a consequence, implant materials must exhibit excellent biocompatibility, biostabilty and sound conducting properties. In vitro and in vivo biocompatibility investigations and clinical observations determine the choice of material. Additionally the implants must provide the possibilty of intraoperative shaping or should be available in different variations in order to allow reconstruction appropriate to the individual conditions. Ceramics, metals and plastics are materials in current use. Based on thorough experimental and long term clinical experiences, the bioinert aluminum oxide is favorable amoung the ceramics. Bioactive ceramics may have minor biostability and the risk of fixation to surrounding bone which impairs sound conduction. This is also true for hydroxyapatite although biodegradation occurs only rarely. Today, titanium is the metal best established in middle ear implantation, reflected by excellent biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo, and good clinical results. Titanium is preferred by many surgeons, considering that sound transmission properties are mainly dependent on the implant weight. In stapes surgery, when the implant has direct contact to inner fluids, gold was accused to cause granuloma formation with subsequent inner ear damage in selected cases. In frequent past and present use, plastics (porous polyethylene and teflon) have proven to be of limited value in ossicular chain replacement because of high extrusion rates and the observation of material desintegration and bacterial colonization. In order to individually manage the pathological conditions in the middle ear, the implant design is of crucial importance. It is dependent on the ossicle to be replaced and the implant material. Future investigations have to minimize implant extrusions possibly by modifying and improving implant surfaces.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the clinical features of labyrinthine fistulae occurring as a late complication of middle ear surgery using the canal wall down technique.
   Study Design: This,was a retrospective study of the past 23 years, conducted at a single tertiary care center. The authors evaluated the backgrounds, clinical features, and surgical findings in 25 patients with labyrinthine fistulae, who had a history of ear surgery using the canal down technique and who underwent a second operation at their hospital.
   Interventions: All the patients underwent revision surgery because of persistent or recurrent vertigo caused by labyrinthine fistulae, circumscribed labyrinthitis, or suppurative labyrinthitis.
   Main Outcome Measures: The clinical features of this disease entity were assessed by history, surgical findings, and the results of audiovestibular testing.
   Results : The patients had a long history of repetitive postoperative aural discharge before experiencing vertigo, which initially occurred 4 to 64 years (average, 20.2 years) after the previous operation. At the first visit to the authors' clinic, the results of a fistula test conducted with a Politzer's bulb were positive in 14 patients and negative in 5 patients. In the remaining 6 ears, pressure loading of the ear canal induced the sensation of vertigo without accompanying nystagmus. Surgical intervention showed that the fistulae were located at the lateral semicircular canal in 19 ears, at the footplate of the stapes in 4 ears, and at the promontory in 2 ears. Labyrinthine fistulae were closed with conchal cartilage, bone paste (bone dust mixed with fibrin glue), and/or temporalis fascia. In some patients, the fistulae were further covered with pedicled temporalis muscle. In 2 cases complicated by acute suppurative labyrinthitis, the mastoid cavity was obliterated after completion of the labyrinthectomy. The postoperative courses in all patients were uneventful.
   Conclusions: A labyrinthine fistula may be created by repeated and insidious infection of a mastoid cavity that has been exposed to the outside during canal wall down surgery. Intensive care of the opened mastoid cavity is essential to avoid this late complication.

AB  - Cholesteatoma is a potentially serious complication of chronic ear infections and requires surgical intervention for definitive management. Long-term complications include a frequent need for repeat surgical intervention for disease recurrence, and techniques to improve efficacy of single-stage surgery are an important area of continued research. This study investigates a novel application of the photosensitizer immune conjugate (PIC) cetuximab-benzoporphyrin derivative (Cet-BPD) for in vitro localization of human cholesteatoma tissue, coupled with an in vivo safety study for middle ear application of Cet-BPD in a murine model. In fresh human cholesteatoma tissues, Cet-BPD demonstrates selective localization to the hyperplastic squamous cell tissue associated with cholesteatoma, without localizing to other tissues such as middle ear mucosa. Applied to the murine middle ear, Cet-BPD does not demonstrate any deleterious effect on murine hearing when assessed by any of auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds, distortion product otoacoustic emission thresholds, or ABR wave I amplitudes. These findings demonstrate the technical promise and encouraging safety profile for the use of PICs for intraoperative localization and treatment of cholesteatoma.

   Summary: Microtia reconstruction is both challenging and controversial. Our understanding of the epidemiology and genetics of microtia is improving. Surgical techniques continue to evolve, with better results. Treatment selection continues to be controversial. There are strong proponents for reconstruction with costal cartilage, Medpor or a prosthesis. More realistic models for teaching surgeons how to do the procedures are becoming available. Our approach to hearing rehabilitation is changing. Better solutions using percutaneous and implantable devices are under evaluation to help both unilateral and bilateral microtia patients. Tissue engineering will offer some exciting new treatment possibilities in the future.

AB  - Middle ear neuroendocrine tumors (MeNETs) are an exceptionally rare occurrence. These benign tumors stem from the tympanic mucosa and can easily be misinterpreted by the clinician and the pathologist. Clinical characteristics, otoscopic findings and medical imaging in these cases are non-specific. We present a case of a 60-year-old male patient with bilateral hearing loss following recent coronavirus disease 2019 disease. Diagnostic work-up revealed a soft tissue neoplasm of the left middle ear. Surgical resection of the tumor mass with implantation of a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) was the main modality of treatment. Middle ear neuroendocrine tumors was confirmed through positive immunohistochemistry for neuroendocrine tumor markers. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging 12 months after the surgery reported no tumor recurrence or significant residual disease with a stable PORP. Our report highlights challenges in diagnosing and treating these rare tumors, while emphasizing surgical resection pitfalls and resulting improvement of quality of life of the patient. We recommend a through follow-up of patients with unclear soft tissue masses in the middle ear to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

AB  - Objective: To examine the efficacy and safety of mastoid cavity obliteration using highly purified beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) after mastoidectomy in middle ear surgery.
   Patients: Thirteen patients with cholesteatoma invading the mastoid cavity or showing severe pathologic changes in the mastoid cavity.
   Intervention: Twelve patients underwent mastoid obliteration with highly purified beta-TCP during the first- and/or second-stage operation of a 2-stage canal-up operation: 5 patients during the first and second stages, and 7 patients during the second stage only. One patient with cholesteatoma underwent mastoid obliteration with highly purified beta-TCP during a 1-stage canal-up operation. In total, beta-TCP was applied in 18 ear operations.
   Main Outcome Measures: All patients underwent multislice computed tomography (CT) before and after surgery to assess the condition of the middle ear. The amount of residual beta-TCP granules in the mastoid cavity was assessed using the following granular shadow grading scale: Grade 0, no granular shadow in the mastoid cavity; Grade 1, residual granular shadows in part of the mastoid cavity; and Grade 2, granular shadows in most of the mastoid cavity. To assess any harmful effect of beta-TCP implanted in the mastoid cavity, continuous postoperative discharge and delayed wound healing were recorded. In addition, the bone conduction threshold was assessed using pure-tone audiometry, and the patients were asked whether they experienced vertigo or dizziness during the postoperative follow-up.
   Results: All the patients who underwent multislice CT less than 11.4 months after mastoid cavity obliteration with beta-TCP were Grade 2 on the granular shadow grading scale, whereas all those who underwent multislice CT more than 53.8 months after mastoid obliteration were Grade 0. No patient had continuous postoperative discharge, delayed wound healing, or extrusion of beta-TCP granules. No patient showed deterioration of the bone conduction threshold more than 10 dB after mastoid cavity obliteration with highly purified beta-TCP or complained of postoperative vertigo or dizziness.
   Conclusion: Highly purified beta-TCP may be safe and reliable for mastoid obliteration. Highly purified beta-TCP may also be useful in other surgical procedures, including posterior wall reconstruction of the external auditory canal and scutum plasty.

AB  - Introduction Active middle-ear implants with floating-mass transducer (FMT) technology are used to treat mild-to-severe sensorineural hearing losses. The standard surgical approach for incus vibroplasty is a mastoidectomy and a posterior tympanotomy, crimping the FMT to the long incus process. An alternative fixation side with less surgical trauma might be the short incus process and incus body. The aim of this study was to develop and test a short incus process coupling device for its functional properties in temporal bone preparations and clinical practice.
   Materials and Methods An extended antrotomy and a posterior tympanotomy were performed in 10 fresh human temporal bones. As a control for normal middle-ear function, the tympanic membrane was stimulated acoustically, and the vibration of the stapes footplate was measured using laser Doppler vibrometry. FMT-induced vibration responses of the stapes were then measured for standard attachment at the long process and for 2 types of couplers designed for attachment at the short process of the incus (SP1 and SP2 coupler). Additionally, the functional outcome in 2 patients provided with an SP2 coupler was assessed postoperatively at 2 weeks, 3 months, and then 11 months, using pure-tone audiometry, auditory thresholds for frequency-modulated (warble) tones, vibroplasty thresholds, and speech audiometry in quiet and noise.
   Results For the SP2 coupler, velocity-amplitude responses in temporal-bone preparations showed generally similar mean amplitudes as compared with the standard coupling of the FMT to the long process but with clearly increased mean amplitudes between 0.7 and 1.5 kHz and with reduced interindividual variation between 0.5 and 3 kHz. The clinical data of 2 patients with mild-to-severe sensory hearing loss showed good vibroplasty thresholds and convincing results for speech audiometry in quiet (Freiburger monosyllables at 65 dB SPL, 23 31% unaided versus 83 +/- 4% aided) and noise (Hochmair-Schulz-Moser-test at 65 dB SPL at 10 dB SNR, 32 +/- 45% unaided and 42 +/- 29% aided).
   Conclusion The attachment of the FMT to the short incus process with the SP2 coupler leads to good mechanical and functional coupling in an experimental setup and clinical practice.

AB  - Objective:
   To assess clinical and functional outcomes of a fat graft myringoplasty under local in an office setting.
   Study Design:
   Prospective case series.
   Setting:
   Tertiary care facility.
   Patients:
   Patients with a tympanic membrane (TM) perforation presenting between December 2005 and June 2019. Inclusion criteria included perforation size >25% of the surface of the pars tensa of the TM, entire perforation margins visualized through a transcanal view, and lack of spontaneous closure at the 6-month follow-up. The exclusion criteria were the presence of cholesteatoma, wet appearance of the mucosa in the tympanic cavity, ear discharge in the 3 months before surgery, or signs of ossicular inconsistency.
   Intervention:
   In-office fat graft myringoplasty technique under local anesthesia.
   Main outcome Measures:
   Complete perforation closure rate and audiometric outcomes.
   Results:
   A total of 121 patients underwent the procedure, of whom 21 had bilateral sequential procedures (total 142 ears). Average age was 51.1 +/- 18.4 years (range, 3-78 years). The size of perforation was <25% of TM in 39 (27.5%) ears, 25% to 50% of TM in 49 (34.55%) ears, 50% to 75% of TM in 34 (23.91%) ears, and 75% to 100% of TM in 20 (14.10%) ears. Complete perforation closure was evident in 130 (91.55%) of the 142 ears. Preoperative mean air conduction threshold was 59.3 dB (17-95 dB) and significantly improved into 35.6 dB (10-85 dB; P < .0004) after surgery. Preoperative air-bone gap was 30.2 dB (5-70 dB) and also significantly improved into 10.2 dB (5-65 dB; P < .0001) after surgery.
   Conclusion:
   In office fat graft myringoplasty, in adult and pediatric patients with variable perforation sizes, is a well-tolerated procedure with very satisfactory clinical results.

AB  - Background: Middle ear surgery sometimes leads to unpleasant auditory impressions such as distortion or hyperacusis that cannot be detected by conventional audiometric testing. Method: Sixty-one patients with conductive hearing loss caused by otosclerosis underwent audiological evaluation, which included a questionnaire followed by testing of the audiometric threshold, speech audiometry, and assessment and quantification of loudness perception with a commercial system (WESTRA). This investigation includes the postoperative measurement of hearing improvement and the patients' subjective impressions regarding hearing increase, distortion of speech, and hyperacusis. Results: Hearing improved in 88% of the patients. A quantification of this hearing in-crease was possible with pure tone audiometry and the Freiburg speech discrimination test. Reduced hearing threshold and lack of improvement in speech discrimination was confirmed by conventional hearing measurements. However, the presence of hyperacusis and distortion of speech could be determined by conventional audiometry in only 50 % of cases. It was interesting to note that the subjects who reported speech distortion and hyperacusis in the questionnaire were identified by their increased loudness perception using the categorical loudness scaling. Conclusion: Category loudness scaling appears to be a valuable additional clinical test to characterize postoperative phenomena as distortion of speech and hyperacusis in patients undergoing stapes surgery.

AB  - Functional outcomes and complications in otosclerosis surgery are governed by the surgeon's experience. Thus, teaching the procedure to residents to guide them through the learning process as quickly as possible is challenging. Artificial 3D-printed temporal bones are replacing cadaver specimens in many institutions to learn mastoidectomy, but these are not suitable for middle ear surgery training. The goal of this work was to adapt such an artificial temporal bone to aid the teaching of otosclerosis surgery and to evaluate this tool. We have modified a commercially available 3D-printed temporal bone by replacing the incus and stapes of the model with in-house 3D-printed ossicles. The incus could be attached to a 6-axis force sensor. The stapes footplate was fenestrated and attached to a 1-axis force sensor. Six junior surgeons (residents) and seven senior surgeons (fellows or consultants) were enrolled to perform piston prosthesis placement and crimping as performed during otosclerosis surgery. The time required to perform the tasks and the forces applied to the incus and stapes were collected and analyzed. No statistically significant differences were observed between the junior and senior groups for time taken to perform the tasks and the forces applied to the incus during crimping and placement of the prosthesis. However, significantly lower forces were applied to the stapes by the senior surgeons in comparison with the junior surgeons during prosthesis placement (junior vs senior group, 328 +/- 202.9 vs 80 +/- 99.6 mN, p = 0.008) and during prosthesis crimping (junior vs senior group, 565 +/- 233 vs 66 +/- 48.6 mN, p = 0.02). We have described a new teaching tool for otosclerosis surgery based on the modification of a 3D-printed temporal bone to implement force sensors on the incus and stapes. This tool could be used as a training tool to help the residents to self-evaluate their progress with recording of objective measurements.

AB  - Introduction: Previous reports indicated that middle ear surgery might partially improve tinnitus after surgery. However, until now, no influencing factor has been determined for tinnitus outcome after middle ear surgery.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between preoperative air-bone gap and tinnitus outcome after tympanoplasty type I.
   Methods: Seventy-five patients with tinnitus who had more than 6 months of symptoms of chronic otitis media on the ipsilateral side that were refractory to medical treatment were included in this study. All patients were evaluated through otoendoscopy, pure tone/speech audiometer, questionnaire survey using the visual analog scale and the tinnitus handicap inventory for tinnitus symptoms before and 6 months after tympanoplasty. The influence of preoperative bone conduction, preoperative air-bone-gap, and postoperative air-bone-gap on tinnitus outcome after the operation was investigated.
   Results and conclusion: The patients were divided into two groups based on preoperative bone conduction of less than 25 dB (n = 50) or more than 25 dB (n = 25). The postoperative improvement of tinnitus in both groups showed statistical significance. Patients whose preoperative air-bone-gap was less than 15 dB showed no improvement in postoperative tinnitus using the visual analog scale (p = 0.889) and the tinnitus handicap inventory (p = 0.802). However, patients whose preoperative air-bone-gap was more than 15 dB showed statistically significant improvement in postoperative tinnitus using the visual analog scale (p < 0.01) and the tinnitus handicap inventory (p = 0.016). Postoperative change in tinnitus showed significance compared with preoperative tinnitus using visual analog scale (p = 0.006). However, the correlation between reduction in the visual analog scale score and air-bone-gap (p = 0.202) or between reduction in tinnitus handicap inventory score and air-bone-gap (p = 0.290) was not significant. We suggest that the preoperative air-bone-gap can be a predictor of tinnitus outcome after tympanoplasty in chronic otitis media with tinnitus.

AB  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to present our concept in the management of extracranial temporal bone paragangliomas and demonstrate the outcome after primary surgical management of the middle ear component, with an individualized indication for adjuvant radiotherapy. Materials and methods: The records of all patients treated for extracranial jugulotympanic paragangliomas by means of primary surgical management between 2010 and 2021 were studied retrospectively. Results: Twenty-nine patients made up our study sample (mean age 58.8 years). 15 cases were managed solely by means of surgery. Out of the remaining 14 cases with reduction of the middle ear component, adjuvant irradiation was performed in 11 cases, whereas a wait-and-scan strategy was adopted at the patient's request in three cases. No further growth was detected in our study cases. Conclusion: Our protocol seems to be associated with an acceptable quality of life and a satisfactory oncologic outcome.

AB  - Objective To show the efficiency of using transmastoid atticotomy (TMA) endoscopy on the outcome of ossiculoplasty in patients with cholesteatoma. TMA is often performed as part of the surgical management of patients with middle ear cholesteatoma extending to the epitympanum. TMA can also be used as an access for endoscopic view to confirm the right alignment and stability of the ossicular prosthesis because the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane will obscure the visualization of the prosthesis. Methods A retrospective study was done at a tertiary referral institute, including 133 ears with cholesteatoma that underwent canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy (CWU) with ossicular reconstruction using titanium prosthesis between August 2013 and August 2015. Post packing of the ear canal and position, stability, and axis of the prosthesis were checked using endoscope positioned in the attic through TMA. A postoperative pure-tone average air-bone gap (ABG) of 20 dB or less was considered as a successful hearing result. Results are compared with historical control groups. Results Of the 133 ears, 88 patients underwent reconstruction with partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP), whereas the rest (45 patients) had total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP). A postoperative ABG <= 20 dB was obtained in 77.4% of all the patients (79.5% for PORP; 73.3% for TORP). Conclusion Endoscopic assessment of the ossicular prosthesis via the attic, after repositioning of the tympanomeatal flap and packing the ear canal, decreases the risk of immediate ossiculoplasty failure and improves the functional outcome after ossicular chain reconstruction in cholesteatoma surgery.

AB  - Canal wall down mastoidectomy is one of the most effective treatments for cholesteatoma. However, it results in anatomical changes in the external and middle ear with a negative impact on the patient's quality of life. To provide complete closure of the mastoid cavity and normalize the anatomy of the middle and external ear, we used human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs), GMP grade, in a guinea pig model. A method for preparing a biomaterial composed of hMSCs, hydroxyapatite, and tissue glue was developed. Animals from the treated group were implanted with biomaterial composed of hydroxyapatite and hMSCs, while animals in the control group received hydroxyapatite alone. When compared to controls, the group implanted with hMSCs showed a significantly higher ratio of new bone formation (p = 0.00174), as well as a significantly higher volume percentage of new immature bone (p = 0.00166). Our results proved a beneficial effect of hMSCs on temporal bone formation and provided a promising tool to improve the quality of life of patients after canal wall down mastoidectomy by hMSC implantation.

AB  - Objective Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (Mesna) has been proposed as a chemical aid in any surgical procedure, including cholesteatoma surgery. This review investigated the benefits and safety of Mesna during surgical management of cholesteatoma and adhesive otitis media. Method A systematic literature review was performed to identify clinical studies evaluating topical Mesna application during ear surgery (cholesteatoma or atelectasis). A qualitative analysis based on data extracted was conducted. Results From 27 articles, 5 retrospective studies were selected for a full analysis for a total of 607 patients (aged 5 to 72 years). Three studies evaluated cholesteatoma recidivism after Mesna application during cholesteatoma surgery, one study evaluated the surgical success rate of Mesna application for the treatment of atelectatic ears and adhesive otitis media, and one study evaluated potential ototoxicity of Mesna during cholesteatoma surgery. All the studies showed overall improvement in recurrence and residual cholesteatoma disease after Mesna application during surgery. Sensorineural hearing loss was not encountered after Mesna application. Conclusion Mesna application in cholesteatoma surgery could represent a valid and safe support tool during surgical treatment carried out both with microscopy and endoscopy. More studies are required to confirm these promising results.

KW  - otology
AB  - BACKGROUND: Packing of the external auditory canal after ear surgery is an established practice in most otologic centers. However, no guidelines exist concerning the management of this process. The aim of the study is to investigate otologists' habits concerning packing of the external ear canal after otologic surgery. A second objective was to collect their opinion concerning the absence of packing.
   METHODS: This study is a cross-sectional survey. We sent an online questionnaire to the 135 members of the French Otology and Neurotology Association (AFON). It was conducted between March 15, 2020, and May 15, 2020. It consisted of 11 demographic questions and 6 surgical management-related questions concerning 6 major otologic procedures.
   RESULTS: Fifty-seven members answered the survey. The most frequent packing used was ear wick with silicon sheets (48.6%) among all surgical procedures. Among participants, 62% used the same packing material for all surgical procedures. Of the participants, 96% were reluctant not to pack the external ear canal after otologic surgery.
   CONCLUSION: This study shows a great variability concerning surgeons' practices. A randomized controlled trial would be helpful to guide surgeons for ear packing after otologic surgery and assess the absence of packing.

AB  - Background: Recognition of the anatomical course of the chorda tympani nerve (CTN) is important for preventing iatrogenic injuries during middle-ear surgery.
   Purpose: This study aims to compare visualization of the CTN using two computed tomography (CT) methods: conventional high-resolution CT (C-HRCT) and ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT).
   Materials and methods We performed a retrospective visual assessment of 59 CTNs in normal temporal bones of 54 consecutive patients who underwent both C-HRCT and U-HRCT. After dividing CTN into three anatomical segments (posterior canaliculus, tympanic segment, and anterior canaliculus), two neuroradiologists scored the visualizations on a four-point scale.
   Results: On C-HRCT, the visual scores of the posterior canaliculus, tympanic segment, and anterior canaliculus were 3.5 +/- 0.7, 1.6 +/- 0.6, and 3.1 +/- 0.7, respectively. The respective values were significantly higher in all segments on U-HRCT: 3.9 +/- 0.2, 2.4 +/- 0.6, 3.5 +/- 0.6 (p < 0.01). Although the difference in scores between methods was greatest for the tympanic segment, the visual score on U-HRCT was lower for the tympanic segment than for the anterior and posterior segments (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Ultra-high-resolution CT provides superior visualization of the CTN, especially the tympanic segment.

AB  - Otorhinolaryngologists throughout the UK routinely perform middle ear operations. Although the risk of serious complications in the hands of a well-trained surgeon is very low, some of the complications of middle ear surgery are devastating to the patient viz. facial nerve palsy and complete hearing loss. The subject of informed consent is highly topical because of clinical governance and medico-legal implications. We have audited the practice of the Consultant members of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists-Head and Neck Surgeons via a postal questionnaire with regards to their consenting process prior to middle ear operations. Our study looked at the practice of discussing different complications and the complication rates, the person consenting, time spent on consenting, and the documentation. We found that wide variations exist in the consenting process. The implications of the results are discussed. This study is particularly pertinent at the present time with the implementation of the new consenting standards document published by the Department of Health.

AB  - Objective Rehabilitation options for conductive and mixed hearing loss are continually expanding, but without standard outcome measures comparison between different treatments is difficult. To meaningfully inform clinicians and patients core outcome sets (COS), determined via a recognised methodology, are needed. Following our previous work that identified hearing, physical, economic and psychosocial as core areas of a future COS, the AURONET group reviewed hearing outcome measures used in existing literature and assigned them into different domains within the hearing core area. Design Scoping review. Study Sample Literature including hearing outcome measurements for the treatment of conductive and/or mixed hearing loss. Results The literature search identified 1434 studies, with 278 subsequently selected for inclusion. A total of 837 hearing outcome measures were reported and grouped into nine domains. The largest domain constituted pure-tone threshold measurements accounting for 65% of the total outcome measures extracted, followed by the domains of speech testing (20%) and questionnaires (9%). Studies of hearing implants more commonly included speech tests or hearing questionnaires compared with studies of middle ear surgery. Conclusions A wide range of outcome measures are currently used, highlighting the importance of developing a COS to inform individual practice and reporting in trials/research.

TI  - Micro macroporous biphasic ceramics and fibrin sealant as a moldable material for bone reconstruction in chronic otitis media surgery. A 15 years experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN MEDICINE
LA  - English
KW  - CALCIUM-PHOSPHATE CERAMICS
KW  - TISSUE
AB  - Bone reconstruction is still a matter of concern in middle ear surgery despite the large number of surgical techniques proposed. Combination of biphasic calcium phosphate bioceramics with human fibrin sealant forms a moldable material easy to apply for bone reconstruction. Since 1986, we have been using this composite for reconstruction of mastoid cavities during chronic otitis media surgery. Granules of ceramic provide immediate mechanical stability and later on, promote osseoinduction when fibrin sealant forms a strong bond between granules enhancing the wound healing process. After checking feasibility, efficacy and tolerance through a controled study on dogs by filling mastoid cavities, we started a clinical series comprising yet 66 mastoid reconstructions. A retrospective data analysis on 63 patients with an average follow up of 42 months including 12 histological controls confirms the stability of bone reconstruction with a remarkable tolerance of the skin in contact. Biopsies confirmed progressive replacement of material by lamellar newly formed bone. Mastoid cavities have a randomed shape making complex bone reconstruction procedure and their filling by the composite constitutes an easy way and represents a highly satisfactory procedure. The authors considered that this should be explored in other indications of bone surgery. (C) 2003 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Introduction: A partially or fully absent or largely perforated footplate is a challenging condition that may be encountered during middle ear surgery, especially in patients with a history of chronic ear problems or with previous tympanoplasties.
   Materials and Methods: Retrospective study on a limited number of cases undergoing revision tympanoplasty in which a new footplate was created from the cartilage, and the ossicular chain was reconstructed with a titanium prosthesis in 1 stage. Minimum follow-up was 24 months. Outcome measurements included the preoperative and postoperative bone conduction to assess the function of the inner ear, and the preoperative and postoperative threshold levels of air and bone conduction in 4 frequencies to assess the possible hearing improvement.
   Results: Six patients could be included. The audiologic results showed the average air conduction gain of 11 dB. We did not observe any significant deterioration in the bone conduction which, in some cases, even improved (average change of +3 dB). The symptoms related to a perilymphatic fistula were resolved. The technique described herein has proven to be safe and reliable.
   Conclusion: Reconstruction of the footplate with autologous cartilage and simultaneous type III tympanoplasty seems to be a promising solution for those rare but challenging cases in which the footplate is partially of fully absent.

AB  - Objective/Hypothesis: The bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) is a well established mode of treatment and many studies show the audiological benefit, but none has assessed the benefit to the quality of life of patients. This study uses the validated Glasgow Benefit Inventory to quantify the changes in quality of Life. Study Design: Retrospective questionnaire study. Methods: Sixty consecutive patients receiving treatment with BAHA. were enrolled in the study, The male/female ratio was 1.26 to 1; mean patient age was 45 years. The most common indication was hearing loss secondary to mastoid disease and surgery followed by congenital atresia and chronic discharge from the ear. Results: The response rate was 85%, which is high and adds weight to the results, The general benefit score was +34 (range, +27-+48), which is comparable to middle ear surgery but just below benefit fi om cochlear implantation. The social benefit was +21 (range, +12-+37) with only +10 (range, +2-+26) for the physical score. This pattern mirrors that reported for other ear interventions, Maximum benefit was noted in patients with congenital atresias followed by discharging mastoid cavities, Conclusion: This study is the first to demonstrate significant quality of life benefit from BAHA surgical intervention as measured by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the effects and the predictive value of environmental risk factors on the success of different reconstruction materials used in ossiculoplasty.
   Study Design: Retrospective case review.
   Setting: Tertiary referral university hospital.
   Patients: Between January 2007 and October 2010, 110 patients who underwent ossiculoplasty with or without mastoidectomy due to chronic otitis media were enrolled in the study. All patients were classified into 1 of the 3 risk groups (mild, moderate, and severe) according to their measured Middle Ear Risk Index score.
   Interventions: The patients underwent exploratory tympanotomy, tympanoplasty, or tympanomastoidectomy (canal wall-up or wall-down), all with ossicular reconstruction. The ossicular reconstructions were performed using either bone cement, autologous bone interposition, or allograft material.
   Main Outcome Measures: For each patient, the air-conduction threshold and air-bone gap (ABG) were measured at the 12th month after ossiculoplasty. The ABG gain and air-conduction improvement were compared with preoperative values. The correlation of the success of ossiculoplasty with the middle ear risk group of patients was investigated. Moreover, the efficacy of different types of reconstruction material on the success of ossiculoplasty in the same risk group was evaluated.
   Results: In the mild-and moderate-risk groups, the ABG gain (p = 0.001 and p = 0.014) and air-conduction improvement (p G 0.001 for both) were statistically significant, whereas those changes were found to be insignificant in the severe-risk group. Moreover, the ABG gain and air-conduction improvement in none of the risk groups revealed a significance in favor of any of the used reconstruction materials.
   Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that none of the reconstruction materials or specific techniques have a superiority in the functional outcomes in patients from the same middle ear risk group. We conclude that the success of ossiculoplasty is highly correlated with the pathophysiological status of the middle ear and is independent of the type of replacement material.

AB  - Objective: To determine the immediate and long-term taste effects of chorda tympani nerve sacrifice in patients undergoing open cavity mastoidectomy.
   Design, setting and participants: A retrospective, questionnaire survey of patients receiving follow up and aural toilet following open cavity mastoidectomy, over a four-month period. The questionnaire assessed taste disturbance, both immediately post-operative and current. Available surgical records were reviewed for chorda tympani references.
   Results: Of 57 patients, six had undergone surgery to both ears. Of those who could recall (37/57), 24.3 per cent were aware of taste disturbance immediately after surgery, while 8.7 per cent reported current disturbance (median post-operative interval, 28.5 years; range, one month to 67 years). No bilateral surgery patients were aware of taste disturbance.
   Conclusion: Mastoidectomy consent procedure emphasises the risk of hearing loss and facial nerve injury, yet in open cavity surgery chorda tympani division is almost inevitable. Reassuringly, most post-operative taste disturbance resolves, and most patients are not aware of long-term disturbance. However, a small percentage suffer ongoing taste disturbance; this could be significant for professional chefs and wine-tasters. The risk of taste disturbance should be addressed in the consent procedure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Asymmetric hearing loss is generally defined as a moderate-to-profound hearing loss in the poorer ear and a mild-to-moderate hearing loss in the better ear. Application of a bone conduction hearing aid is one of the possible treatments for the poorer ear in asymmetric hearing loss. However, the device essentially stimulates the contralateral better ear, precluding true binaural hearing. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the application and utility of bone-anchored hearing aids in the treatment of asymmetric hearing loss.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 215 implanted subjects in our clinic and extracted a series of 27 patients affected by asymmetric hearing loss and treated with bone-anchored hearing aids. All 27 subjects had a mixed hearing loss after middle ear surgery. The preoperative and postoperative audiological data of these patients were collected and analyzed.
   RESULTS: The audiological tests showed an improvement in the performance of hearing perception of sound and speech in quiet and noise. Moreover, the subjects have positively answered the questionnaires administered to evaluate subjective benefits. All subscales of the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit and speech, spatial, and qualities of hearing scale showed a significant improvement with the device.
   CONCLUSION: Bone-anchored hearing aids are a suitable treatment for asymmetric hearing loss. When other devices cannot be utilized or are not indicated, the bone conduction devices may allow good audiological results.

AB  - Background. The treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma requires surgical treatment and the reconstruction of the temporal bone, which represents an ongoing problem. Otologists have focused on the research of materials allowing an airy middle ear and the preservation of hearing function to reconstruct the temporal bone. Methods. This study evaluated the effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) and a combined biomaterial in the healing process of postoperative temporal bone defects in an animal model. Cultured human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hBM-MSCs) were mixed with hydroxyapatite (Cem-Ostetic (R)), and subsequently applied as a bone substitute after middle ear surgery, showing that the therapeutic potential of hBM-MSCs associated with bone regeneration and replacement is directly influenced by CsA, confirming that it promotes the survival of MSCs in vivo. Results. The therapeutic efficacy of the combination of MSCs with CsA is greater than the sole application of MSCs in a hydroxyapatite carrier. Conclusion. The reconstruction of a temporal bone defect using hBM-MSCs requires an immunosuppressant to improve the results of treatment.

AB  - Purpose To describe and analyse functional treatment of temporal bone chondroblastoma (TBCh). Methods From January 2000 to June 2019, at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France, patients with TBCh were enrolled in this study. All cases routinely performed pre-operatory work-up including evaluation of performance status, audio-vestibular function test, ear endoscopy, contrasted CT scan and MRI of head and neck region; in one case we also performed an angio-CT scan. All patients underwent resection of the tumour with a "functional" approach Results Three male patients (mean age 46,6 years)-two primary tumours and one recurrence-were treated. In all three cases the tumour invaded the middle ear with a variable degree of hearing loss and infiltration of temporal bone structures. All surgeries were performed with a microscopic approach associated with open/endoscopic approach when necessary. Inner ear and facial nerve were speared in all cases and the TMJ was partially resected in 2 cases due to its moderate involvement. At present, after a mean follow-up of 103 months (range 40-225 months), only one case presented recurrence which has been successfully treated with radiotherapy. Conclusions Our results of treatment suggest that functional surgery can be relevant in the management of TBCh since it is focused on both treatment of this pathology and maintenance of a good quality of life.

AB  - Pulsed infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) lasers have been suggested for use in middle ear surgery due to potential fiberoptic delivery, decreased thermal trauma and precise ablation characteristics. Although attention has been focused on the thermal and photoacoustic events that occur during pulsed laser ablation of hard tissue, there are few studies which evaluate the acoustic energy generated from these devices from an audiological standpoint. In this study, the mastoid cavities of cadaveric human temporal bones were irradiated with a holmium: yttrium aluminium garnet (Ho:YAG) laser (lambda=2.12 mu m) using the following parameters: 5, 10, and 15 Hz pulse repetition rate and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 W average power. During ablation, acoustic measurements were made using a sound level meter positioned 5 cm away from the target site. With each set of laser parameters, the sound intensity exceeded 85 dB (dBA scale). Peak intensities of 125 dB were measured, and a saturation effect noted above 4 W or 500 mJ/pulse. The clinical significance of these findings is discussed and the acoustical aspects of middle ear function and noise trauma are reviewed.

AB  - Hypothesis: This study aimed to assess the possibility of hearing restoration after acoustic tumor removal.
   Background: Hearing restoration surgery may be indicated after surgery of bilateral acoustic tumors or surgery of acoustic tumor in the only hearing ear. The choice is between cochlear implantation and brainstem implantation.
   Methods: From the temporal bone collection at the House Ear Institute, Los Angeles, the author histologically examined eight temporal bones from seven patients who had undergone acoustic tumor removal during their lifetime. Special emphasis was put on examining the patency of the cochlear turns and on survival of the spiral ganglion cells and cochlear nerve.
   Results: This study showed that after translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removal, there is progressive osteoneogenesis of the cochlea associated with almost complete degeneration of the spiral ganglion cells and cochlear nerve. Similar findings were noticed after middle fossa removal of acoustic tumor with unsuccessful hearing preservation.
   Conclusions: The histologic changes described in the cochlea and cochlear nerve represent the effects of ischemia resulting from inadvertent cutting of the blood supply during acoustic tumor removal. It is possible to do cochlear implantation after acoustic tumor removal provided that the result of promontory electrical stimulation test is positive (the cochlear nerve is intact) and that implantation is done at the time of acoustic tumor removal or shortly thereafter, before cochlear ossification is complete.

KW  - Tympanoplasty
AB  - Objective: After tympanoplasty, it is often challenging to differentiate between different causes of a remaining air bone gap (ABG). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) offers a new approach for combined morphologic and functional measurements of the tympanic membrane and adjacent parts of the middle ear. Thus, it provides valuable diagnostic information in patients with a reduced sound transfer after middle ear surgery.
   Patient and intervention: A patient with history of tympanoplasty and a persistent ABG was investigated with endoscopic OCT before revision surgery.
   Main Outcome Measures: The oscillation behavior and the thickness of the reconstructed tympanic membrane was determined. The oscillation amplitudes of the inserted prosthesis were compared to a finite element model simulation and to the clinical findings and the audiometric data of the patient.
   Results: OCT measurements showed a reduced oscillation amplitude of the prosthesis while revealing an aerated middle ear and good coupling of the prosthesis. Transfer loss measured by OCT showed a similar progression as the ABG measured by pure-tone audiometry with a mean divergence of 4.45 dB.
   Conclusion: Endoscopic OCT is a promising tool for the evaluation of tympanoplasty outcome. It supports established otologic diagnostics and can help differentiating between different causes of conductional hearing loss.

AB  - Chronic Otitis media with Cholesteatoma is a destructive lesion of middle ear and mastoid region. In a series of 122 patients with established diagnosis of atticoantral disease. clinical characteristics of consecutive 74 patients with cholesteatoma otitis media were compared with 48 patients with chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma (Controls).The patients answered a questionnaire, preoperative and perioperative clinical observations were recorded. There were no specific presenting symptoms or clinical signs that could distinguished the cholesteatoma patients. However, these patients had a significantly higher incidence (32%) of previous middle ear surgery than the control patients (18%). Aural bleeding was reported in higher number in controlled cases (8.5%) as compare to cholesteatoma cases (1.3%). Pars flaccida perforation was noted in 94 % (80% isolated) in cholesteatoma patients. Extracranial complications e.g. mastoid abscess, postaural fistula, mastoiditis and otitis externa was note in 6.7% and 4% respectively in cholesteatoma and control group. The percentage of labyrinthitis and facial nerve affection was 11% and 4.1 % in cholesteatoma cases respectively against 6% and 2% in control group. The cholesteatoma was not evident until the time of surgical exploration in as many as 28% of cases. Therefore surgical exploration appears to be the reliable and safest way to identify cholesteatoma.

AB  - Background: There are transmastoid, transtemporal and combined approaches for surgical management of endaural encephaloceles. The advantages of a transmastiod approach are the exploration and option of surgical treatment of the middle ear cavity without craniotomy. Nevertheless there are recent studies preferring the transtemporal or combined approach because of the better survey. Patient: We present a 27-year old male patient, who developed hearing loss and otorrhea of the right side. He underwent middle ear surgery associated with cholesteatoma three times before. On examination there was a smooth pulsatile mass taking origin in the roof and almost filling the external auditory canal. High-resolution CT and MRI scans of the petrous bone demonstrated a spherical soft tissue mass communicating with the middle cranial fossa. The encephalocele was exposed and resected through a transmastiodal approach. Behind the cele a relapsing cholesteatoma was found and resected in the same session. The laterobasilar defect was sealed with ear cartilage and a perichondrium flap. Conclusion: There are three different surgical approaches to manage laterobasilar encephaloceles. Due to the history of a previous cholesteatoma we performed a transmastoidal approach. A transtemporal approach alone would have failed to notice the relapsing cholesteatoma and would have led to a greater trauma.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the recently proposed SAMEO-ATO framework for middle ear and mastoid surgery, by correlating it with the functional outcome in a large cohort of patients operated for middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma in a tertiary referral center. Methods We retrospectively included all surgeries for middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma undergone in our Department between January 2009 and December 2014, by excluding revision surgeries, congenital and petrous bone cholesteatoma. All surgeries were classified according to the SAMEO-ATO framework. The post-operative air bone gap (ABG) was calculated and chosen as benchmark parameter for the correlation analysis. Results 282 consecutive surgeries for middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma were released in the study period on a total of 273 patients, with a mean age of 41.2 years. All patients were followed for an average period of 55.3 months. 54% of patients underwent M2c mastoidectomy (Canal Wall Down, CWD), while the remaining underwent Canal Wall Up (CWU) procedures, being M1b2a mastoidectomy the most common one (33%). Mean pre-operative and post-operative ABGs were 29.2 and 23.5 dB, with a significant improvement (p < 0.0001). 'Mastoidectomy' and 'Ossicular reconstruction' parameters of SAMEO-ATO showed significant association with postoperative ABG, with smaller residual gaps for the classes Mx and On, and worse hearing results for M3a and Ox. Conclusion Our results show the utility of SAMEO-ATO framework, and in particular of 'M' (Mastoidectomy) and 'O' (Ossicular reconstruction) parameters, in predicting the hearing outcome.

AB  - Conclusion. Artificial middle ear mucosa (AMEM), a sheet of mucosal cells grown on collagen gel populated with fibroblasts, is useful as graft material that is able to promote mucosal regeneration after middle ear surgery. Objectives. Regeneration of the middle ear mucosa and pneumatization of the mastoid cavity is critical for good prognosis. We examined whether implantation of AMEM into damaged middle ear cavity would promote mucosal regeneration. Materials and methods. AMEM was prepared as described previously using epithelial cells and fibroblasts isolated from the rabbit middle ear. We implanted AMEM into rabbit middle ear from which mucosa had been surgically removed and evaluated its histological and functional recovery 8 weeks later. Three other groups were used for comparison: a normal control group, a mucosa-eliminated group, and a collagen-implanted group. Results. AMEM grew to be morphologically similar to the native middle ear mucosa. Electron microscope studies showed that implanted AMEM has basal lamina and cilia. AMEM implantation suppressed bone hyperplasia and granulation, leading to better mucosal regeneration. Mucosal gas exchange was also significantly improved after implantation.

AB  - Objective: Residual cholesteatoma most frequently occurs where visualization and surgical access are restricted by anatomic constraints. Other factors that compromise surgical field visualization might also increase rates of residual cholesteatoma. We evaluated whether impaired surgical field clarity from bleeding increases rates of residual cholesteatoma.
   Study Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Setting: Tertiary care hospital.
   Patients: Consecutive series of children having intact canal wall surgery for cholesteatoma.
   Interventions: Impact of bleeding on surgical field clarity was assessed intraoperatively on a six-point scale.
   Main Outcome Measures: Presence of residual cholesteatoma was established at follow up clinical encounters, second stage procedures, and with magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the influence of surgical field clarity and other factors on rates of residual cholesteatoma.
   Results: Surgery was completed on 232 ears and residual cholesteatoma found in 45 (19%) ears. Multivariate regression analysis of cases completed with atticotomy or tympanoplasty demonstrated that surgical field clarity was a significant predictor of residual cholesteatoma (OR [odds ratio] 4, 95%CI 1.05-15; p = 0.04). Cholesteatoma extent was the most significant predictor of residual cholesteatoma when including cases requiring combined approach (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.4-3.3; p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Impaired surgical field clarity from intraoperative bleeding is associated with increased risk of residual cholesteatoma in surgery for meso/epitympanic cholesteatoma. These findings are of particular significance for endoscopic ear surgery in which management of bleeding can be more difficult and support the use of techniques, such as hypotensive general anesthesia, that minimize surgical site bleeding and improve surgical field visualization.

Objective. To investigate the efficacy of dexamethasone in reducing postoperative dizziness, nausea and pain in patients undergoing canal wall-up mastoidectomy. Material and methods. A prospective, randomized, double-blind study was performed between January 2002 and December 2004. A total of 162 patients (66 males, 96 females) scheduled for canal wall-up mastoidectomy were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive either i.v. dexamethasone (10 mg in 2 ml) or i.v. placebo (2 ml of normal saline) during mastoidectomy. A standard general anesthetic technique was employed throughout the surgical procedure. At 3, 6 and 24 h after surgery, patients completed questionnaires regarding postoperative dizziness, nausea and pain, with their responses being given on a visual analog scale. Results. There were no postoperative complications in either group. Compared to the placebo group, the dexamethasone group showed reduced postoperative dizziness and reduced nausea (p < 0.05 for both) at 24 h postoperatively. Compared to the placebo group, dexamethasone had no effect on postoperative pain.

AB  - Objective: Evaluation of morphologic and functional long-term results of palisade cartilage tympanoplasty (PCT) combined with titanium ossicular replacement prostheses.
   Study Design: Retrospective review of tympanoplasties.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: Twenty-nine patients (12 women and 17 men; mean age, 39 yr; range, 17-72 yr) operated on more than 9 years ago (mean follow up, 9.1 yr) because of cholesteatoma, adhesive otitis, chronic otitis media, subtotal tympanic membrane defects, and tympanic fibrosis requiring tympanoplasty.
   Interventions: Tympanoplasty, applying the PCT. For ossiculoplasty, total or partial titanium ossicular replacement prostheses were used.
   Main Outcome Measures: Questionnaire on postoperative course, otoscopic findings, and hearing results using a 4-frequency pure-tone average air-bone gap.
   Results: A recurrent defect was not observed. The graft take rate was 100%. There was one case of prosthesis protrusion which required revision surgery and insertion of a shorter prosthesis. A pure-tone average air-bone gap of 0 to 10 dB was seen pre-operatively in 1 ear, 11 to 30 dB in 16 ears, and 31 to 59 dB in 12 ears. Postoperatively, the corresponding numbers were 10, 15, and 4 ears.
   Conclusion: The PCT is a reliable surgical method to manage difficult middle ear pathology on a long-term (>9 yr) basis. It offers satisfactory morphologic and functional results in combination with titanium prosthesis ossiculoplasty.

AB  - Magnesium alloys have been investigated in different fields of medicine and represent a promising biomaterial for implants due to characteristics like bioabsorbability and osteoinduction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usability of magnesium as implant material in middle ear surgery. Magnesium implants were placed into the right middle ear of eighteen New Zealand White rabbits. Nine animals were euthanized after four weeks and nine animals after three month. The petrous bones were removed and embedded in epoxy resin. The specimens were then polished, stained and evaluated with the aid of a light microscope. The histological examination revealed a good biocompatibility. After four weeks, a beginning corrosion of the implant's surface and low amount of trabecular bone formation in the area of the stapes base plate was observed. A considerable degradation of implants and obvious bone formation was found three month after implantation. The magnesium alloy used in the present study partly corroded too fast, so that a complete bone reconstruction could not be established in time. The increased osteoinduction on the stapes base plate resulted in a tight bone-implant bonding. Thus, a promising application of magnesium could be a coating of biomaterials in order to improve the bony integration of implants.

AB  - Repeated exposure to a topical aminoglycoside in patients with ear discharge can induce a delayed hypersensitivity reaction eventually. A postal survey conducted by the authors showed that 75% of UK otolaryngologists routinely prescribe topical aminoglycosides to their patients following ear surgery. This is a prospective study on the result of skin patch testing on 119 patients with chronic otitis media and 30 patients with otosclerosis who were scheduled for otosurgery. Any history of previous exposure to antibiotic eardrops for each patient was recorded. Overall, 14.1% of the patients had a positive skin reaction to one of the aminoglycosides (13.4% for Gentamicin; 12.8% for Neomycin and 4.5% for Framycetin). Sixteen per cent (16%) of the patients with chronic otitis media and 6.7% of the patients with otosclerosis were allergic to one of the aminoglycosides commonly found in antibiotic eardrops. Patients who received more than five courses of antibiotics eardrops previously had a greater tendency of developing allergy to the aminoglycosides (35.3%).

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: Data from patients registered for myringoplasty during 2002 to 2012 in the Swedish National Quality Registry for Myringoplasty.
   Study Design: Both conventional myringoplasty and fat-graft techniques were used aimed at healing the tympanic membrane in noninfected ears.
   Methods: Analysis was performed on data in a national database collected from 32 ear, nose, and throat clinics. Surgical procedures and outcomes, and patient satisfaction from a questionnaire were studied.
   Results: The database was comprised of 3,775 surgical procedures, with follow-up available for analysis. One-third were children under the age of 15 years. The most common indication for surgery was infection prophylaxis. The overall healing rate of the tympanic membrane after surgery was 88.5%, with a high mean patient satisfaction. Complications registered were postoperative infection, tinnitus, or taste disturbance that occurred in 5.8% of patients.
   Conclusions: Swedish results for a large number of patients who completed myringoplasty are presented. The success rate in this study is comparable to other studies, and good patient-reported outcome measures of myringoplasty are presented. Databases for surgical procedures and clinical audits are systematic processes for continuous learning in healthcare. This study shows that clinical databases can be utilized to analyze national results of surgical procedures.

AB  - Objectives: To describe taste changes following a nonmastoidectomy approach to cochlear implantation (CI). Study Design: Retrospective. Method: Ninety-four adult patients (63 females) who underwent CI using the suprameatal approach (SMA) were studied. They responded to a questionnaire on post-CI taste changes, duration of these changes and their influence on eating habits, weight and quality of life. Results: Fourteen patients (14.9%, all females) reported taste dysfunction (13 ranked as being mild). In 1 patient, the symptoms lasted >24 months, and dysgeusia was counted as permanent in this case. One patient changed her eating habits: she now prefers vegetarian food. The patients with early (<1 month) recovery of taste function were younger than those with delayed recovery. Conclusions: The SMA is a favorable technique for the preservation of taste sensation in CI patients. Manipulation on the chorda tympani nerve during the SMA did not much disturb the patients' eating habits and their quality of life. Copyright (C) 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background: We explored a new method for measuring the length of artificial stapes during stapedotomy in otoendoscop-ic middle-ear surgery using a flexible ruler.Material/Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 56 cases of otosclerosis, comprising 56 ears with a follow-up of over 6 months and complete data. Patients were admitted to the Department of Otology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Union Shenzhen Hospital from July 2020 to June 2022. SPSS statistical software was used for efficacy analysis. The results of different measurement methods on the implantation time of the pros-thesis and postoperative hearing follow-up were compared.Results: The 56 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. In 1 case measured by the metal measuring stick, the prosthesis was too short and was replaced during the operation; 2 patients experienced transient dizziness postoperatively, and the other patients had no surgical complications. All 56 patients had varying degrees of hearing improvement after surgery, and no dislocation of the ossicular chain was observed during the follow-up. There was a statistically significant difference in the implantation time of the prosthesis between the dif-ferent measurement methods (P<0.05). The improvement in hearing in the flexible ruler group was statistical-ly significant (P<0.05).Conclusions: The selection of the length of the ossicular prosthesis is a crucial step in the operation and can directly affect hearing outcomes. The use of a flexible ruler to measure prosthesis length can significantly shorten operation time and improve hearing, and the ruler is easily obtainable. It is worth promoting its application in ear endo-scopic stapedotomy.

AB  - Eustachian tube dysfunction is considered a major contributor to chronic middle ear disease. In clinical case series, the results of balloon dilation (balloon Eustachian tuboplasty, BET) as a treatment for Eustachian tube dysfunction have been reported.
   This study aims to analyze whether patients undergoing planned surgery for chronic middle ear disease would benefit from additional BET.
   In a randomized controlled, patient and observer (not surgeon)-blind clinical study, 100 adult patients with planned surgery for chronic middle ear disease will be investigated. Patients will be randomized into two groups, one of which (50%) will receive additional BET of the affected side during the planned surgery. Eustachian tube function will be evaluated using the Valsalva maneuver and tubomanometry according to EstSve, as well as on the basis of patient reports. Various scores will be used as outcome measures, including ETS-5 (Eustachian Tube Score 5), the extended version ETS-7, and the ETDQ-7 (Seven-Item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire). Follow-up is at 3, 6, and 12 months.
   From June to December 2015, 162 patients underwent microscopic ear surgery. Inclusion criteria were not fulfilled by 90 patients. Of the remaining 72 patients with chronic middle ear disease, 12 patients (17 %) have been randomized so far, 28 (39 %) did not exhibit Eustachian tube dysfunction, and 32 (44 %) patients could not be included for other reasons.
   The rate of recruitment was lower than expected. Depending on the case number calculations for the patient groups identified in the study for whom BET might be particularly beneficial, multicenter studies in specific disease groups may follow.

AB  - Introduction: Adhesion formation is a frequent and serious post-operative problem in ENT surgery. This study assessed the effect of two anti-adhesive haemostatic agents on an experimental guinea pig model.
   Materials and methods: The middle-ear mucosa of 14 guinea pigs was exposed to surgical trauma. After surgery, Arista (TM) AH was injected into the right middle ear of seven animals, while Ankaferd Blood Stopper was injected into the right middle ear of the other seven animals. The left ears were left untreated and regarded as the control group. The three groups were compared by histological examination at post-operative week 4.
   Results: In each of the three groups, consolidation of the lamina propria and epithelium mucosae, increments in the number of active fibroblasts, collagen fibrils and inflammatory cells, and increased vascular dilation were observed on haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, and were more prominent in the control and Ankaferd Blood Stopper groups. Epithelial thickness and capillary vasodilation were significantly lower in the Arista (TM) AH group compared with the control and Ankaferd Blood Stopper groups (p < 0.008).
   Conclusion: Arista (TM) AH may prevent the formation of adhesions in middle-ear surgery. Further experimental studies are required to determine its ototoxic potential.

AB  - A nationwide survey was performed in Sweden regarding the way that practicing otosurgeons utilize radiological imaging before and after performing surgery of the middle ear and temporal bone. Sixty-six surgeons from 30 different otorhinolaryngology departments participated in the study. These represented all hospitals in Sweden where ear surgery is performed to some degree. A questionnaire was designed consisting of 18 questions that were assigned to 4 different groups. Questions in group 1 assessed the general conditions regarding imaging services in the local hospital. Questions in group 2 illuminated the level of tuition and competence development when it comes to judging radiological examinations. Group 3 questions mirrored the clinical routines when ordering various specific investigations. In group 4, the questions were aimed at describing which type of information the surgeons wanted to obtain from the imaging investigations. The answers gave a good picture of how Swedish otosurgeons use the services offered by their local radiological departments. One of the conclusions is that, although there is consensus regarding certain types of examinations in specific conditions, there is a great variation in how surgeons utilize radiological imaging in many of the most common clinical conditions. It is obvious that the routines regarding the use of radiology in conjunction with ear surgery vary from place to place and also between different surgeons. Whether a consensus can be reached in the future regarding this issue remains to be seen. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The aim of this work is to reexamine our experience with the treatment of conductive and mixed hearing loss using the Baha system. The system was implanted in 47 patients (16 adults and 31 children under the age of 14), bilaterally in two cases. The causes of hypoacusis were bilateral congenital aural atresia (31 patients), bilateral chronic otitis media or outcomes of middle-ear surgery (Gillett et al. in J laryngol Otol 120:537-542, 2006), and otosclerosis (Pazzaglia et al. in Acta Orthop Scand 54:574-579, 1983). The following parameters were assessed: mean preoperative air- and bone-conduction thresholds for the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz; mean postoperative threshold with the Baha; hearing improvement calculated by subtracting the postoperative threshold with the Baha from the preoperative threshold for air conduction in the better ear; speech audiometry test; improvement in the quality of life, calculated using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory for the adult patients and the Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory for paediatric patients; frequency and type of surgical complications. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 38 months. The audiological results were satisfactory, with air bone gap closure in 85.1% of cases. In terms of quality of life, assessment using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory showed a clear-cut improvement in health for all the 45 patients that answered to the questionnaires in our study. Out of the 49 operations that were performed, complications were reported in 3 cases (6.1%): 2 cases of skin regrowth around the titanium screw and one in which the abutment was not osseointegrated. The data from this study show that the Baha system offers a high percentage of success, which can significantly improve the patient's quality of life, and a low rate of complications.

AB  - To rehabilitate most cases of conductive hearing loss closure of ear drum perforations and rebuilding of the ossicular chain can be performed. Due to the great number of biocompatible bone substitute materials available it is occasionally difficult for the surgeon to choose the most favorable substitute. Autogenous structures (ossicles, cortical bone, cartilage) and allogenous tissues (ossicles, cortical bone, cartilage, dentin) are possible bone replacement materials. Xenogenic tissue is currently not used in middle ear surgery. Ionomer cement is a hy brid material for replacement of bone but does not fit direct classification of the various classes of alloplastic materials in current use: that is, metals (gold, steel wire, platinum, titanium), plastics (polyethylene, polytetrafluorethylene) and ceramics (ceramic oxide, carbon, calcium-phosphate ceramic,vitreous ceramic). For restoration of the sound conductive apparatus preference is given to autogenous ossicles because cortical bone is resorbed and cartilage weakens over time. Most surgeons do not use allogenous tissue, because of the possible transmission of such infectious disease as immunodeficiency syndrome or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Only dentin deserves special atten- lion as a possible bone substitute in the middle ear because its form can be preserved during sterilization. Based on the observations available to dale, it becomes apparent that titanium implants hold greater promise than gold. Form-stable synthetic materials are not generally recommended due to foreign body reactions which have been confirmed by many investigators. Ceramic materials (e.g. ceramic oxide, carbon, calcium-phosphate ceramic, glass ceramic) are well tolerated in the middle ear and have also proved to be useful over time. Hybrid bone substitute ionomer cement is easily workable and well integrated, showing a good functional outcome. For many years good results in otosclerosis surgery have been achieved with a prosthesis made of platinum-wire and Teflon. Short-term follow-up periods hold great promise with pistons made of gold. Autogenous ossicles, ionomer cement and recently titanium protheses - as far as usable - are employed by the author for reconstructing the middle ear. For the time being platinum-Teflon prostheses and gold are used in otosclerosis surgery.

AB  - Objective: Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) has been increasingly adopted to enhance visualization during otologic surgery including pediatric cholesteatoma resection. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the current literature reporting rates of residual cholesteatoma to evaluate outcomes of EES in the pediatric population. Data Sources: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane. Study Selection: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations (PRISMA), we systematically reviewed studies that reported outcomes for cholesteatoma surgery in children using the endoscope. Studies were included if they described the use of the endoscope for middle ear surgery and measured outcomes following cholesteatoma resection in pediatric patients. Data Extraction: Identified articles were assessed for study design, sample size, inclusion of pediatric population, the presence of a comparison group, outcomes measured such as: residual disease rate, recurrent cholesteatoma, audiologic outcome, quality of life measures, and complications. Data Synthesis: Fourteen articles in the literature discussed cholesteatoma outcomes in children when the endoscope was employed. Residual disease rate ranged from 0 to 22% when endoscope was used for dissection compared with 11 to 55% when endoscope was used for inspection or not at all. A meta-analysis was conducted on 11 studies. There was a significant risk reduction in residual disease rates for endoscopic dissection when compared with microscope (RR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.37-0.63, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Among the studies included in this review, EES was associated with lower rates of residual cholesteatoma compared with traditional microscopic techniques. Additional prospective studies are needed to further assess these findings.

AB  - Objective: To assess long-term results and present experience with a high-porosity hydroxyapatite ceramic for obliterating large open mastoid cavities.
   Study-Design: Cross-sectional cohort study.
   Setting: Tertiary academic referral center.
   Patients: All patients who underwent tympanomastoid surgery for chronic middle ear disease or revision surgery with reduction of an open mastoid cavity using a highly porous hydroxyapatite matrix material (HMM) between May 2005 and June 2013 were assessed for eligibility. Twenty three patients (56.9 +/- 8.3 yr) were included.
   Intervention: Primary middle ear surgery or evision surgery using a HMM.
   Main Outcome Measures: Pure-tone average, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate osseoinduction, osseointegration and presence of cholesteatoma, current quality of life assessed by Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory and change in quality of life post-intervention assessed by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory.
   Results: Patients were reexamined after a mean follow-up period of 88.3 months (SD 21.4 mo) after obliteration of the open mastoid cavity with IIMM. Compared with visit 1, patients showed a significantly reduced ABG at visit 2 (29.22 dB +/- 2.71 dB versus 12.77 dB +/- 3.46 dB).
   CT scan was carried out in 21 patients (91%) patients and 17 patients (74%) underwent MRI.
   Revision surgery was required in a total of 17 cases (74%). In four patients recurrent cholesteatoma was found at follow up.
   Conclusions: Poor cavity obliteration, a high rate of revision surgery and difficult differentiation between recurrent cholesteatoma and granulation tissue in CT scan was observed.

AB  - Objectives: Mastoid pressure dressing (MPD) has routinely been used following major ear surgery, such as cochlear implant (CI) surgery, to prevent postoperative wound complications. To date, controlled studies have suggested no difference in the incidence of wound complications following MPD use. However, there is a variation in the practice of MPD usage across pediatric CI surgeons. In this study, we aimed to identify the most common type of postoperative dressing management after pediatric cochlear implantation and the factors in the decision-making process for post-surgical care amongst Canadian pediatric CI surgeons.
   Methods: Canadian Otolaryngologists who perform pediatric CI surgery were identified (n = 18) and contacted via email to complete a short online questionnaire regarding current post-operative head dressing practice following CI surgery. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the response data.
   Results: The participants provided an approximate number of CI's they performed in 2016. 100% of the recipients completed the survey. Approximately 376 CI's were completed in 2016 with an average of 21 CI's per surgeon. 61% of participants routinely used MPDs following surgery justified by reasons such as wound protection, institutional standard of care, and physician's original training practice.
   Conclusion: There is no clear consensus on the use of MPDs amongst Canadian pediatric CI surgeons. Since the current evidence in the literature suggests no difference in wound complication incidence post-surgery with MPD use, a change in postoperative dressing management to non-use in those that employ this practice may be justified. Eliminating the usage of a MPD may also have potential economic benefits. Further prospective controlled studies may be warranted.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: Facial synkinesis and hyperkinesis commonly impair the outcome of facial nerve palsy. Botulinum toxin type A has shown positive results in the treatment of these symptoms. Our experience is reported in this article. Study Design: Prospective study. Methods: Forty-one patients affected by facial synkinesis and hyperkinesis due to facial palsy were treated. The etiology of the facial palsy was: 28 Bell's palsy cases, nine iatrogenic cases (seven acoustic neuroma surgeries, one tympano-jugular glomus tumor removal, and one middle ear surgery), three herpes zoster virus cases, and one case of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Botulinum toxin type A was used in the treatment. Clinical evaluation was obtained through the Sunnybrook Grading Scale and an author's modification of this method purposely designed for evaluation of hyperkinesis. Further evaluation through a self-administered synkinesis questionnaire was also performed. Results: All patients showed some improvement of synkinesis and hyperkinesis after treatment. The mean values of the data obtained, regardless of the method of evaluation, gave statistically significant results. Correlation between objective and subjective evaluation methods was also statistically positive. Conclusions: This work stresses the importance of considering synkinesis and hyperkinesis separately because they are different conditions. These two symptoms showed improvement after botulinum toxin treatment, but only hyperkinesis showed a positive correlation when objective and subjective evaluations were performed. This treatment is effective in the management of facial synkinesis and hyperkinesis due to facial palsy, thus improving quality of life. It is a safe, minimally invasive treatment that can be repeated.

AB  - Introduction: Majority of petrous bone and lateral skull base pathologies are benign in nature. The complex anatomy usually warrants an extensive approach with associated morbidity.
   Case summary: Two cases of petrous bone cholesteatoma (1 congenital cholesteatoma with facial palsy and 1 acquired cholesteatoma) and a case of glomus tympanicum were treated with exclusive endoscopic transcanal approach. The cases of petrous cholesteatoma were addressed with trans-promontorial and infra-cochlear approaches. The mean operative time was approximately 140 min. No CSF otorrhoea was noticed in the post-operative period. The average period of hospital stay was 3.7 days.
   Conclusion: In the subset of cases with limited benign disease an endoscopic trans-canal approach is a better alternative to an external approach. It decreases operative time, blood loss, chance of meningitis, morbidity and hospital stay. The lack of depth perception is a major hurdle which can be come over by experience in endoscopic middle ear surgery. This approach can create direct access to cochlea/petrous apex/internal auditory canal (IAC)/Supra-geniculate ganglion region.

AB  - Objectives: To identify the mucin gene and its expressing cells in the middle ear mucosa with chronic otitis media (COM), and to study the correlation between infiltration of inflammatory cells in the submucosa and expression of the mucin gene in the mucosal epithelium with COM Study Design: Middle ear mucosal specimens removed from the inferior promontory area of 19 patients undergoing middle ear surgery for COM were studied Methods: Sections were stained with H&E, Alcian blue-periodic acid Schiff (AB-PAS), polyclonal MUC5B antibody, and specific MUC5B riboprobe for histological, histochemical, immunohistochemical, and mucin mRNA analyses. Results: H&E staining revealed pseudostratified epithelia in 18 of the middle ear specimens with COM and cuboidal secretory epithelia in one. AB-PAS staining of epithelia revealed abundant secretory cells and their products (glycoconjugates). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated that the secretory cells of the middle ear mucosa with COM expressed MUC5B mucin mRNA and its product MUC5B mucin. Conclusions: The MUC5B mucin gene and its product were identified in the middle ear secretory cells of patients with COM. Its expression was extensive in pseudostratified mucosal epithelia and related to infiltration of inflammatory cells in the submucosa of the middle ear cleft with COM, suggestive that inflammatory cell products are involved in the production of MUC5B.

AB  - Purpose Revision stapes surgery is a challenging procedure performed in relatively small numbers compared to other middle ear procedures. Despite numerous data on hearing results of different middle ear surgeries, the audiological standards for successful outcome of this procedure are still not clarified. On the basis of well-documented data, we wanted to determine what the expected audiological results and complications are after revision stapes surgery in order to set a realistic threshold for surgical success. Methods After the protocol registration in the PROSPERO database, a systematic review was performed in multiple databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceOpen, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar) according to PRISMA guidelines. Twelve articles were reviewed according to the inclusion criteria. A total of 1032 cases were obtained for evaluation. A modified version of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess publication quality. Results Average air-bone gap (ABG) gain was 17.3 dB, average air conduction (AC) gain was 17.5 dB. The average postoperative air-bone gap was 11.1 dB. The postoperative ABG distribution was the following 0-10 dB: 53.3%, > 10-20 dB: 28.2%, > 20 dB: 18.5%. SNHL as a surgical complication was described in a total of 17 cases (1.6%), no equilibrium disorder was reported. Conclusion The pooled data suggest that revision stapes surgery is an effective solution after failure of previous stapes surgery. However, the results are clearly inferior to those of primary stapedotomies. Hence, we need to apply different expectations and use different standards in the indication and evaluation of this type of surgery.

AB  - ObjectiveTo assess the rate of dilatory (chronic obstructive) eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) in adult patients scheduled for surgery for chronic inflammatory middle ear disease.PatientsWe included adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease (chronic suppurative otitis media, adhesive otitis media [middle ear atelectasis], cholesteatoma). We excluded patients with pathologies that do not stem from ETD (e.g., noninflammatory chronic middle ear disease [e.g., otosclerosis], tumors, solely external auditory canal conditions), patients scheduled for implantable electronic hearing devices independent of disease, patients with otitis media with effusion and scheduled paracentesis or ventilation tubes only, patients with previous radiotherapy or previous balloon eustachian tuboplasty, and children and patients unable to complete questionnaires.Intervention(s)We evaluated ETD with Valsalva maneuver and in case of negative or unclear Valsalva with the eustachian tube score (ETS). A negative Valsalva maneuver and an ETS score of 5 or lower were used to define dilatory (chronic obstructive) ETD.Main Outcome Measure(s)Rate of ETD in the included patients.ResultsFrom a total of 482 consecutive patients, 350 patients had positive Valsalva maneuver or ETS score higher than 5. From the 193 patients with negative or unclear Valsalva maneuver, 77 patients had an ETS score of 5 or lower, and 55 rejected further diagnostics with ETS.ConclusionsBased on a large cohort of adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease scheduled for middle ear surgery, the majority (82%) seems to have no dilatory (chronic obstructive) ETD that can be detected with current routine clinical methods and tubomanometry. Common pathophysiological explanations should be questioned critically, especially in the context of communication with patients.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this quantitative systematic review is to compare the efficacy and side effects of combining one of the 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5-HT) with droperidol or dexamethasone for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) prophylaxis.
   Methods: We performed a systematic search (Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) for randomized controlled trials that compared the antiemetic efficacy of combining one of the 5-HT with droperidol or dexamethasone vs 5-HT alone. Relevant endpoints were prevention of early (0 to 6 hr), and overall (0 to 24 hr) PONV, and side effects. The articles that could meet the inclusion criteria were scored for inclusion and methodological validity using the three-item, five-point, Oxford-scale. Relative risk and numbers needed-to-treat with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for each combination vs 5-HT alone. The two combinations were then indirectly compared. A random effects model was used.
   Results: We considered 41 trials for analysis but subsequently excluded eight. Thirty-three trials with data from 3,447 patients were analyzed. Except for early nausea with the 5-HT plus droperidol, both combinations were significantly more effective than 5-HT in preventing early and overall PONV There was no difference in antiemetic efficacy between the two combinations. The incidence of commonly reported side effects was also similar in the two combination groups.
   Conclusion: We conclude that there is no statistically significant difference in antiemetic efficacy or side effects profile when one of the 5-HT is combined with either droperidol or dexamethasone and that both combination regimens are significantly more effective than 5-HT alone.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Satisfactory functional results following ossicular chain reconstruction mainly depend on a stable connection between the tympanic membrane and the stapes, which is in turn dependent on the type of prosthesis used. Knowledge about the safety and functional outcome of the commercially available middle ear prostheses is therefore of great importance.
   OBJECTIVE To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Kurz TTP-Variac System partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) in ossiculoplasty.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Retrospective review of all ossiculoplasties performed by 1 surgeon at a secondary referral center from August 2006 through July 2012. Participants were patients with cholesteatoma, chronic otitis media, or ossicular chain disruption in the absence of inflammatory disease who underwent ossicular reconstruction.
   EXPOSURE Ossiculoplasty using a Kurz TTP-Variac System PORP.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps (ABGs) and improvements in ABG were analyzed for each frequency by means of a 4-frequency pure-tone average. Successful postoperative hearing was defined as postoperative ABG smaller than 20 dB.
   RESULTS Eighty-nine ears in 83 patients aged 7 to 85 years were included. Transmeatal tympanoplasty was performed in 17 ears (19%). Seven ears (8%) underwent tympanoplasty with canal wall-down mastoidectomy, and 65 ears (73%) underwent canal wall-up (combined approach) tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy. The study population comprised 61 primary tympanoplasties (69%) and 28 revision cases (31%). Mean follow-up was 13 months. Overall, the ABG significantly improved from a mean (SD; range) of 26.19 (11.53; 3.75-51.25) dB to 15.58 (9.80; 0-48.75) dB (P < .01 for all frequencies). Mean ABG improvement was 10.62 dB. Successful postoperative hearing was obtained in 65 ears (73%). Revision surgery, especially in ears with ossicular chain disruption without inflammatory disease, was associated with poorer functional outcome, whereas preservation of the malleus was associated with a better functional outcome (P <.05). There were few complications (1 prosthesis extrusion, 2 prosthesis dislocations, 2 reperforations, 3 cases of residual cholesteatoma, and 3 of light sensorineural hearing loss).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The titanium Kurz TTP-Variac System PORP is an effective prosthesis to reconstruct the ossicular chain. Complications are rare, illustrating the safety of the prosthesis.

AB  - This work examines the application possibilities of the panoramic visualization system (HD-PVS) in ENT surgery. The HD-PVS is a new optical system that is neither an endoscope nor a microscope. It has a focal length of 200 mm and a wide field of view.
   The analysis of the visualization quality took place under laboratory conditions at 4 close-to-surgery scenarios with a total of 40 result values. Furthermore, the system was used for 45 operative procedures on patients (tympanoplasty, parotidectomy, neck dissection, septumplasty, transfacial approaches). The results were analyzed following the ICCAS workflow-scheme and with standardized questionnaires.
   The analysis of the visualization quality of the PVS exhibited the best total evaluation in 2 out of 4 scenarios, in 1 scenario HD-PVS attained the maximum score possible, as did the microscope and the endoscope was better than HD-PVS in 1 scenario. The microscope was never evaluated as being better than HD-PVS. Apart from its use in middle ear surgery, the HD-PVS can be considered operational in 4 out of 5 clinical applications with only slight modifications.
   The advantages of HD-PVS over gold standards such as the surgical microscope are lower initial costs for the optical system with frequently already existing HD-video system, smaller space requirements, equal or sometimes better visualization quality, possibility of videoendoscopic representation of surgery and better ergonomic conditions.

AB  - This study was undertaken to assess dysgeusia in patients who have undergone middle ear surgery for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) when the surgeon's practice was to cleanly divide the chorda tympani without prior manipulation, if it in any way hindered operative access or the aims of surgery. We wanted to determine whether lower rates of taste disturbance might be obtained by early, clean division of the nerve. We followed 110 patients prospectively and asked them to complete a postoperative dysgeusia questionnaire 1 year after surgery. The "cut nerve" group included 81 patients, and the "uncut nerve" group included 29 patients. In the uncut group, the nerve was untouched or underwent minimal handling. In the cut nerve group, 68% of patients had no taste disturbance after surgery; 4% of patients in this group had ongoing symptoms at 1 year postoperatively. In the uncut nerve group, 67% were asymptomatic, while 11% had ongoing taste disturbance at 1 year. Statistical analysis of symptoms beyond 1 year showed a mean difference of 7%, but this is not statistically significant (p = 0.38). These results suggest that early division of the chorda tympani without prior manipulation in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media does not result in higher rates of taste disturbance than in patients with uncut nerves. Indeed rates of taste disturbance in our cut group were lower than in the uncut group, and lower than or comparable to those seen in other studies.

AB  - Conclusion: The incidence of taste disturbance after stapes surgery is high (61.9%), whereas the majority (94.8%) recovers within 1 year. More severe surgical nerve trauma caused more disturbance, implying that the nerve should be handled carefully during surgery.
   Objectives: Patients operated on for otosclerosis seem more often to complain about post-operative taste disturbance than those operated on for chronic otitis media, although the chorda tympani nerve more seldom becomes maltreated in stapedotomy. These observations seem paradoxical. It is unclear to what extent a post-operative taste disturbance affects the quality-of-life. This study aims to shed light on the occurrence of post-operative taste disturbances, on possible prognostic factors, and to what extent post-operative taste disturbance impairs the quality-of-life.
   Methods: One hundred and thirty-four adults undergoing primary stapedotomy were included. Questionnaires on taste disturbance and quality-of-life (SF-36) were answered before and after surgery, until 1 year post-operatively.
   Results: Eighty-three (61.9%) study persons reported post-operative taste disturbance. Seven (5.2%) reported persisting disturbance at 1 year. Surgically more traumatized chorda tympani nerves correlated with more severe taste disturbance post-operatively than less traumatized. Taste disturbance at 1 year post-operatively correlate with a decrease of the physical function domain in the SF-36.

AB  - Absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam) has been used for many years in middle ear surgery. Although the sponge is generally well tolerated, fibrosis occasionally forms in the mesotympanum some studies indicated that the absorbable gelatin sponge may be responsible. Many of these studies lack statistical analysis. We prospectively studied three absorbable hemostatic agents in the middle ear of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to determine which promotes fibrosis to the greatest degree: absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam), absorbable gelatin sheet (Gelfilm), or absorbable collagen sheet (Instat). The materials were implanted in the middle ear through a post-auricular approach and the temporal bones were serially harvested at different time intervals so we could examine histologic changes. The nonimplanted ear served as surgical control. Examination of the specimens at 6, 8, and in weeks by light microscopy revealed that although absorbable gelatin film and collagen-absorbable hemostat are well tolerated in this animal model, absorbable gelatin sponge promoted the presence of fibrosis to a significantly greater degree, (p = 0.0344). We conclude that absorbable gelatin sponge promotes fibrosis more frequently than do collagen-absorbable hemostat and absorbable gelatin film in this animal model.

AB  - Background: The optimal timing for surgery to promote postoperative recovery in children with congenital stenosis of the external auditory canal with external auditory canal cholesteatoma, who are susceptible to exudative inflammation of middle ear and mastoid process, is still uncertain.Objectives: To investigate the treatment of congenital stenosis of external auditory canal with external auditory canal cholesteatoma complicated with exudative inflammation.Material and Methods: A retrospective analysis of 45 patients with congenital stenosis of external auditory canal with external auditory canal cholesteatoma complicated with mastoiditis. Based on whether effusion had resolved at the time of surgery, the patients were divided into two groups. Pure-tone audiometry tests were performed before and after surgery for both groups.Results: The average postoperative duration of dry ear was 36.38 days in Group 1 and 47.90 days in Group 2 (p < 0.05). Among patients who underwent hearing reconstruction, the average air conduction threshold decreased by 15-36 dBHL in Group 1 and by 7-22 dBHL in Group 2 (p < 0.05).Conclusions and significance: The postoperative outcomes of dry ear and hearing improvement can be enhanced by performing operation after effusion resolution in cases of congenital external auditory canal stenosis with external auditory canal cholesteatoma exudative inflammation.

AB  - Conclusion: Most of the clinical cases experienced taste disturbance after stapes surgery, and in a few cases this disturbance persisted for a long time. The animal experiment suggested the role of geniculate ganglion (GG) cells in nerve generation. Objectives: To clinically examine taste disorder and its recovery after stapes surgery and experimentally demonstrate a role of GG. Patients and methods: Taste function after preservation of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) in stapes surgery was prospectively investigated with a questionnaire and electrogustometry (EGM). Further, expression of neurotrophic factors in GG after injury of CTN was examined by in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISSH) and RT-PCR. Results: Among the cases, 15/18 (83.3%) were associated with taste disturbance and 6/18 (33.3%) were associated with tongue numbness 2 weeks after surgery; however, the symptoms ceased in 14/18 cases (77.8%). Two weeks after surgery, the EGM threshold was found to be elevated in 15/18 cases (83.3%), while in 10/18 cases (55.6%), it did not decrease until I year after surgery. Expression of ISSH and amplified bands of BDNF and GFR increased at 7 and 14 days after nerve injury in ipsilateral GGs and also increased at 7 days on the contralateral side.

AB  - Aim: The present study is a prospective study that looks into the prevalence of chorda tympani nerve injury and related symptoms following varying degrees of trauma to the nerve during four common types of middle-ear operations; namely, Tympanomastoid operations, myringoplasty, Tympanoplasty and Exploratory tympanotomy. Materials and Methods: 178 patients who underwent middle ear cleft surgery were included in this prospective study. Childrens below 20 years and patients with other potential cause of taste disturbance were excluded. Patients were given a single questionnaire, so as to assess their post-operative taste disturbance. Patient name, Age, Sex, Type of middle ear surgery, side of surgery were recorded. Any change in sense of taste immediately (after 2-4 weeks) or delayed (2-3 years)were recorded. Results: The number of patients with Chorda tympani nerve-related symptoms varied widely between these four groups. Increased occurrence of the nerve related symptoms were observed in Tympanomastoid and Myringoplasty, and a prolonged recovery time were observed in the tympanomastoid group. Stretching of the nerve produced more symptomatic cases than thermal injury or drying. Conclusion: It is important to inform patients about the possibility of Chorda Tympani Nerve injury during middle-ear operations, and it should also be emphasized that symptoms related to Chorda Tympani Nerve injury can occur irrespective of the type of damage to the nerve.

AB  - Objective: There is a general opinion that cartilage grafting in type-1 tympanoplasty has better anatomical outcomes when compared with fascia and perichondrium. But, regarding functional outcomes, however, although the literature is mainly in agreement about acceptable hearing gains, there is an on-going dispute on this matter. The aim of this study was to evaluate anatomical and functional outcomes in type-I tympanoplasty according to grafting materials.
   Methods: In this study, 154 cases who had undergone type-I tympanoplasty over a period of nine years were enrolled and divided into three groups according to graft type: i.e., fascia, perichondrium and cartilage. Pure tone audiometry was reviewed pre-and post-operatively (one year after surgery) for functional outcomes. The average air-bone gap (ABG) and air-conduction gain (ACG) were also determined pre-and post-operatively for each case. Tympanic membrane perforation was documented in terms of involved percentage and site.
   Results: A significant difference in air conduction gain between cartilage and other grafts (perichondrium (p<0.001), fascia (p<0.001)) was found, while no difference was found between fascia and perichondrium (p=0.720). There was no significant difference between groups in terms of anatomical outcomes (p=0.615).
   Conclusions: The majority of relevant studies are retrospectively designed, leading to a graft selection bias, while the impact of the site and size of perforation, which may have a confounding effect, is not taken into account. In this study, graft selection bias was eliminated by determining the distribution of the perforation site and size on a group basis. A comparable anatomical, but decreased functional, outcome for cartilage grafting when compared with TMF and perichondrium was revealed.

AB  - Background: Tympanoplasty is routinely done under local anaesthesia with sedation due to various advantages. Systemic analgesics and sedatives are generally given to improve the patient comfort. Aim & Objectives: To determine the effectiveness of combination of midazolam and butorphanol for sedation and to assess the sedation technique using midazolam and butorphanol for tympanoplasty under monitored anaesthesia care. Material and Methods: One hundred patients scheduled for tympanoplasty under local anaesthesia were given bolus doses of intravenous midazolam 0.03 mg/kg and butorphanol 0.03 mg/kg followed by midazolam infusion at 0.01 mg/kg/hr. If required, additional bolus doses of 0.01 mg/kg of both midazolam and butorphanol were given to achieve desired sedation and analgesia. The total dosage of midazolam and butorphanol, vital parameters, sedation score using Ramsay sedation score, pain score and surgeon satisfaction score using Numeric rating scale were recorded. Results: Ninety nine patients underwent tympanoplasty satisfactorily with sedation technique. Only one patient needed conversion to general anaesthesia. The mean duration of surgery was 92.7 +/- 8.16 minutes. The total midazolam and butorphanol dosages were 2.45 +/- 0.233 mg and 1.65 +/- 0.179 mg respectively. The desired Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) of 3 and pain score Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) = 2.82 +/- 0.72) were achieved within 4-8 minutes. No side effects of excessive sedation were observed. Conclusion: Combined use of midazolam and butorphanol in low doses produces adequate sedation for tympanoplasty under local anaesthesia without serious adverse effects.

KW  - Four point scale
KW  - Rescue medication
AB  - Introduction: Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV) is defined as any nausea or vomiting that occurs during the first 48 hours after surgery. It is considered as a distressing event following anaesthesia. The incidences of PONV is 25-30% in all post-surgical patients and the incidence of PONV with middle ear surgeries are 50%-80%. Various pharmacological techniques were used to prevent PONV. Five-HT3 receptor antagonists are most commonly used prophylactic agents.
   Aim: To compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous Palonosetron 75 mcg, and intravenous Dexamethasone 8 mg in preventing PONV.
   Materials and Methods: Hundred patients of 18-60 years undergoing ear and nose surgeries under general anaesthesia requiring intubation for more than one hour were randomised into two groups of 50 patients each. Group P received 75mcg of palonosetron and Group D received 8 mg of dexamethasone before induction. The incidence of PONV in the two groups was noted using a four point score until 24 hours postoperatively.
   Results: The overall incidence of PONV in 0-24 hours were maximum in the dexamethasone group with 50% and 20% in palonosetron group. The four point score was higher in dexamethasone group compared to palonosetron group & with statistically significant difference. The requirement of rescue antiemetic medication was 30% in dexamethasone group and 10% in palonosetron group.
   Conclusion: Our study has shown that palonosetron is more effective in the prevention of PONV without apparent side effects.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to describe the use of the endoscopic-assisted cochlear implantation in cases with an unsuccessful standard surgical technique because of not achieving adequate exposure to the round window (RW). Three patients with a bilateral profound hearing loss were operated using an endoscopic-assisted cochlear implant procedure at our tertiary university referral center between 2012 and 2014. In all of the patients, a retroauricular "c" shaped incision was performed and a subperiosteal pocket was created. Standard cortical mastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy were accomplished using a otomicroscope. However, RW and promontory could not be seen using this approach. The tympanomeatal flap was elevated and the middle ear cavity was entered A rigid 0 degree endoscope (2.7 mm wide, 18 cm in length) (Karl Storz company, Tuttlingen, Germany) and a connected HD camera system (Karl Storz Company, Tuttlingen, Germany) were used to expose RW through posterior tympanotomy, and a drill was passed through the external ear canal. The RW niche was removed using a diamond burr under endoscopic view; the endoscope was placed through the external ear canal, and electrodes were transferred through posterior tympanotomy. The electrodes were fully inserted under the endoscopic view in all cases. Endoscopic-assisted cochlear implantation may be a safe alternative surgical technique in cases where surgeons are not able to visualize RW and promontory using a microscope.

AB  - Objective: The purposes of this study were to determine the prevalence of abnormalities in the mastoid cavity and middle ear in a nonotolaryngologic population and to correlate the results with clinical data.
   Design: Prospective, cross-sectional study.
   Setting: An academic tertiary care centre.
   Methods: We evaluated 100 adults and 30 children from May to July 2003. Patients who had a history of mastoid or middle ear surgery or were presently suffering from otitis media were excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted for the suspected intracranial pathology.
   Main Outcome Measures: The T-2-weighted image was reviewed. The abnormality detected by MRI was divided into (1) mastoid cavity abnormality and (2) middle ear abnormality. All patients were asked to complete a questionnaire pertaining to the symptoms of the mastoid or middle car pathology and the history of the otitis media. Also, their ears were examined carefully by an otoscope or otomicroscope.
   Results: In both groups, most of the abnormalities were found in the mastoid cavity. Analysis of the clinical data revealed that abnormal MRI findings of the mastoid cavity were significantly correlated to clinically significant mastoid or middle ear disease in adults.
   Conclusions: Incidental MRI abnormalities in the mastoid cavity and middle ear detected in a nonotolaryngologic population were relatively uncommon compared with incidental paranasal sinus abnormalities. However, clinicians should remember the possibility of the pathologies that demand active treatment among these abnormalities, especially when a high signal abnormality is found in the mastoid cavity of an adult.

AB  - Objective: To date, all the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) applications have managed to stimulate the inner ear indirectly. Our objective was to present a new VSB application for direct inner ear stimulation.
   Study Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Settings: Tertiary, referral center
   Patients: Three patients with previous middle ear surgery and moderate-to-severe ipsilateral, mixed hearing loss.
   Interventions: Oval window membrane vibroplasty (OWMV) for direct acoustic cochlear stimulation. A total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) was attached to the floating mass transducer (FMT). Then, the stapes footplate was perforated, and the tip of the FMT-TORP assembly was advanced approximately 1 mm into the inner ear. A silicon ring was placed around the TORP's tip to prevent it from slipping deeper into the inner ear.
   Main Outcome Measure: Audiologic assessment involving pure-tone audiometry, aided and unaided free-field audiometry, Freiburg monosyllabic word test, and registration of any complications.
   Results: OWMV resulted in an average functional hearing gain of 36.1 dB (range, 24.2-47.5 dB). Although the greatest amplification was observed in the higher frequencies, there also was a significant improvement in the lower frequencies. The surgery was not related to any difficulties; vertigo, inner ear trauma, or further complications did not occur.
   Conclusion: We present a new method for direct acoustic cochlear stimulation using an active middle ear implant. The preliminary results show that OWMV is a promising and safe option for treating moderate and severe hearing loss, even in challenging cases with previous middle ear operations or fixed stapes footplate.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to establish whether there is an obvious difference between intact mucosa and abraded mucosa of the middle-ear cavity in respect to the potential side effects from the application of absorbable gelatine sponge (Gelfoam) and to investigate if Gelfoam combined with corticosteroid ointment (cortimycine, sterile 1% hydrocortisone acetate) can reduce the occurrence of these effects. Twenty Albino rats were used in the study. These animals were divided into four groups, with ten ears in each group. In group A, the middle-ear mucosa was kept intact, and Gelfoam was inserted into the middle-ear cavity. In group B, the middle-ear mucosa was abraded, and Gelfoam was inserted. In group C, Gelfoam with corticosteroid was implanted over the intact mucosa, and in group D, the mucosa was abraded prior to the insertion of Gelfoam with corticosteroid. The changes were evaluated 8 weeks postoperatively. In group A, there was a minimal increase in fibroblastic activity, vascular proliferation with mild to moderate fibrosis and all but two tympanic membranes were perfectly normal. However, in group B, we encountered a significant increase in fibroblastic activity, vascular proliferation and fibrosis, and we observed that all tympanic membranes were moderately to severely thickened. These histopathologic changes related to Gelfoam were noted to be decreased in group C and especially in group D. As previously reported in the literature, Gelfoam was found to promote the formation of connective tissue in the middle-ear cavity regardless of the status of the mucosa. The unwanted effects of this material may be decreased if it is combined with corticosteroids in the middle-ear cavity.

AB  - IMPORTANCE With the international spread of exclusive transcanal endoscopic ear surgery, the need for a suitable and affordable surgical training model has grown during the past years.
   OBJECTIVE To develop and validate an ex vivo animal model for exclusive endoscopic ear surgery.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND ANIMAL MODELS In an experimental study, we compared ovine and human middle ear anatomy in 4 specimens and assessed the lamb as a model for endoscopic ear surgery. After confirming its suitability, we developed a surgical training program for canaloplasty, myringoplasty, and ossiculoplasty. From March 1 to May 31, 2016, the ex vivo model was tested, assessing the time needed for dissection and complications. Each experience was subjectively validated on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suitability of the lamb model for training in exclusive endoscopic ear surgery.
   RESULTS We assessed the suitability of our novel lamb model on 20 ovine middle ears. All interventions could be performed in a satisfactory manner. The mean (SD) time required to perform canaloplasty was 29.7 (13.2) minutes, for middle ear dissection was 7.7 (2.6) minutes, for myringoplasty was 7.7 (4.3) minutes, and for ossiculoplasty was 10.4 (2.7) minutes. The time required for canaloplasty and tympano-meatal flap elevation during dissection decreased from 46.4 minutes in the first 5 cases to 16.2 minutes in the last 5 cases, representing an absolute difference of 30.2 minutes (95% CI, 22.28-38.12). Subjective ratings revealed excellent values for tissue quality (8.9 points of 10), overall satisfaction (8.3 points), and the learning experience (8.8 points).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The ovine model is suitable for endoscopic ear surgery. We describe a novel, exclusively endoscopic approach in an ex vivo animal model for middle ear surgery. The proposed surgical program leads the trainee step by step through the main otologic procedures and is able to enhance his or her surgical skills.

AB  - Introduction: Knowledge about the physiology of a healthy middle ear is essential for understanding the activity and mechanics of the ear as well as the basics of ossiculoplasty. Trauma of the epithelial lining of the tympanic cavity as well as the ossicular chain may be the result of chronic inflammation and surgery. Depending on the observed changes of the middle ear lining, there are several types of distinguished chronic inflammatory changes: simple, with cholesteatoma, with the formation of inflammatory granulation tissue, in course of specific diseases.
   Purpose: The aim of the article is presentation of the microstructure and vasculature of the ossicular chain in the Scanning Electron Microscope. Particular attention is drawn to the anatomical aspects of the structure and connections of auditory ossicles as vital elements for reconstruction of the conduction system of the middle ear.
   Material and method: The analysis covered auditory ossicles standardly removed in accordance with the methodology of the investigated surgical procedures. The preparations were evaluated in a scanning electron microscope.
   Results: The exposure of bone surface promotes deep erosion. The advanced process of destruction of bone surface in the case of chronic otitis media correlates with a significant degree of damage to both the lining covering the auditory ossicles and that surrounding articular surfaces.
   Conclusions: (1) The ossicles in the image of the Scanning Electron Microscope are covered with lining. It passes from the surface of the ossicles to the vascular bundles, forming vascular sheaths; (2) Damage to lining continuity on the surface of the auditory ossicles promotes the rapid destruction of bone tissue in the inflammatory process; (3) The dimensions of the individual ossicles are respectively: malleus - 8.36 +/- 0.01, incus - 8.14 +/- 0.0, stapes - 3.23 +/- 0.01 mm. Behavior of the anatomical length of ossicular chain during tympanoplasty appears to be essential to maintaining adequate vibration amplitude of the conductive system of the middle ear.

AB  - Background: With regard to its favorable physical properties, silicon nitride ceramic is considered as biomaterial for human medical application. Minor controversy exists about the biocompatibility of the material.
   Methods: Cytotoxicity testing, cell viability and morphology assessment was performed applying the L929-mice fibroblast cell culture model in a direct contact assay. Testing materials were silicon nitride ceramics of different surface properties and titanium alloy as a reference. Polyvinylchloride served as a negative control. The cells were stained with bisbenzimide and propidium iodine for double fluorochromasia viability testing, and evaluated by inversion-fluorescence microscopy. Scanning electron microscopy was applied to additionally investigate cell morphology.
   Results: No cytotoxic effects were observed on the silicon nitride ceramic samples; moreover cell morphology remained the same as on titanium. Avital cells were present exclusively on PVC. The cell growth in the silicon nitride samples showed no significant differences compared to titanium. Cell counts on all polished surfaces showed significantly higher numbers. Scanning electron microscopy revealed typical fibroblast morphology with filiform extensions.
   Conclusion: The current results indicate a favorable biocompatibility of silicon nitride ceramic. Cell growth, viability and morphology are comparable to parameters of titanium. Polished surfaces appear to promote cell growth. Further in vivo studies are mandatory prior to human medical application. Owing to its favorable physiochemical properties, especially its superior resistance to mechanical stress, silicon nitride could serve as a biomaterial for osteosynthesis of bone with mucosal attachment.

AB  - Hypothesis: The aim of this study was to measure the mass loading effect of an active middle-ear implant (the Vibrant Soundbridge) in cadaver temporal bones.
   Background: Implantable middle ear hearing devices such as Vibrant Soundbridge have been used as an alternative to conventional hearing aids for the rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss. Other than the obvious disadvantage of requiring implantation middle ear surgery, it also applies a direct weight on the ossicular chain which, in turn, may have an impact on residual hearing. Previous studies have shown that applying a mass directly on the ossicular chain has a damping effect on its response to sound. However, little has been done to investigate the magnitude and the frequency characteristics of the mass loading effect in devices such as the Vibrant Soundbridge.
   Methods: Five fresh cadaver temporal bones were used. The stapes displacement was measured using laser Doppler vibrometry before and after the placement of a Vibrant Sound-bridge floating mass transducer. The effects of mass and attachment site were compared with the unloaded response. Measurements were obtained at frequencies between 0.1 and 10 kHz and at acoustic input levels of 100 dB sound pressure level. Each temporal bone acted as its own control.
   Results: Placement of the floating mass transducer caused a reduction of the stapes displacement. There were variations between the bones. The change of the stapes displacement varied from 0 dB to 28 dB. The effect was more prominent at frequencies above 1,000 Hz. Placing the floating mass transducer close to the incudostapedial joint reduced the mass loading effect.
   Conclusion: The floating mass transducer produces a measurable reduction of the stapes displacement in the temporal bone model. The effect is more prominent at high frequencies.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the audiological, surgical, quality of life, and quality of sound outcomes in adults with open cavities implanted with the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) implant using round window (RW) vibroplasty approach.
   Study Design Retrospective study.
   Setting Otolaryngology department, tertiary referral hospital.
   Subjects and Methods Twelve adult patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss, all with previous middle ear surgery, underwent RW vibroplasty in an open cavity. Compound action potential thresholds were assessed during surgery. Surgical complications were recorded. Subjective benefit was evaluated using the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire (NCIQ), Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), and Hearing Implant Sound Quality Index (HISQUI(29)) tests.
   Results Mean follow-up was 42 months (range 12-76). There was no significant change in bone conduction thresholds after surgery. Mean functional gain was 34.3 dB and speech discrimination score at 65 dB significantly improved from 14 to 83%. Extrusion of the wire link was the main surgical complication in four patients. All NCIQ domains improved after surgery. All patients had a positive overall GBI score (mean 35.0). Mean HISQUI(29) score was 152.8, on average the quality of sound being defined as very good.
   Conclusion VSB is an effective method of hearing restoration for adults with open cavities suffering from conductive or mixed hearing loss. Intraoperative electrocochleography may be considered of significant help to check the coupling to the inner ear. The high rate of extrusion suggests that middle ear obliteration may be considered in these patients.

AB  - Purpose: Compare the outcomes of primary exclusive endoscopic ear surgery with those of the microscopic ear surgery in a group of patients affected by attic cholesteatoma.
   Materials and methods: Eighty patients suffered from attic cholesteatoma. Forty patients surgical treated with endoscopic ear surgery and forty patients surgical treated with microscopic ear surgery.
   Results: No statistical differences were found in the parameters analysed (frequency of facial nerve dehiscence, age, disease duration, site of dehiscence) between the endoscopic and microscopic groups indicating a homogenebus selection thus providing a good comparison of the outcomes between the two groups. None of the patients in our survey developed postoperative iatrogenic facial palsy. Graft success rate was 100% in both groups. The overall operation time of endoscopic ear surgery presented a mean value of 87.8 min, while in the group of patients treated via microscopic ear surgery a lower mean value of 69.9 min was reported.
   The average healing time was 36.3 days for the endoscopic subgroup and 47.8 days for the microscopic subgroup.
   Conclusion: The surgical outcomes of endoscopic ear surgery are comparable to those of the conventional approach in terms postoperative air-conduction, graft success rate and taste sensation. The analysis of postoperative pain and healing times showed better results for EES. The mean operative times of endoscopic ear surgery gradually shortened as the surgeons gained expertise in performing one-hand surgery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the results of partial and total ossicular reconstruction prostheses entirely made of hydroxylapatite.
   Study Design: A retrospective review of cases followed-up between 1997 and 2000.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: One hundred adult patients (60 men and 40 women) were studied. The mean age was 55 years (range, 25 to 65 years). Fifty patients had a previous tympanoplasty. The series included 45 cholesteatomas (45%), 37 chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma (37%), 13 retraction pockets (13%), and 5 posttraumatic ossicular displacements (5%).
   Intervention: A one-stage ossiculoplasty with a partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (n = 65) or a total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (n = 35) was performed. This was associated with a simple mastoidectomy in 70 cases and a radical mastoidectomy in 10 cases.
   Main Outcome Measures: All patients were followed-up at 1 year, and 50 were reexamined 2 years after surgery. Clinical and audiometric data were collected in a database at each visit.
   Results: A prosthetic extrusion was noted in two cases (2%). A prosthetic displacement occurred in 10 cases (10%). A revision surgery was carried out in 10 cases because of an ossiculoplasty failure or a disease recurrence. At I year, the residual air-bone gap was lower in cases with a partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis than those with a total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (16 +/- 9.3 versus 23 +/- 13.7 dB, p < 0.05). The gain in mean air conduction threshold was 21 +/- 12.8 dB in cases of partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis and 19 +/- 11.3 dB in cases of total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (not significant). Revision surgery, canal wall-down mastoidectomy, or cholesteatoma yielded poorer functional results.
   Conclusion: Partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis and total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis entirely made of dense hydroxylapatite yielded high rates of air-bone gap reduction and high anatomic stability.

AB  - Background and Purpose Diffusion-weighted imaging(DWI) in MRI has been developed as an important tool for the detection of cholesteatoma. Various DWI sequences are available. This study aims to evaluate the importance of the observer's reliance level for the detection of cholesteatoma. Methods Forty patients meeting the following criteria were included in the study: (1) chronic otitis media, (2) preoperative MRI including various DWI sequences, and (3) middle-ear surgery. The MRI protocol contained the following sequences: (1) axial and (2) coronal echoplanar imaging (EPI) readout-segmented (RESOLVE) DWI with Trace acquisition and (3) coronal non-EPI half-Fourier acquired single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) DWI. Cholesteatoma diagnosis was based on standard diagnostic criteria for cholesteatoma with DWI. Additionally, the radiologists were asked to grade personal reliance on their diagnosis using a Likert-type scale from 1 = very insecure to 5 = very secure. Results Axial and coronal RESOLVE DWI showed a sensitivity of 77.3% and a specificity of 72.2%, respectively. The mean reliance was 3.9 for axial and 3.8 for coronal images. HASTE DWI had a sensitivity/specificity of 81.8%/66.7% with the highest reliance of all evaluated sequences (4.4). Cases with a reliance level of 5 showed a sensitivity/specificity of 100% in all sequences. A reliance level of 5 was given in the axial and coronal RESOLVE DWI in 32.5% of cases and in the HASTE DWI in 57.5%. Conclusion The evaluated DWI sequences showed comparable results. The reliance level significantly improved the predictor of cholesteatoma disease with MRI techniques.

AB  - Purpose To report our experience in performing cochlear implantation under local anesthesia in a group of patients who were deemed unfit for general anesthesia. Methods A retrospective chart review was performed to analyze undesirable events and any other discomfort complained by patients during cochlear implantation. Analysis of patient's satisfaction was performed by means of a survey instrument. We have also compared the duration of surgery and hospitalization time with a control group that was implanted under general anesthesia. Result Twenty-one cochlear implantation in 20 patients were performed under local anesthesia. Age of patients ranged from 38 to 85 years. All interventions were successfully completed without any conversions to general anesthesia. Discomfort during surgery was reported in five cases: vertigo triggered by electrode insertion in two patients, pain during the round window approach in two patients and distress during the use of drill in one case; no patient experienced agitation. During the postoperative period, no complications or unpleasant experiences were reported. Only two patients stated that they would not perform cochlear implantation again under local anesthesia. Lower duration surgery and hospitalization time were found in the local anesthesia group. Conclusion Local anesthesia with conscious sedation is a safe and effective alternative for cochlear implant candidates considered unfit for general anesthesia. Fundamental for a successful procedure are preoperative counselling, accurate selection of the patients and constant intraoperative assistance. Unfeasibility of facial nerve monitoring and minor detrimental effect on training are the principal disadvantages in performing cochlear implantation under local anesthesia.

AB  - Objectives To assess the efficacy of avoiding mastoid pressure dressing (MPD) on children as a means of preventing discomfort and post-operative pain. Design A retrospective controlled study. Setting All operations were carried out by experienced surgeons using standard techniques, whose custom, not the gravity of any individual case, dictated the use of MPD. Participants Children who underwent mastoidectomy for inflammatory middle ear diseases at a tertiary centre from 2010 to 2021. Main Outcome Measures Wound-related complications and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain scores at discharge were compared between children who had an MPD applied following surgery and those who did not. Results One hundred thirty-five cases were included. The demographic characteristics of the patients and surgical techniques employed were similar for both groups. There were 91 patients in the MPD group and 44 in the non-mastoid dressing (NMPD) group. In the MPD group, five patients developed minor wound dehiscence, eight experienced surgical site infections (SSI), and one patient developed a keloid. In the NMPD group, one patient had an SSI, one patient suffered from a keloid scar, wound dehiscence was observed in one patient, and another one had a local hematoma. Therefore, there were no differences between the groups in relation to post-operative complications (p = .32). Despite these similitudes, the NMPD patients suffered less post-operative pain, as measured by the VAS (p = .02). Conclusion This study shows that no significant benefit is derived from using an MPD after mastoidectomy in children. Surgeons should adhere to principles of appropriate haemostasis and wound closure to prevent post-operative wound complications. Our study supports the abandonment of routine MPD in children following mastoidectomy.

AB  - Background and Objective Inner ear malformations (IEMs) are common in children with hearing loss. The different types of IEMs form a unique subgroup of cochlear implant (CI) candidates. We aimed to evaluate the auditory perception outcomes of CI in children with different types of IEMs and compare them with CI users without IEMs. Methods The study included 274 CI users with and without IEMs as two groups (n = 137, each). Both groups' chronological age at implantation and duration of CI usage was matched (+/- 8 months). All subjects were evaluated pre-operatively and post-operatively by the Ling's sound test and the auditory perception test battery, which includes the Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS), closed-set Pattern Perception Test (PPT) and open-set Sentence Recognition Test (SRT). Besides, children with IEMs were assessed for language development. Results Progress in the IEMs' group differed according to the type of ear anomaly. CI users with enlarged vestibular aqueduct had the highest scores, while users with common cavity had the lowest. Children with IEMs performed well on the closed-set test while having difficulty with the open-set test. Conclusion Cochlear implantation outcomes are favourable in IEMs' patients with a cochlear nerve visible on magnetic resonance imaging. Our results indicate that it is critical to take the anatomical differences into account during follow-up and rehabilitation programmes. Each CI user should be evaluated according to his or her individual needs.

   Study Design Descriptive design (survey).
   Setting Academic health center.
   Methods A 10-question survey was designed to identify level of training, scope of practice, specific otologic surgeries where monitoring was most used, and the opinion of respondents regarding the use of FNMs as standard of care for chronic and/or middle ear surgery. A randomized list of 2000 board-certified members of the American Academy of OtolaryngologyHead and Neck Surgery was generated. One thousand subjects received a mailed survey with a self-addressed return envelope and 1000 subjects received an emailed survey through Surveymonkey.com.
   Results There were 359 (36%) surveys returned by mail and 258 (26%) surveys returned electronically. Forty-three percent of respondents were in private practice, and 31% were fellowship trained in otology/neurotology. Sixty-five percent used a FNM in their training and 95% had regular access to a FNM. Revision mastoid surgery, cholesteatoma, canal wall down mastoidectomy, and facial recess approach were the settings where a FNM was most used. Forty-nine percent of respondents felt that a FNM should be used as the standard of care in chronic ear surgery; this represents an increase from 32% in a similar study done approximately 10 years ago.
   Conclusion There is a growing trend for routine facial nerve monitoring in the setting of chronic ear surgery.

AB  - PurposeTo develop and validate a bleeding score that could be applied in endoscopic ear surgery (EEarS).MethodsA prospective validation study was performed. A new bleeding score, called Modena Bleeding Score (MBS), was created by the authors. It provides five grades for rating the surgical field during EEarS procedures (from grade 1no bleeding to grade 5bleeding that prevents every surgical procedure except those dedicated to bleeding control). A preliminary face validity was performed by 18 ENT specialists to assess possible misunderstandings in interpreting the scale. Then, 15 videos of endoscopic ear surgery procedures, each divided into three parts (t0, t1, and t2), were subsequently evaluated by 15 specialists, using MBS. The videos were randomly selected and assigned. Intra-rater reliability and inter-rater reliability were calculated. The clinical validity of the instrument was calculated using a referent standard (i.e., four ENT experts whose ratings were compared to those obtained by the former sample).ResultsThe face validity showed a good consensus about the clarity and comprehension of the scale; both intra and inter-rater reliability demonstrated good performance (intra-rater reliability ranged from 0.741 to 0.991 and inter-rater reliability was 0.790); clinical validity also showed positive values, ranging from 0.75 to0.93.ConclusionsMBS has proved to be an effective method to rate surgical field during EEarS, with good-to-excellent performances. Its use would possibly help comparisons of groups in clinical trials or comparisons between studies.

AB  - Surgery on the temporal bone is technically challenging due to its complex anatomy. Precise anatomical dissection of the human temporal bone is essential and is fundamental for middle ear surgery. We assessed the possible application of a virtual reality temporal bone surgery simulator to the education of ear surgeons. Seventeen ENT physicians with different levels of surgical training and 20 medical students performed an antrotomy with a computer-based virtual temporal bone surgery simulator. The ease, accuracy and timing of the simulated temporal bone surgery were assessed using the automatic assessment software provided by the simulator device and additionally with a modified Final Product Analysis Scale. Trained ENT surgeons, physicians without temporal bone surgical training and medical students were all able to perform the antrotomy. However, the highly trained ENT surgeons were able to complete the surgery in approximately half the time, with better handling and accuracy as assessed by the significant reduction in injury to important middle ear structures. Trained ENT surgeons achieved significantly higher scores using both dissection analysis methods. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in the results between medical students and physicians without experience in ear surgery. The virtual temporal bone training system can stratify users of known levels of experience. This system can be used not only to improve the surgical skills of trained ENT surgeons for more successful and injury-free surgeries, but also to train inexperienced physicians/medical students in developing their surgical skills for the ear.

AB  - IntroductionIn recent years, there has been an increasing use of otoendoscopy in middle ear surgery. There is also increasing evidence of its usefulness as a diagnostic tool for clinicians. However, there is limited evidence on whether understanding their ear condition is of benefit to patients. This novel study sought to explore the perceptions, perspectives, and satisfaction of parents, children, and young people regarding the use of otoendoscope images in outpatient ENT consultations in relation to their understanding of ear symptoms, disease, and subsequent treatment. The framework for the study is child (and parent) health literacy and how visual images can play in scaffolding understanding, communication, and decision-making.MethodsThis qualitative descriptive exploratory study used semi-structured observation, a survey, short conversational interviews, and child activities.ResultsPurposive sampling of 16 children (aged 4-15 yrs, various diagnoses) and parents/carers attending an outpatient ENT clinic at a tertiary pediatric hospital. One overarching theme, "Grounding perceptions and deepening engagement," and two sub-themes, "Strengthening understanding" and "Supporting decision-making," were identified. The children and parents valued the opportunity to see the images and gain insight and knowledge of their child's pathology.DiscussionThe images appeared to promote child (and parent) health literacy and interaction between the child-parent-clinician and informed shared decision-making. This study suggests that the use of otoendoscopy in an out-patient setting and sharing of the images with parents, children, and young people have a largely positive impact on understanding, relationship building, and decision making in pediatric ENT consultations.

AB  - Aim: Cochlear implantation is a standard surgical procedure, with great benefit to the patient. However, according to recent studies, the function of vestibular system may be affected after surgery. The aim of the study was to investigate vestibular function in patients before and after cochlear implantation. Patients and methods: We examined a total of 10 patients before surgery, 1 day after surgery, and 14 days after surgery. As a control group, we examined 10 patients before and after middle ear surgery. To investigate the functions of the vestibular system, we used the Dizziness Handicap Inventory questionnaire and examination of the perception of subjective visual vertical. Results: According to the questionnaire, none of the patients reported dizziness before surgery. In the early stage after cochlear implantation, four patients experienced dizziness in the overall mild handicap score and after 14 days, dizziness persisted in one patient. The perception of the subjective visual vertical before surgery was above the norm in four patients. In the early phase after the surgery, the results were above the norm in nine patients. After 14 days, average results were above the norm values in three patients. In the control group, patients did not report dizziness and there was not any difference in perception of the subjective visual vertical. Conclusion: These findings confirm that objective examination after cochlear implantation showed deviations from the norm, but subjective complaint resulting from malfunction of vestibular system were minimal.

AB  - Objective: Understand opioid-prescribing patterns in otologic surgery and the difference in opioid use between transcanal and postauricular surgery. Study Design: Prospective survey. Setting: Multihospital network. Patients: All patients undergoing otologic surgery from March 2017 to January 2019. Intervention: Patients undergoing otologic surgery were surveyed regarding postoperative opioid use and their level of pain control. Patients were divided by surgical approach (transcanal vs. postauricular). Those who underwent mastoid drilling were excluded. Narcotic amounts were converted to milligram morphine equivalents (MME) for analysis. Main Outcome Measures: Amount of opioid was calculated and compared between the two groups. Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square testing were used for analysis. Results: Fifty-five patients were included in the analysis; of these 18 (33%) had a postauricular incision. There was no difference in age (p = 0.85) or gender (p = 0.5) between the two groups. The mean amount of opioid prescribed (MME) in the postauricular and transcanal groups was 206.4 and 143 (p = 0.038) while the mean amount used was 37.7 and 37.5 (p = 0.29) respectively. There was no difference in percentage of opioid used (p = 0.44) or in patient-reported level of pain control (p = 0.49) between the two groups. Conclusion: Patients in both the transcanal and postauricular groups used only a small portion of their prescribed opioid. There was no difference in the amount of opioid used or the patient's reported level of pain control based on the approach. Otologic surgeons should be aware of these factors to reduce narcotic diversion after ear surgery.

We also examined the primary factor behind postoperative pain looking at: 1) the surgical incision; 2) bone removal; and 3) number of involved middle ear regions.Results:One-hundred-and-six patients underwent TEES and 55 underwent MES. The mean pain NRS for the 7-day postoperative period was significantly lower for the TEES group (1.1) than the MES group (2.8) (p<0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The number of times a NSAID was taken was lower for the TEES group (1.3pills/wk) than the MES group (5.5pills/wk) (p<0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The mean pain NRS of the TEES and MES subgroups also suggests that extent of bone removal or number of involved middle regions was less important in causing postoperative pain than presence or absence of the retroauricular incision.Conclusions:TEES is associated with lower postoperative pain and lower use of NSAIDs compared with MES patients.

AB  - PurposeHearing rehabilitation through middle ear surgery can be challenging, particularly for patients with chronic otitis media, but new hearing devices offer opportunity to reach this goal. The aim was to compare hearing outcomes and quality of life in patients who were converted from a Baha Attract system to the Osia system.MethodsProspective observational study, in which each subject acted as their own control. Six patients who were converted from a Baha Attract to an Osia system performed audiometric and quality of life assessments with different sound processor at fitting, 3, 6 and 12 months. The speech performance in noise with the Osia system at 12 months, expressed as dB SNR, was compared to the baseline condition (Baha 5).ResultsThe PTA4 hearing thresholds improved from 42.6 & PLUSMN; 11 with Baha 5 Power to 34.8 & PLUSMN; 13.3 with Baha 5 SuperPower and to 25.4 & PLUSMN; 3.5 with the Osia at 12 months, leading to a significant functional gain of 17.2 & PLUSMN; 10.9 dB vs Baha 5 (p < 0.02). Speech understanding in both quiet and noise was clinically improved reaching a mean SNR of less than 1 dB at 12 months with the Osia system. Quality of life outcomes improved by more than 20% at 12-month follow-up.ConclusionAided hearing thresholds and speech understanding in noise improved when patients were converted from the Baha Attract system to the Osia system. The aided hearing threshold was maintained up to 8 kHz (26 dB) with the Osia system.

AB  - Background and objectives: It is crucial to decrease bleeding during functional endoscopic sinus surgery. Our primary goal was to investigate the effects of magnesium sulfate and dexmedetomidine used for controlled hypotension on the visibility of the surgical site.
   Methods: 60 patients aged between 18 and 65 years were enrolled. In the magnesium sulfate group (Group M), patients were administered 40 mg/kg magnesium sulfate in 100 mL saline solution over 10 min as the intravenous loading dose 10 min before induction, with a subsequent 10-15 mu g/kg/h infusion during surgery. In the dexmedetomidine group (Group D), patients were administered 1 mu g/kg dexmedetomidine in 100 mL saline solution as the loading dose 10 min before surgery and 0.5-1 mu g/kg/h dexmedetomidine during surgery. Deliberate hypotension was defined as a mean arterial pressure of 60-70 mmHg.
   Results: Bleeding score was significantly decreased in Group D (p = 0.002). Mean arterial pressure values were significantly decreased in Group D compared to that in Group M, except for the initial stage, after induction and 5 min after intubation (p < 0.05). The number of patients who required nitroglycerine was significantly lower in Group D (p = 0.01) and surgeon satisfaction was significantly increased in the same group (p = 0.001). Aldrete recovery score >= 9 duration was significantly shorter in Group D (p = 0.001). There was no difference between the two groups in terms of recovery room verbal numerical rating scale.
   Conclusions: Dexmedetomidine can provide more effective controlled hypotension and thus contribute to improved visibility of the surgical site. (C) 2014 Sociedade Brasileira de Anestesiologia. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda. All rights reserved.

   METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted at our institution on patients diagnosed with chronic otitis and then treated with type 1 tympanoplasty surgery between January, 2013 and January, 2014 . The patients were divided into two groups; group 1 consisted of patients who underwent endoscopic tympanoplasty and group 2 consisted of patients who underwent microscopic tympanoplasty. At follow-up 3, 6 ,and 12 months after surgery patients were asked to complete a questionnaire that enquired about symptoms of CTN injury: changes in taste sensation, tongue numbness. and dry mouth.
   RESULTS: There were 66 patients (33 males, mean age 30.4 +/- 8.14 years (range: 8-56 years)) There were 25 patients in group I (endoscopic tympanoplasty) and 41 patients in group 2 (miscroscopic tympanoplasty). A total of 11 (166%) patients reported symptoms related to CTN damage: 1 (4%) patient in group and 10 (24%) patients in group 2. A metallic taste in the mouth was the most-common symptom, noted by 7 patients(63.6%), 1 (4%) in group 1 and 6(14.6%) in group 2. Ageusia/hypogeusia was reported by 4 patients (37.4%) all in group 2 Tongue numbness occurred in 2 patients (4.8%) in group 2. No patients had xerostomia.
   CONCLUSIONS: Type I tympanoplasty performed with an endoscopic technique is minimally invasive,and is associated with less CTN manipulation and as a consequence less iatrogenic injury to the CTN

AB  - Hypothesis: The sensorineural hearing loss (HL) after middle ear surgery has been explained by the noise generated by drilling, without considering the vibration generated by the burr.
   Background: The role of temporal bone vibration in the etiology of the HL was evaluated.
   Methods: An electromagnetic shaker was used to vibrate the bony external ear canal of guinea pigs at different frequencies ranging from 32 to 1,000 Hz and at intensities ranging from 4.2 to 18.8 m/s 2 for 15 minutes. The hearing threshold was measured with auditory evoked responses. A total of 30 animals were tested.
   Results: After vibration, 60% of the guinea pigs developed a threshold shift (TS) exceeding 10 dB at two frequencies, with average TS of 8.8 dB across all frequencies and animals. The exposure to vibration at higher frequencies (range, 500-1,000 Hz) produced stronger TS than did the exposure to lower frequencies (range, 32-250 Hz). The v i bration- induced TS showed prominent recovery so that after 7 days, TS was 2.4 dB on average and 27 of 30 animals had recovered. After 14 days, the TS was 1.3 dB. The vibration excitation measurements showed that at lower frequencies, the vibration transmission into the skull was significantly greater than at higher frequencies, at which the transmission was heavily attenuated. There were no acoustic resonances detected in the skull. The frequency of vibration and the hearing frequency in auditory brainstem response were significant determinants in the model explaining the vulnerability of vibration on hearing. Hearing loss primarily occurred at higher frequencies. The HL was mostly reversible, consistent with the results observed after human temporal bone surgery.
   Conclusion: We conclude that in the guinea pig model, the temporal bone vibration at higher frequencies produced a more severe HL than did the vibration at lower frequencies, although the vibration at higher frequencies caused less efficient transmission from the vibrating probe to the temporal bone. The guinea pig model may be useful in the development of surgical techniques and in the understanding of temporal bone pathology.

AB  - Objective: A manipulation of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) is frequently necessary during the surgical therapy of stapedial ankylosis. The aim of this study was to re-assess the taste function before and after stapes surgery in patients with unilateral stapes ankylosis.
   Methods: Eighteen patients (14 female and 4 male) with unilateral stapedial ankylosis were included. Taste and olfactory function were measured preoperatively, 3 days and 3 months after surgery by questionnaire, chemical taste test, electrogustometry, and Sniffin'Sticks. The patients who reported deterioration in taste and revealed pathological taste test results were re-investigated 8-12 months after surgery. Postoperatively 11 patients were treated intravenously for 3 days for inner ear protection with 1 g of cortisone. The gustatory and olfactory results were compared with age and sex specific normative data.
   Results: A significant transient decrease of gustatory measurement values was found on the ipsilateral two thirds of the anterior tongue. 12 out of 17 patients whose CTN was slightly manipulated during stapes surgery reported tongue sensations, such as numbness or gustatory blindness of the ipsilateral tongue side. The measures of chemical taste test significantly decrease in lateralized taste test on the ipsilateral side and in whole mouth testing. There was no significant increase of the EGM measures at the ipslateral tongue. In 11 of 12 patients with symptoms, complaints recovered within one year after surgery completely. The factor "cortisone" did not have a significant effect on the taste test results after surgery.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, even after minor CTN manipulation the rate of postoperative taste disorders or tongue symptoms after stapes surgery is high. The symptoms appear to be transient. Therefore CTN should be preserved in stapes surgery after mild trauma of the CTN. Transient taste alteration should be mentioned prior to stapes surgery. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate stapes surgery in patients with otosclerosis and profound hearing loss. This means they meet hearing threshold criteria for cochlear implantation (CI). We performed a retrospective study and patient questionnaire. The results from 33 patients (35 ears) were recorded (mean age: 63.6, range: 40-85). The primary outcome measure was hearing thresholds recorded before and after surgery at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, and 4 kHz. Hearing thresholds at 2 and 4 kHz were also analyzed. Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) was used in 21 patients to assess life quality changes. Hearing thresholds improved in 80% of ears (mean improvement, 26.3 dB), were unchanged in 11.4%, and worsened in 8.6%. Mean GBI score was +20.7. Hearing aid use decreased in 23.8% and ceased in 28.6%. One patient subsequently underwent CI. For patients with profound otosclerosis, stapes surgery provides a quantitative improvement in hearing thresholds and improvement in quality of life, with reduced reliance on hearing aids. This avoids CI, auditory rehabilitation, and a change in quality and tonality of sound.

AB  - Objectives. This study was conducted to evaluate the user satisfaction, efficacy, and safety of round window (RW) vibro-plasty using the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) in patients with persistent mixed hearing loss after mastoidectomy. Methods. The study included 27 patients (mean age, 58.7 years; age range, 28-76 years; 11 men and 16 women) with mixed hearing loss after mastoidectomy from 15 tertiary referral centers in Korea. The VSB was implanted at the RW. The Korean translation of the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire and the Korean version of the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (K-IOI-HA) questionnaire were used to evaluate user satisfac-tion as the primary outcome. The secondary outcome measures were audiological test results and complication rates. Results. The mean scores for ease of communication (61.3% to 29.7% to 30.2%), reverberation (62.1% to 43.1% to 37.4%), and background noise (63.3% to 37.7% to 34.3%) subscales of the APHAB questionnaire significantly decreased after VSB surgery. The mean K-IOI-HA scores at 3 and 6 months after surgery were significantly higher than the mean preoperative score (18.6 to 27.2 to 28.1). The postoperative VSB-aided thresholds were significantly lower than the preoperative unaided and hearing aid (HA)-aided thresholds. There was no significant difference between preopera-tive unaided, preoperative HA-aided, and postoperative VSB-aided maximum phonetically balanced word-recogni-tion scores. None of the 27 patients experienced a change in postoperative bone conduction pure tone average. One patient developed temporary facial palsy and two developed surgical wound infections. Conclusion. RW vibroplasty resulted in improved satisfaction and audiological test results in patients with mixed hearing loss after mastoidectomy, and the complication rate was tolerable.

AB  - Background: The primary objective of this study was to analyse middle earstruc- tures critical for cochlear implantation using computed tomography. Materials and methods: Patients who underwent cochlear implantation at the Department of Otolaryngology in Szczecin between 2015 and 2022 were eligible for the study. We analysed computed tomography images of 57 ears in 52 patients. The following parameters were assessed: mastoid aeration, tegmen tympani height, sigmoid sinus position, posterior tympanotomy width, the distance between the facial nerve and chorda tympani, modified facial recess distance, and the prediction line described by other authors. Results: In 69% of patients, after the removal of the round window bony overhang, the round window membrane became fully visible. There were no statistically significant correlations found for parameters describing mastoid process anatomy or those rating the width of the posterior tympanotomy concerning round window access. The prediction lines, according to Kashio and Jwair, were found to be relevant. In cases where patients' access to the niche and membrane of the window was rated as good or very good during clinical evaluation, they were more likely to describe the window as being located posteriorly or medially in the radiological evaluation. Using a binary Jwair scale provided a better correlation with the clinical assessment. In cases where the windows were graded as posterior, the clinical assessment indicated better surgical access, especially to the RWM (Round Window Membrane). Conclusions: Evaluating middle ear anatomy on a computed tomography scan is useful for preparing for middle ear surgery but does not significantly affect the ability to access the round window. For such access, the position of the window in relation to the facial nerve is the most relevant factor, and measurements based on this relationship hold the highest clinical value.

AB  - Background The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the surgical training of residents. There is a real concern that trainees will not be able to meet their training requirements. Low-fidelity surgical simulation appears to be an alternative for surgical training. The educational benefits of repeating ossiculoplasty simulations under a microscope have never been evaluated. With this study we aimed to evaluate the differences in performance scores and on a global rating scale before and after training on an ossiculoplasty simulator. Methods In this quasi-experimental, prospective, single-centre, before-after study with blinded rater evaluation, residents performed five microscopic ossiculoplasty tasks with a difficulty gradient (sliding beads onto rods, the insertion of a partial prosthesis, the insertion of a total prosthesis, and the insertion of a stapedotomy piston under microscopic or endoscopic surgery) before and after training on the same simulator. Performance scores were defined for each task, and total performance scores (score/min) were calculated. All data were collected prospectively. Results Six out of seven intermediate residents and 8/9 novices strongly agreed that the simulator was an effective training device and should be included in the ENT residency program. The mean effect of training was a significant increase in the total performance score (+ 0.52 points/min, [95 % CI, 0.40-0.64], p < 0.001), without a significant difference between novice and intermediate residents. Conclusions This preliminary study shows that techniques for middle-ear surgery can be acquired using a simulator, avoiding any risk for patients, even under lockdown measures.

AB  - Objectives Chorda tympani nerve (CTN) function may be damaged more by two-stage than by one-stage surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma. However, few studies have reported the relationship between two-stage cholesteatoma surgery and CTN function. This study aimed to investigate CTN function after two-stage surgery for cholesteatoma. Methods In this prospective study, 35 patients underwent two-stage canal wall up tympanoplasty (CWUT). Perioperative CTN function was assessed using questionnaires and electrogustometry (EGM). Participants were categorized into minor, major, and section groups, based on the degree of CTN manipulation during surgery. Results In the first-stage surgery, posterior tympanotomy with an intact canal wall reduced the degree of CTN manipulation. The incidence of taste disorder after the first-stage surgery was 71.4%. Postoperative taste disorder and the EGM threshold improved early in the minor manipulation group. In the second-stage surgery, no new CTN damage occurred, even if this surgery involved removal of residual cholesteatoma. The incidence of taste disorder after second-stage surgery was less than that after first-stage surgery, independent of CTN preservation. However, the recovery rate of the EGM threshold after second-stage surgery was significantly lower in the section group than in those with CTN preservation. Conclusion CTN function, including symptoms and EGM threshold, can be preserved during two-stage cholesteatoma surgery if care is taken to preserve the CTN in both the first- and second-stage surgeries. A two-stage CWUT, ensuring an intact bony annulus, may be effective to facilitate CTN preservation. Level of Evidence 2b.

AB  - Objective A tube dysfunction is a common medical issue and can promote chronic otitis media. With the implementation of the Balloon dilation a treatment of the chronic tube dysfunction was set. In the present study significance of this method was assessed, especially questioning the success in practical terms of tympanic membrane retraction.
   Material and methods In a retrospective study, in a period of assessment from 2011 until 2016, the data of 81 patients, who underwent Balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube due to chronic tube dysfunction with regard to a preoperative presence of tympanic membrane retraction were evaluated. The success of the Balloon dilation was judged due to the capability of a postoperative SVT-Test and the patients' self-assessment. With an average postoperative period of four months, the data of 13 patients were analyzed based on presence of pre- and postoperative tympanic membrane retraction.
   Results The treatment occurred at all cases without complications. In patients with chronic tube dysfunction the method revealed an improvement of 46 %, while 31 % of the patients with tympanic membrane retraction showed an improvement of the middle ear ventilation. Subjectively perceived 54 % of the patients marked an improvement of their clinical symptoms.
   Conclusion In spite of a self-assessed improvement in 54 % only 31 % of the patients with chronic membrane retraction showed an objectively measurable success. To evaluate the question if combination with other middle ear surgeries shows better results, further studies, including more patients and data, are required.

AB  - To describe the in vivo vascularization of middle ear by an endoscopic point of view, particularly focusing on the medial wall of tympanic cavity and incudostapedial region (ISR).
   Case series with surgical videos review and anatomical description.
   48 videos from exclusive endoscopic middle ear surgery performed at the University Hospital of Modena from November 2015 to July 2017 were reviewed. Data about anatomy of vessels, and blood flow direction (BFD) were collected in an appropriate database for further analyses.
   48 cases were included in the present study. In 18/48 patients (37,5%), a clearly identifiable inferior tympanic artery (ITA) was present, running just anteriorly to the round window (RW), with a superior BFD (65% of cases) from the hypotympanic region toward the epitympanum. Some promontorial variants were described in 67% of cases and the most common finding was a mucosal vascular network with a multidirectional BFD. On the ISR, an incudostapedial artery (ISA) was detected in 65% of cases with BFD going from the long process of the incus (LPI) toward the pyramidal eminence in the majority of cases.
   The vascular anatomy and BFD of the medial wall of the tympanic cavity can be easily studied in transcanal endoscopy. ITA (with a superior BFD in most cases) and ISA (with a main BFD from the incus to the stapes) are the most constant identifiable vessels.

KW  - Myringoplasty
KW  - Chronic otitis media
KW  - Tympanic perforation
AB  - Background: Myringoplasty is one of the surgical techniques for the management of chronic suppurative otitis media with permanent perforation of tympanic membrane. It is defined as simple surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforation without doing ossicular reconstruction. The aim of this study is to analyze the anatomic and functional outcome of this procedure in our setting.
   Material & Methods: This descriptive study was conducted from October 2010 to October 2011, at DHQ and Al-Shifa Hospital Dera Ismail Khan. Patients with dry perforation for 6 weeks were included while those with any other associated ear pathology, prior ear surgeries or less than 5 years of age were excluded from the study. Informed consent was taken from all the patients. All patients were operated under microscope with underlay technique through postaural approach by single surgeon.
   Results: Total number of operated ears was 53. Mean age of the patients was 17.3+4.3 years; 28(52.83%) were males while 25(47.16%) females. The overall success rate of myringoplasty was 88.6% and 73.5% in terms of anatomical and functional outcomes respectively. No major complication such as worsening of hearing or dead ear was observed. Hematoma formation was seen in 12(22.6%) while wound dehiscence in 9(16.9%) patients.
   Conclusion: Myringoplasty is a safe surgical procedure in achieving intact tympanic membrane and to improve the hearing loss.

AB  - The aim of the study was to compare anatomical and functional outcomes of temporalis fascia graft versus tragal cartilage graft in type 1 tympanoplasty in paediatric patients.A prospective, comparative and randomised study. A detailed history was taken from all the patients visiting the ENT OP dept after fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criterion patients were enrolled for the study. Written and informed consent was taken for all the patients from legally acceptable guardians. Preoperative assessment was done and the patients were subjected to type1 tympanoplasty with Temporalis fascia graft or tragal cartilage graft. All the patients were followed up on the third, sixth postoperative months to assess hearing improvement. All the patients were followed up on the first and third,sixth postoperative months for graft status with otoscopic examination.In the present study out of 80 patients, 40 patients underwent type 1 tympanoplasty with temporalis fascia and the remaining 40 patients with tragal cartilage. Both groups were assessed postoperatively for anatomical and functional success with maximum follow up of six months. There was no statistical significance between the outcome and the age or site and size of tympanic membrane perforation. Both groups had comparable graft success rate and hearing improvement. The cartilage group had a higher anatomical success rate. The functional outcome was similar. However, there was no statistically significant difference found in the outcome of two groups. Tympanoplasty can be performed in a paediatric age group with a good success rate in suitable patients. It can be done at an early age,safely with good anatomical and functional outcomes. The age group, site or size of perforation, the type of graft used for tympanoplasty does not alter the anatomical or functional outcome significantly.

AB  - Introduction: Microsurgery of the ear requires complete evaluation of middle ear surgical anatomy, especially the posterior tympanic cavity anatomy. Preoperative assessment of the middle ear cavity is limited by the permeability of eardrum and temporal bone density. Therefore, middle ear exploration is an extremely useful method to identify structural abnormalities and anatomical variations.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to determine anatomic variations of the middle ear in an autopsy series.
   Methods: All evaluations were performed in the Forensic Medicine Institute Morgue Department. The cases over 18 years of age, with no temporal bone trauma and history of otologic surgery included in this study.
   Results: One hundred and two cadavers were included in the study. The mean age was 49.08 +/- 17.76 years. Anterior wall prominence of the external auditory canal was present in 27 of all cadavers (26.4%). The tympanic membrane was normal in 192 ears (94%) while several eardrum pathologies were detected in 12 ears (6%). Agenesis of the pyramidal eminence and stapedial tendon was found in 3 ears. While the ponticulus was bony ridge-shaped in 156 of 204 ears (76.4%), it was bridge-shaped in 25 ears (12.3%). The ponticulus was absent in 23 ears (11.3%). While complete subiculum was present in 136 of all ears (66.7%), incomplete subiculum was present in 21 ears (10.3%). Subiculum was absent in 47 ears (23%). Facial dehiscence was found in 32 ears and the round window niche was covered by a pseudomembrane in 85 ears (41.6%). A fixed footplate was present in 7.4% of all ears, and no persistent stapedial artery was seen in any cases.
   Conclusion: The pseudomembrane frequency covering the round window niche was found different from reports in the literature. In addition, the frequency of the external auditory canal wall prominence has been reported for the first time. (C) 2018 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial.

AB  - Background: Endoscopic ear surgery is an emerging technique with recent literature highlighting advantages over the traditional microscopic approach. This study aims to characterize the current status of endoscopic ear surgery in Canada and better understand the beliefs and concerns of the otolaryngology head 84 neck surgery community regarding this technique.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey study of Canadian otolaryngologists was performed. Members of the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology were contacted though an online survey carried out in 2015.
   Results: The majority of participants in this study (70 %) used an endoscope in their practice, with a large proportion utilizing the endoscope for cholesteatoma or tympanoplasty surgery. To date, 38 Canadian otolaryngologists (70 % of respondents) have used an endoscope for at least 1 surgical case, but only 6 (11 %) have performed more than 50 endoscopic cases. Of the otolaryngologists who use endoscopes regularly, the majority still use the microscope as their primary instrument and use the endoscope only as an adjunct during surgery. However, the general attitude surrounding endoscopes is positive; 81 % believe that endoscopes have a role to play in the future of ear surgery and 53% indicated they were likely to use endoscopes in their future practice. Participants who were earlier in their practice or who had more exposure to endoscopic techniques in their career were more likely to have a positive stance towards endoscopic ear surgery (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively). The main concern regarding endoscopic ear surgery was the technical challenge of one-handed surgery, while the primary perceived advantage was the reduced rates of residual or recurrent disease.
   Conclusions: Endoscopic ear surgery is a new technique that is gaining momentum in Canada and there is enthusiasm for its incorporation into future practice. Further investment in training courses and guidance for those looking to start or advance the use of endoscopes in their practice will be vital in the years to come.

AB  - Introduction: Surgery is still the method of choice in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. Except for some specific clinical situations, classic canal wall up technique (CWU), remains a gold standard as a primary treatment in most departments. Unfortunately, the risk of recurrence in such an approach is estimated at 9 to even 70%. This fact prompts researchers to look for ways to reduce those unfavourable statistics. One of the recognized methods supporting the removal of cholesteatoma is the intraoperative use of mesna (sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate). This synthetic sulphur compound disrupts disulfide bridges in polypeptide chains, thanks to which it facilitates matrix preparation.
   Aim: To evaluate the effect of intraoperative use of mesna on the treatment outcomes in patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma operated on by means of the canal wall up technique (CWU).
   Material and methods: 459 surgical reports of patients with middle ear cholesteatoma were analyzed. In total, 52 adult patients with no history of previous ear surgery operated on by means of the CWU technique by the same experienced otosurgeon with all follow-up data available were included in the study. Twenty-six were operated on with the use of mesna (mesna group) and 26 by means of the classic CWU technique (control / no-mesna group). There were 28 women and 24 men with a mean age of 41 years.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Postoperative hearing results and cholesteatoma recidivism rate.
   Results: Overall recidivism rate was 21.15 %. It was higher in the no-mesna (26.9%) than in the mesna group (15.4%) - although the outcomes were better in the mesna group, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.49715). Hearing gain was better in the mesna than in the no-mesna group (10 dB vs 7 dB), but the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.20089). Conclusions: Our preliminary results show that mesna reduces recidivism rates in patients with cholesteatoma. Further study with the analysis of a larger group of patients is needed to prove it statistically.

AB  - IntroductionPatients with otitis media (OM) encounter significant functional hearing impairment with conductive, or a combined hearing loss and long-term sequelae involving impaired speech/language development in children, reduced academic achievement and irreversible disorders of middle and inner ear requiring a long time therapy and/or multiple surgeries. In its persistent chronic form, Otitis media (COM) can often only be treated by undergoing ear surgery for hearing restoration. The persistent inflammatory reaction plays a major role, often caused by multi-resistant pathogens in the ear. Herein, we present outcomes of patients implanted with currently the only FDA approved active Middle Ear Implant Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB), suffering from persistent COM.MethodsThe study enrolled 42 patients, treated by performing middle ear (ME) surgery to different extents and implanted with the VSB to various structures in the ME. Included were 17 children and 25 adults that had recurrent and/or persisting OM and significant hearing loss. Preoperative and postoperative patients' audiometric data were evaluated and the benefit with VSB assessed using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory for adults and pediatric cohorts. The microbial spectrum of pathogens was assessed before and after surgery, exploring the colonization of the otopathogens, as well as the intestinal microbiome from individually burdened patients.ResultsThe mean functional gain is 29.7 dB HL (range from 10 to 56.2 dB HL) with a significant improvement in speech intelligibility in quiet. Following VSB implantation, no significant differences in coupling were observed at low complication rates. Postoperatively patients showed significantly increased benefit with VSB compared to the untreated situation, including less otorrhea, pain, medical visits, and medication intake, with no recurrent OM and significant bacterial shift in otopathogens. The analysis of the intestinal microbiome displayed a high abundance of bacterial strains that might be linked to chronic and persistent inflammation.ConclusionsFunctional ear surgery including rehabilitation with a VSB in patients suffering from COM present to be safe and effective. The successful acceptance accompanied by the improved audiological performance resulted in significant benefit with VSB, with a shift in the ear pathogens and altered microbiome and thus is a great opportunity to be treated.

   Aim: To compare the analgesic and sedative efficacy of two different loading doses of dexmedetomidine for tympanoplasty under MAC.
   Materials and Methods:Aftertaking ethical committee approval, patients were allocated into two groups of 40 each. Group I and Group II patients received injection dexmedetomidine at a loading dose of 1.0 mu g/kg and 0.5 mu g/kg respectively over 10 min followed immediately by a continuous infusion of 0.4 mu g/kg/h. Degree of sedation and pain intensity were assessed using Ramsay Sedation Score (RSS) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) respectively. Total rescue doses of Fentanyl and Midazolam as well as surgeon and patient satisfaction scores (Numerical Rating Scale NRS 0-10) were noted. Student t-test, paired t-test and chi-square test were used for statistical analysis.
   Results: Requirement of higher rescue doses of Fentanyl was more in Group II (100%) as compared to Group I (15.00%) (Z=61.760;p<0.001) and that of Midazolam was also more in Group II (92.50%) as compared to Group I (2.50%) (Z=65.234; p<0.001). Surgeon Satisfaction score was higher in Group I (8.75 +/- 0.54) than Group II (6.95 +/- 0.50) (Z= 7. 784;p<0.001). Patient Satisfaction score was also higher in Group I (8.70 +/- 0.56) than Group II (6.28 +/- 0.60) (Z=7.914; p<0.001). No postoperative complication was seen in any group.
   Conclusion: A loading dose of 1 mu g/kg of dexmedetomidine over 10 min provides better sedation, analgesia, patient satisfaction and surgeon satisfaction than 0.5 mu g/kg over 10 min without causing any per-operative problem and seems to be a safe and effective primary sedative technique for tympanoplasty under MAC.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the functional hearing results regarding speech perception and auditory sound localization in a high-resolution directional hearing setup following implantation with a new bone conduction device (MED-EL Bonebridge, Innsbruck, Austria). In addition, we assessed the patient acceptance of the Bonebridge system using a questionnaire. The study design is retrospective study. The setting is University Hospital Frankfurt. 18 patients implanted with a Bonebridge device from May 2012 to January 2015 were participated in this study. Speech perception in quiet was tested with the Freiburg monosyllable test at a presentation level of 65 dB SPL. Speech perception in noise was tested post-operatively with the Oldenburg sentence test (OLSA) in best-aided condition. We assessed auditory sound localization with a high-resolution directional hearing setup. To evaluate the acceptance by patients using the Bonebridge in daily life, we used a modified questionnaire. The overall average of functional hearing gain (n = 18) was 29.3 dB (+/- 20.7 dB). Speech perception of monosyllabic words in quiet improved by 20.7% on average, compared with the pre-operative aided condition. Mean speech reception thresholds (SRTs) of the Oldenburg sentence test (OLSA) improved significantly from -3.8 dB SNR (range -5.7 to 5.8 dB SNR) to -5.2 dB SNR (range -6.3 to -0.6 dB SNR) after implantation. Regarding localization abilities, no significant difference was found between the unaided and aided conditions following Bonebridge implantation. A survey of patients' acceptance and handling of the Bonebridge implant in daily life revealed high patient satisfaction. All patients accepted and benefited from the implanted system. No infections or adverse surgical effects occurred. Speech perception significantly improved in quiet and in noise. No significant difference in sound localization was observed. Acceptance of the Bonebridge implant, tested with a modified questionnaire, was high.

AB  - Background: Outpatient tympanomastoidectomy is common in many medical centers. However, failure of same-day discharge is often the result of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Many times this leads to hospital admission after tympanomastoidectomy, and it is often difficult to predict before surgery whether PONV will be an issue that impedes same-day discharge.
   Objective: To determine the clinical factors correlated with the incidence of PONV requiring hospital admission after chronic ear surgery by hypothesizing that the complexity of a particular case, as measured using a 10-point scale, is predictive of surgical time or failure of same-day hospital discharge.
   Study Design: Retrospective medical chart review of 103 patients having mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media over a 2-year period.
   Methods: We recorded patient age, clinical data, surgical times, types of agents used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, use of prophylactic antiemetic drugs, types and doses of analgesic agents, and PONV. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine which variables were associated with PONV that required hospital admission.
   Results: One third of patients studied were safely discharged from the hospital the day of surgery, and 92% were discharged within 23 hours. The most common cause for observation admission to the hospital was PONV. The only variable in multivariate analysis that significantly correlated with PONV mandating hospital admission after tympanomastoid surgery was a history of motion sickness or PONV (odds ratio, 5.21; P=.02). Although severity of disease did not correlate with length of hospital stay, it directly correlated with length of surgery.
   Conclusions: A history of PONV or motion sickness is predictive of PONV and length of hospital stay. Routine planning for a 23-hour overnight observation stay seems warranted for all patients undergoing tympanomastoidectomy, despite severity of disease.

AB  - Objectives: To assess the anatomic and functional outcome of underlay cartilage myringoplasty in children with cleft palate, at different postoperative periods compared with a patients-matched control group
   Study Design: Case control study, tertiary referral center.
   Methods: An otologic database was used to select children with cleft palate and perforated tympanic membrane who underwent myringoplasty between 1995 and 2012. These subjects were matched with control patients, without cleft palate, using the following criteria: age, size of perforation, status of contralateral ear, and status of middle ear mucosa. Charts were reviewed for the following: patients characteristics, preoperative findings, surgical data, postoperative anatomic and functional outcomes, and reinterventions. The postoperative findings were divided into 5 different periods.
   Results: A group of 32 cleft palate patients as well as 32 control patients were included in this study, with a mean follow up of 63.6 +/- 41 months. There were no differences between the groups in anatomic success as it was achieved in 84% in both groups. No differences were seen in functional outcome when compared with each different postoperative period. Using the last available audiogram, the postoperative mean air conduction and the airbone gap were significantly worse in the cleft group compared with the control group, respectively, 26.1 +/- 13.7 dB versus 18.4 +/- 10.1 dB, p = 0.042; and 16.5 +/- 9.4 dB and 11.3 +/- 6.4 dB, p = 0.046. Additionally, the functional success was significantly worse in the cleft group; 58% versus 87% in the control group (OR, 5.5 [95% CI, 1.22-24.81], p = 0.027).
   Conclusion: Children with cleft palate can benefit from cartilage underlay myringoplasty in terms of closure of tympanic membrane, although there is a worse functional outcome.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Methods A prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted. A total of 123 otosclerosis subjects were included in the study. The subjects were divided in three groups based on the following interventions: (a) stapedotomy without any prior hearing-aid rehabilitation (n = 60); (b) hearing-aid rehabilitation without any prior stapedotomy (n = 33); and (c) stapedotomy with prior hearing-aid rehabilitation (n = 30). Pre- and post-operative pure tone audiometry were measured. The Swedish version of the GBI was completed by the subjects 6 months after the intervention. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency, factor analysis, construct validity, and criterion validity, was assessed. Results The Swedish version of the GBI was well accepted by the subjects. It showed good psychometric properties with an overall high reliability. Factor analysis resulted in a 5-factor solution explaining 66.6% of the variance where factors 1 and 2 represented the general health domain. Conclusions Overall, the Swedish version of the GBI showed good psychometric properties. Based on the factor analyses, there is the possibility that the general health domain should be divided in two separate domains: general health and psychosocial health. Level of Evidence 2c.

AB  - Context Small-area variations in surgical rates raise concerns about access to care, treatment appropriateness, and the quality and cost of care.
   Objective To measure small-area variations in rates of myringotomy with insertion of tympanostomy tubes (TTs) and to identify determinants of rate variation.
   Design and Setting Retrospective analyses using hospital discharge data for patients who had undergone a myringotomy with insertion of TT by county in Ontario between April 1, 1996, and March 31, 1999. Information on possible determinants was taken from a survey of otolaryngologists and primary care physicians in 1996 and from the 1996 Canadian census and physician demographic databases for 1996-1999.
   Participants A total of 75 358 hospitalizations for TT placement of children and adolescents (aged less than or equal to 14 years).
   Main Outcome Measure Small-area variation in rates of TT.
   Results An almost 10-fold difference between the areas with the highest and lowest rates was found (extremal quotient, 9.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2-11.1; P<.001). Higher rates occurred in counties with higher percentages of high school graduates (parameter estimate, 0.01; 95% CI, 0-0.02; P=.049); and where referring physicians were more likely to be male (parameter estimate, 0.01; 95% CI, 0-0.02; P=.01), North American-trained (parameter estimate, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.01-0.02; P<.001), and have higher propensities to refer for surgery (parameter estimate, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.09-0.72; P=.02). Otolaryngologist opinion was not a significant predictor.
   Conclusion Substantial area variation in TT rates was observed. The opinion of primary care physicians was the dominant modifiable determinant, suggesting an area of research that may be important in reducing area variation in TT procedures.

TI  - EUSTACHIAN TUBAL FUNCTION IN NORMAL AND DISEASED EARS
T2  - ARCHIVES OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - A technique has been presented that attempts to quantitate the functional capacity of the eustachian tube by measuring the reduction of artificially produced intratympanic pressures that occurs when the eustachian tube opens during deglutition. The eustachian tubal function of normal ears and of ears with chronic suppurative otitis media were studied by this technique. Analysis of these initial data suggest the following preliminary conclusions. This technique is an accurate method of determining the degree of function of the eustachian tube as well as its anatomical patency. The minimal negative intratympanic pressure required for the passage of air through the eustachian tube during deglutition is the most significant of the various parameters of tubal function that have been measured with this technique. The normal eustachian tube will completely equalize positive or negative intratympanic pressures with the ambient pressure. It opens with every swallow with minus 250 mm water intratympanic pressure. The eustachian tubes of ears with chronic suppurative otitis media functioned less well as a group than those of normal ears, but within the group of diseased ears there is a wide spectrum of function ranging from normal to complete absence of function. The condition of the mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity appears to be the most important pathological factor associated with tubal function in ears with chronic suppurative otitis media. Tubal function in ears with a thickened and inflamed mucosa is subject to considerable change, poor function being often reversible with clearing of the inflammation of the mucous membrane. Furthermore, tubal function remains relatively constant in the presence of normal tympanic mucosa in which case poor function is unlikely to change. This technique promises to be an important diagnostic tool in the selection and timing of patients for reconstructive middle ear surgery which, to be successful, requires normal or near normal tubal function.

AB  - Objective: To present long-term results with a semi-implantable middle ear implant, the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB), and analyze pre- and post-operative results of audiologic tests.
   Study Design: Retrospective chart review with additional patient interview and audiologic testing.
   Setting: One tertiary referral center.
   Subjects: Twenty patients who met the selection criteria of the manufacturer were evaluated at least two years after implantation.
   Interventions: Monaural Implantation of the VSB in 20 patients. in two of these 20 patients implantation of the second ear in a second stage.
   Results: Assessment of benefit and satisfaction using the standardized International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids, the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, and Visual Analogue Scales in all patients. Fifteen patients agreed to undergo audiologic testing at follow-Lip including pure-tone- and speech audiometry in silence and noise. The majority of patients (13/20) reported to be satisfied or very satisfied with the VSB. Aided speech perception was comparable between the VSB and the hearing aid preoperatively. When compared to the preoperative audiograms, residual hearing from 0.5-4 kHz was significantly worse in the operated ear with 8 dB (Wilcoxon signed rank test p < 0.001) but only 2.6 dB in the non-operated ear (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p > 0.05). Major surgical complications did not Occur. Permanent alteration in taste occurred in three patients and revision surgery was necessary in another three patients.
   Conclusion: Satisfaction with the VSB was not Superior to conventional hearing aids in Subjective and in audiometric terms. Because of its impact on residual hearing and the requirement of implantation middle ear surgery, implantation of the VSB should be limited to patients with relevant side effects of hearing aids, e.g., severe chronic otitis externa.

AB  - Studies by laser-Doppler flowmetry of middle ear microcirculation changes induced by physical and chemical stimuli in the animal have only recently been made. This prospective study, performed in humans, was designed to compare the effects of a postural manoeuvre (headup tilt 30 degrees), hypotension and locally applied vasoconstriction on middle ear blood flow during anaesthesia. Circulatory changes provoked by a headup tilt of 30 degrees, and successive intravenous boluses of potent vasodilators, were compared with circulatory changes provoked by locally applied adrenaline, in ten healthy patients in good physical states undergoing middle ear surgical repair. Heart rate and direct arterial pressure were continuously recorded via a radial artery cannula. Middle ear blood flow was continuously recorded via a laser-Doppler probe placed on the promontorium cavi tympani. Metabolic parameters (partial pressure of O-2 and CO2 in arterial blood, pH, arterial lactate concentrations) and arterial concentrations of propofol were measured just before and just after the experiment. Headup tilt did not modify heart rate, mean arterial pressure or middle ear blood flow. Vasodilators (nicardipine, nitroprusside, nitroglycerin) provoked a fall in arterial pressure (P<0.0001, P<0.0001, P<0.019, respectively), but did not induce any significant variations in heart rate; variations occurred in middle ear blood flow (P>0.05, not significant) which were different according to patients and agents. Locally applied adrenaline provoked a fall in the middle ear blood flow (P<0.0012), with no effect on heart rate and arterial pressure. There were no significant changes in metabolic values, or propofol serum concentrations. The behaviour of the middle ear blood flow submitted to hypotension, posture, or to vasoconstriction could be related to counteracting regulatory responses and/or to direct vascular effects.

AB  - Background The intravenous anesthetic propofol is a gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptor agonist. Propofol promotes analgesia by depressing nociceptive transmission in peripheral neurons, antagonizing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and activating gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors in dorsal root ganglion receptor cells. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether intraoperative propofol causes clinically meaningful postoperative analgesia. We therefore tested the hypothesis that patients anesthetized with sevoflurane require a greater quantity of postoperative opioids (from the end of surgery until the next postoperative morning) than those anesthetized with propofol.
   Methods With Institutional Review Board and EudraCT Number approval (2009-011038-82) and patients' informed consent, ninety patients scheduled for open vein stripping were randomized to either sevoflurane or propofol anesthesia at the Medical University of Vienna General Hospital and the Danube Hospital, the largest regional hospital in Vienna. Pain was treated with bolus piritramide and patient-controlled morphine hydrochloride. The primary outcome was total opioid use from the end of surgery until the first postoperative morning. For the initial four postoperative hours and on the first postoperative morning, a blinded investigator recorded pain scores on an 11-point Likert verbal response scale.
   Results The median [interquartile range] morphine sulfate equivalents were 9.8 [4-19] mg in the sevoflurane group and 10 [6-20] mg in the propofol group. Sevoflurane was not superior to propofol on postoperative opioid consumption, giving a ratio of means of 0.91 (95% interim-adjusted confidence interval [CI], 0.33 to 2.45; P = 0.74). Additionally, no difference in pain scores was found over time between the two groups, with a mean difference on an 11-point scale of 0.20 (95% interim-adjusted CI, -0.36 to 0.73; P = 0.31).
   Conclusion Intraoperative sevoflurane did not reduce postoperative analgesia. This finding is consistent with the results in most previous reports. This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00712517.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to compare the outcome of endoscopic tympanoplasty with sterile acellular dermal allograft (ADA) and conventional endaural microscopic tympanoplasty with tragal perichondrium.& para;& para;Methods: This was a retrospective comparative study of 53 patients (25 males and 28 females) with tympanic membrane perforation who underwent type I tympanoplasty in the department of otorhinolaryngology at a tertiary medical center from March 2011 to April 2017. The subjects were classified into two groups; transcanal endoscopic tympanoplasty with ADA (TET, n = 26), conventional endaural microscopic tympanoplasty with autologous tragal perichondrium (EMT, n = 27). Demographic data, perforation size of tympanic membrane at preoperative state, pure tone audiometric results preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively, operation time, sequential postoperative pain scale, and postoperative graft failure rate were evaluated.& para;& para;Results: The perforation size of the tympanic membrane in TET and EMT group was 22.3 +/- 10.9% and 23.5 +/- 9.7%. respectively (P = 0.143). Mean operation time of EMT (92.3 +/- 16.5 min) was longer than that of the TET (65.3 +/- 20.5 min) with a statistical significance (P = 0.004). Graft success rate in the TET and EMT group were 92.3% and 96.3%, respectively; the values were not significantly different (P = 0.610). Pre- and postoperative audiometric results including bone and air conduction thresholds and air-bone gap were not significantly different between the groups. In all groups, the postoperative air-bone gap was significantly improved compared to the preoperative air-bone gap. Pain in the immediate postoperative and day 1 after surgery were significantly less in the TET group.& para;& para;Conclusion: With human cadaveric ADA, minimal invasive endoscopic tympanoplasty can be achieved with similar postoperative results and less pain.

AB  - Since Shea introduced stapedectomy as a surgical treatment of otosclerotic hearing loss in 1956, numerous ENT surgeons worldwide have used this procedure with great success. Over the years, many of them have contributed towards progressively improving and refining the surgical techniques. The retroauricular approach has been changed to the less invasive endaural approach, and today a large number of otologists routinely use the transcanal approach under local anaesthesia. The total removal of the footplate has been changed to the less traumatic small fenestra stapedectomy or stapedotomy, where, in a central footplate perforation, a piston of 0,3-0,8 mm diameter is fitted. Stapes prostheses in biocompatible materials such as titanium, gold, teflon and platinum have become available and are sometimes equipped with ingenious automatic fixation mechanisms. The microsurgical instrumentation has been gradually expanded. New technical tools, such as the minimally traumatic, ultra-light, low-speed skeeter microdrill, have been developed. Several lasers allowing a precise intervention on the stapes without mechanical trauma have been tried and applied with success. The optic quality of the operating microscopes has been increased. All of these advances have contributed to making stapes surgery an example for the concept of,,minimally invasive high success surgery". The aim of the present study is to analyze the recent progress in stapedectomy. The working basis is the body of literature mainly from the last 10 years as well as personal experience with ca. 700 stapedectomies performed with various surgical techniques (skeeter stapedotomy, argon laser stapedotomy by using a fiberoptic microhandpiece, erbium laser stapedotomy, laser stapedotomy with preservation of the stapes tendon, stapedotomies with piston insertion of various diameters, atypical stapedectomies with piston fixation on the malleus head, stapedectomy in middle ear malformation and abnormal courses of the facial nerve with piston insertion into the promontorium as well as techniques and results in stapes revision surgery).

AB  - We evaluated auditory performance following cartilage tympanoplasty for the management of tympanic membrane retraction pockets. We performed a 230-patient retrospective study over a 10-year period (1990-2000) and compared pre-operative and postoperative audiograms. Postoperative audiograms were better in 49% of cases, identical in 16% and worse in 11%. Cartilage tympanoplasty for the management of tympanic membrane retraction pockets has a good postoperative functional outcome. Cartilage graft is useful for reconstruction of the eardrum and tympanic bone defects.

AB  - Purpose Transcutaneous active bone conduction hearing aids represent an alternative approach to middle ear surgery and conventional hearing aids for patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss. The aim of this study was to determine quality of life, subjective hearing experience and patients' satisfaction after implantation of a bone conduction hearing aid. Methods This monocentric and retrospective study included twelve adult patients who received a bone conduction hearing aid (Bonebridge, MedEL) consisting of an extracorporeal audio processor and a bone conduction implant (BCI) between 2013 and 2017. On average 40 months after implantation, the patients were asked to answer three questionnaires regarding quality of life (AqoL-8D), self-reported auditory disability (SSQ-12-B) and user's satisfaction (APSQ) after implantation of the Bonebridge (BB). A descriptive statistical analysis of the questionnaires followed. Results 12 patients aged 26-85 years (sex: m = 7, w = 5) were recruited. The quality of life of all patients after implantation of the BB (AqoL 8D) averaged an overall utility score of 0.76 (SD +/- 0.17). The mean for 'speech hearing' in the SSQ-12-B was + 2.43 (SD +/- 2.03), + 1.94 (SD +/- 1.48) for 'spatial hearing' and + 2.28 (SD +/- 2.32) for 'qualities of hearing'. 11 out of 12 patients reported an improvement in their overall hearing. The APSQ score for the subsection 'wearing comfort' was 3.50 (SD +/- 0.87), 'social life' attained a mean of 4.17 (SD +/- 1.06). The 'device inconveniences' reached 4.02 (SD +/- 0.71) and 'usability' of the device was measured at 4.23 (SD +/- 1.06). The average wearing time of the audio processor in the cohort was 11 h per day, with 8 of 12 patients reporting the maximum length of 12 h per day. Conclusion BB implantation results in a gain in the perceived quality of life (AqoL 8D). The SSQ-12-B shows an improvement in subjective hearing. According to the APSQ, it can be assumed that the BB audio processor, although in an extracorporeal position, is rated as a useful instrument with positive impact on social life. The majority stated that they had subjectively benefited from BB implantation and that there were no significant physical or sensory limitations after implantation.

   Study Design A retrospective analysis of preoperative and postoperative hearing thresholds.
   Setting Tertiary referral center and teaching hospital.
   Patients One hundred sixty-three consecutive procedures of primary stapes surgery for clinically proven otosclerosis in 108 women and 55 men with an average age of 46 years.
   Intervention Stapedotomy and insertion of either a standard or a circumferential stapes prosthesis.
   Main Outcome Measures Four-frequency pure-tone average preoperative and postoperative air-bone thresholds were recorded. A secondary outcome measure was stability of the implant, as measured by failure rates.
   Results Success of closure of the air-bone gap to within 10 dB was achieved in 97% and comparable in both groups (original prosthesis, 23.6; standard deviation, 7.3, with the average reduction seen in the circumferential prosthesis group being 22.6, standard deviation, 5.6). All the differences were not statistically significant using two-way analysis of variance. Failure rate for the original piston was 6%, with no failures seen with the circumferential piston.
   Conclusion Both prostheses showed comparable postoperative hearing outcomes, with the circumferential prosthesis being found to be more stable.

AB  - This work examines the application possibilities of a new visualization system, the Panoramic Visualization System (HD-PVS), in ENT surgery. The Panoramic Visualization System (PVS) is a novel optical system that is neither an endoscope nor a microscope. It has a focal length of 200 mm, a wide field of view and is used together with an HD camera and an HD monitor (HD-PVS). The analysis of the visualization quality took place in laboratory conditions using 4 close-to-surgery scenarios with altogether 40 data points. Further, the system was used on patients in 45 procedures (tympanoplasty, parotidectomy, neck dissection, septumplasty, transfacial approaches). The results were analyzed following the ICCAS workflow-scheme and with standardized questionnaires. In the analysis of the visualization quality, the PVS exhibited the best total evaluation in the lab test in two out of four scenarios. In one of four scenarios, the PVS as well as the microscope achieved the maximum attainable score. In one out of four scenarios, the endoscope attained a better result than the PVS. The microscope was never superior to the HD-PVS in terms of image quality. In four out of five clinical applications, the PVS was evaluated as operational with slight modifications. Most development is needed in middle ear surgery applications. The remaining procedures already benefit in the system configuration examined here, and they were regularly accomplished with support of the PVS. The present study offers a good basis for introducing the PVS to ENT surgery. The advantages over the existing gold standard include lower initial costs for the optical system than for an operating microscope since the HD-video system is often already in place, smaller space requirements than a microscope, equal or at times better visualization quality than the microscope, the possibility of videoendoscopic representation of surgeries in which this was impossible before, and better ergonomic conditions.

AB  - Background: Chronic otitis media (COM) can be treated with tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy. In patients who have undergone middle ear surgery, three-dimensional spiral computed tomography (CT) scan plays an important role in optimizing surgical planning.
   Objectives: This study was performed to compare the findings of three-dimensional reconstructed spiral and conventional CT scan of ossicular chain study in patients with COM.
   Patients and Methods: Fifty patients enrolled in the study underwent plane and three dimensional CT scan (PHILIPS-MX 8000). Ossicles changes, mastoid cavity, tympanic cavity, and presence of cholesteatoma were evaluated. Results of the two methods were then compared and interpreted by a radiologist, recorded in questionnaires, and analyzed. Logistic regression test and Kappa coefficient of agreement were used for statistical analyses.
   Results: Sixty two ears with COM were found in physical examination. A significant difference was observed between the findings of the two methods in ossicle erosion (11.3% in conventional CT vs. 37.1% in spiral CT, P = 0.0001), decrease of mastoid air cells (82.3% in conventional CT vs. 93.5% in spiral CT, P = 0.001), and tympanic cavity opacity (12.9% in conventional CT vs. 40.3% in spiral CT, P= 0.0001). No significant difference was observed between the findings of the two methods in ossicle destruction (6.5% conventional CT vs. 56.4% in spiral CT, P = 0.125), and presence of cholesteatoma (3.2% in conventional CT vs. 42% in spiral CT, P = 0.172). In this study, spiral CT scan demonstrated ossicle dislocation in 9.6%, decrease of mastoid air cells in 4.8%, and decrease of volume in the tympanic cavity in 1.6%; whereas, none of these findings were reported in the patients' conventional CT scans.
   Conclusion: Spiral-CT scan is superior to conventional CT in the diagnosis of lesions in COM before operation. It can be used for detailed evaluation of ossicular chain in such patients.

AB  - Objective Middle ear cholesteatoma may lead to the erosion of the bony structures of the temporal bone, possibly causing intra- and extracranial complications. Surgical treatment is mandatory, and due to possible residual/recurrent disease, the use of reliable diagnostic methods is essential. Our study aimed to evaluate the reliability of non-EPI DW-MRI for the follow-up of cholesteatoma after surgery. Methods In a study group including 53 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for cholesteatoma at a tertiary university hospital, an imaging protocol was applied, including non-echo planar diffusion-weighted imaging magnetic resonance (MR) at 1 month after surgery and then at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Based on the combination of preoperative assessment and intraoperative findings, the study group was divided into 3 subgroups: petrous bone (PB) cholesteatoma, complicated cholesteatoma and uncomplicated cholesteatoma. PB cholesteatoma patients were treated by a subtotal petrosectomy, whereas complicated and uncomplicated cholesteatoma patients were treated either by a canal wall up procedure or a retrograde (inside-out) canal wall down technique with bone obliteration technique (BOT). Results The results show that patients who had positive findings on non-EPI DW-MRI scans 1 month after surgery consequently underwent revision surgery during which residual cholesteatoma was noted. All the patients who displayed negative findings on non-EPI DWI-MRI scan at 1 month after surgery did not show the presence of a lesion at the 6- and 12-month evaluations. The 6 patients who displayed residual cholesteatoma at the 1-month follow-up presented dehiscence/exposure of the facial nerve canal at the primary surgery, mostly at the level of the labyrinthine segment. Conclusion Non-EPI DW-MRI is a useful and reliable tool for follow-up cholesteatoma surgery, and when applied early, as was done in the protocol proposed in the present study, this tool may be used to detect the presence of residual cholesteatoma in some patients, prompting the planning of early revision surgery.

AB  - Background: With the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), a validated measurement instrument for the assessment of disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been available internationally since 2000. The aim of this study was to provide a validated German version of this international instrument and to compare it with the German Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15). Methodology: The CES was translated into German via a forward-backward translation process. For validation, 79 patients with COM undergoing middle ear surgery were prospectively included. HRQoL was determined preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively using the CES and the COMOT-15. Pure tone audiometry was also performed at both measurement time points. In the control examination, an additional retrospective assessment of the preoperative situation was additionally performed using the CES and the COMOT-15 to assess the response shift. The determined psychometric characteristics were internal consistency, test-retest reliability, discrimination validity, agreement validity, responsiveness, and response shift for both measurement instruments. Convergent validity of both measurement instruments was assessed using linear regression. Results: On the basis of the CES, patients with COM could be reliably distinguished from patients with healthy ears. The CES showed satisfactory reliability with high internal consistency (Cronbach a 0.65-0.85) and high retest reliability (r> 0.8). The global assessment of HRQoL impairment correlated very well with the scores of the CES (r= 0.51). In addition, it showed a high sensitivity to change (standardized response mean -0.86). Compared to the COMOT-15, it showed a lower response shift (effect size -0.17 vs. 0.44). Both measurement instruments correlated only slightly with air conduction hearing threshold (r= 0.29 and r= 0.24, respectively). The concordant validity of both measurement instruments was high (r= 0.68). Conclusion: The German version of the CES shows satisfactory psychometric characteristics, so that its use can be recommended. The CES focuses on the influence of ear symptoms on HRQoL, whereas the COMOT-15 also includes functional and psychological aspects. Due to only minor response shift effects, the CES is particularly suitable for studies with multiple repeat measurements.

AB  - None of the available antiemetics is entirely effective, perhaps because most of them act through the blockade of one receptor. There is a possibility that a combination of antiemetics with different sites of activity would be more effective than one drug Alone for prophylaxis against postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV).
   The clinical use of combined traditional antiemetics, including antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine), butyrophenones (e.g. droperidol) and benzamides (e.g. metoclopramide), for the prevention of PONV is limited because of the possibility of additive central nervous system toxicity, such as delayed emergence, drowsiness and extrapyramidal reactions. The efficacy of a combination of a serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (ondansetron, granisetron or tropisetron) and dexamethasone is superior to that of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists Alone for the prevention of PONV, suggesting that dexamethasone enhances the antiemetic efficacy of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. The combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a traditional antiemetic (droperidol, metoclopramide or promethazine) acting at a different emetogenic receptor is more effective in reducing the incidence of PONV than each antiemetic alone acting at one receptor site. The risk of undesirable adverse effects does not increase with the combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and a traditional antiemetic at the doses commonly used for PONV, because of the absence of drug interactions. The combination of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist (ondansetron) with other agents (propofol and CP-122721) reduces the incidence of PONV to a greater degree than monotherapy. However, no data are available for the combination of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and small doses of propofol for the prevention of PONV.
   Further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combination antiemetic regimens for PONV. Knowledge regarding combinations of these antiemetic drugs may be necessary to completely prevent PONV.

AB  - Introduction: Various graft materials have been used to close tympanic membrane perforations. In the literature, there are few studies in pediatric populations comparing different graft materials. To our knowledge, there is no reported study that measured the thickness of the tragal cartilage in pediatric tympanoplasties. The tragal cartilage is not of uniform thickness in every patient.
   Objective: To compare anatomical and functional outcomes of temporalis fascia muscle and full-thickness tragal cartilage in type 1 pediatric tympanoplasties.
   Methods: In total, 78 patients (38 males, 40 females; average age 10.02 +/- 1.98 years; range, 7-18 years) who underwent type 1 tympanoplasties in our clinic were included. Demographics, anatomical, and functional outcomes were collected. Temporalis fascia muscle and tragal cartilage were used as graft materials. Tragal cartilage was used without thinning, and the thickness of tragal cartilage was measured using a micrometer. Anatomical and functional outcomes of cartilage and fascia were compared. Audiometric results comparing the cartilage and fascia groups were conducted at 6 months, and we continued to follow the patients to 1 year after surgery. An intact graft and an air-bone gap <= 20 dB were regarded as a surgical success. Results with a p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
   Results: The graft success rate was 92.1% for the cartilage group compared with 65.0% for the temporal fascia group. In the fascia group, the preoperative air-bone gap was 33.68 11.44 dB and postoperative air-bone gap was 24.25 +/- 12.68 dB. In the cartilage group, the preoperative air-bone gap was 35.68 12.94dB and postoperative air-bone gap was 26.11 +/- 12.87 dB. The anatomical success rate in the cartilage group was significantly better than that for the fascia group (p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in functional outcomes between the fascia and cartilage groups (p> 0.05). The average thickness of tragal cartilage in the pediatric population was 0.693 +/- 0.094 mm in males and 0.687 +/- 0.058 mm in females.
   Conclusions: Our data suggest that the anatomical success rate for a cartilage tympanoplasty was higher than for a fascia tympanoplasty. Functional results with cartilage were not different than with fascia, even though we did not thin the tragal cartilage. However, further studies should focus on the interaction between the thickness of the tragal cartilage and the tympanoplasty success rate.

AB  - Background: The antihypertensive drug clonidine is a centrally acting alpha (2) agonist useful as a premedicant because of its sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. We examined the effect of clonidine given as an oral preanesthetic medication in producing a bloodless surgical field in patients undergoing middle ear microsurgery. We also evaluated whether the administration of clonidine would alter the reflex cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, anesthetic requirement, postoperative pain intensity and consumption of analgesics, and pre- and postoperative sedation and anxiety.
   Methods: A prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed in 40 patients scheduled for elective middle ear surgery under general anesthesia. Twenty-one patients received clonidine (300 mug p.o.) 90 min prior to arrival at the operating theater and 19 received placebo (control group). The hemodynamic endpoint of the anesthetic management was maintenance of hypotension for producing a bloodless surgical field. The desired control of the cardiovascular system was attained with isoflurane (inspired concentration increments of 0.25 vol% up to a maximum of 1.5 vol%)+/- fentanyl (bolus of 1 mug . kg(-1))+/- urapidil (bolus of 0.3 mg . kg(-1)) as needed. Intraoperative bleeding was assessed on a four-point scale from 0=no bleeding to 3=abundant bleeding.
   Results: There was less bleeding in the clonidine group (mean +/- SEM) than in the control group (0.75 +/-0.3 vs 1.1 +/-0.3 P <0.05). Patients given clonidine required a mean inspired isoflurane concentration of 0.63 +/-0.1 vol% as compared with 1.01 +/-0.2 vol% in controls (P <0.05). Fentanyl requirements were also significantly lower (57.10 vs 79.42 mug . kg(-1), P <0.05). Four clonidine-treated patients required urapidil to achieve satisfactory hypotension as compared with 11 controls (P <0.05). Clonidine attenuated the associated cardiovascular response following laryngoscopy and intubation, and was more effective than placebo in achieving a satisfactory preoperative sedation and decreasing intensity of postoperative pain. Preoperative anxiety and incidence of adverse events was similar in both soups.
   Conclusion: Premedication with clonidine reduced bleeding in middle ear microsurgery, attenuated hyperdynamic response to tracheal intubation, and reduced isoflurane, fentanyl, and urapidil requirements for controlled hypotension.

AB  - PurposeTo report the intraoperative observations and hearing outcomes in patients undergoing endoscopic revision ossiculoplasty.MethodsA retrospective cohort of patients who had undergone revision ossiculoplasty were enrolled in this study. Intraoperative findings were documented. Follow-up visits were scheduled from 3 to 12 months post-surgery to assess hearing levels and record any potential complications.ResultsBetween April 2020 and May 2023, a total of 26 cases were enrolled, with 11 male patients represented. The mean age of the patients was 40.5 +/- 9.4 years, ranging from 18 to 66 years. During the revision surgeries, various intraoperative findings were noted, including adhesive tissues affecting the activity of ossicular chain (observed in 37.0% of cases), tympanosclerosis of the ossicular chain (also in 37.0% of cases), dislocation of ossicular prosthesis (33.3%), erosion of the ossicular chain (33.3%), and identified cholesteatoma (11.1%). In terms of hearing outcomes, a significant improvement was observed. Overall, only 37.0% of patients achieved an air-bone gap of 20 dB or less, indicating the inferior outcome in revision ossiculoplasty.ConclusionsThis study highlight the role of inflammatory responses (adhesion, tympanosclerosis), stapes erosion, and prosthesis dislocation, as contributing factors to the failure of primary tympanoplasty. Endoscopic revision ossiculoplasty emerges as a reliable and effective approach.

In addition, it was determined whether the presence of granular and edematous mucosa in middle ear altered functional outcomes.
   Methods: Sixty patients, who had undergone CWDT with the use of TORP for the reconstruction of ossicular chain, were divided into two groups. Patients with cartilage shoe were classified as Group 1 (n=30) and those without the shoe were classified as Group 2 (n=30). Patients in both groups were classified into "A" and "B" subgroups according to the middle ear risk index (MERI). Air conduction (AC) and bone conduction thresholds were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively.
   Results: There was no statistically significant change between preoperative AC thresholds of the groups and subgroups (p>0.05). There were statistically significant differences regarding AC thresholds and air-bone gap (ABG) values between Groups 1 and 2 at the postoperative 12th month (p<0.05). Postoperative AC thresholds and ABG values of Group 1B patients with a high MERI score were statistically significant at all frequencies than those of Group 2B patients (p<0.05). When ABG values were compared, it was observed that functional results were better in Group 1B, but a statistically significant difference was observed only at 2000 Hz (p<0.01).
   Conclusion: The cartilage shoe method for titanium TORP stabilization that is used for ossicular reconstruction during CWDT has been found to have a beneficial effect on auditory outcomes. Cartilage shoe application increases positive effects on hearing outcomes, particularly if the middle ear mucosa is granular and edematous.

AB  - To observe and compare the functional outcome in term of hearing gain in ossiculoplasty with autologous incus and Teflon made TORP/PORP in cases of chronic otitis media (COM) with ossicular disruption. 60 patients of COM between age of 11-50 years who had ossicular disruption were included in the study. They were divided into two groups of 30 patients/ group: group 1 included those patients who had mucosal COM and group 2 included those who had squamous COM. They were further subdivided into 3 subgroups each as per the ossiculoplasty material used. Pre-operative pure tone audiometry (PTA) was done. They all were followed-up at 3 months after surgery and at that time PTA was done. Pre-and post-operative hearing was compared and hearing improvement was calculated in term of air-bone gap (ABG). Out of 60 cases, 16 cases marked as failure of ossicular reconstruction as post-operative A-B gap was > 30 dB. Among these 16 cases, 7 were those patients whom ossiculoplasty was done using autologous incus and in rest 9 patients PORP/TORP was used. Success rate of ossiculoplasty using refashioned incus was 76.66% whereas Teflon TORP/PORP had success rate of 70.00%. We conclude that hearing improvement after ossiculoplasty with autologous incus is better as compare with that obtained by Teflon TORP/PORP. Also, it is a cost-effective method.

AB  - Objective: To assess ossiculoplasty results in children and screen for predictive factors of efficacy.
   Patients and methods: Seventy five children undergoing ossiculoplasty between 2001 and 2014 in a pediatric ENT department were included. The following data were collected and analyzed: demographic data, surgical indication, history of tympanoplasty, contralateral ear status (healthy, affected), preoperative hearing thresholds, surgical technique, intraoperative findings, and ossicular chain status at eardrum opening. Audiological results were reported according to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines.
   Results: Forty eight patients were included in the total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (TORP) group. Mean age at surgery was 9.9 years. Mean follow up was 2.7 years. Mean air-bone gap (ABG) closure to within 20 dB was achieved in 40% of cases at medium term (12 to 18 months after surgery). Air conduction (AC) threshold <= 30 dB was achieved in 68% of cases. AC threshold improved by 14.6 dB and 8.7 dB at medium and long-term follow-up, respectively. A significant correlation was found between success rate and absence of history of tympanoplasty. The success rate was higher for primary than for revision procedures. Twenty seven children were included in the partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (PORP) group. Mean age was 9.5 years, and mean follow-up 2.6 years. Mean air-bone gap (ABG) closure to within 20 dB was achieved in 75% of cases at medium term. AC threshold <= 30 dB was achieved in 75% of cases AC threshold improved by 9.3 dB and 5 dB at medium and long-term follow-up, respectively. No predictive factors for success were found in the PORP group.
   Conclusion: The present study suggested that total ossiculoplasty leads to better results when performed in first-line. It also confirmed that functional outcome is better in partial than total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to analyze the factors affecting postoperative hearing results of patients with otosclerosis.
   Methods: Medical records of 245 patients with clinical otosclerosis who underwent stapes surgery at our center from January 2009 to December 2018 were reviewed. The retrospectively collected data included patients' demographics, clinical characteristics, pre- and postoperative audiometric data, size of preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) (small/large). The patients were categorized into two groups according to the postoperative functional outcome: Group 1 consisted of patients with a postoperative ABG of <= 10 dB and Group 2 comprised those with a postoperative ABG of >10 dB. Evaluation of factors affecting functional outcome were performed by logistic regression analysis. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was generated to obtain the cut-off points for preoperative ABG.
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of age group (p = 0.393), gender (p = 0.670), operated side (p = 0.370), and laterality of disease (p = 0.607). There were 42 patients (31.6%) with a small ABG and 91 patients (68.4%) with a large ABG in group 1, and six (13.6%) and 38 patients (86.4%), respectively in group 2. There was a statistical significant difference between the groups in terms of the size of preoperative ABG (p = 0.020). In group 1, the mean preoperative air conduction (AC) threshold and preoperative ABG were significantly lower than in group 2 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of the preoperative bone conduction (BC) threshold (p = 0.406). Preoperatively, the AC threshold and large ABG were found to be significantly poorer prognostic factors (p < 0.001; 95%CI: 1.031-1.210 and p = 0.037; 95%CI: 1.063-7.023, respectively). Preoperative ABG cut-off threshold for functional success was found to be 34.5 dB. The functional success rate was significantly higher in patients with a preoperative ABG of <34.5 than in patients with a preoperative ABG of >= 34.5 dB (p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The preoperative AC threshold and large ABG were poor prognostic factors for postoperative hearing outcome in patients with otosclerosis. The functional outcomes were similar in patients with a preoperative small ABG and those with a preoperative ABG of <34.5 dB. A preoperative ABG cut-off value of <34.5 dB should be possibly considered as a parameter for predicting surgical success in otosclerosis and seems to be useful in clinical practice.

AB  - Aim: To assess the CT scan aspect of cement bridges used to repair incudostapedial joint discontinuity (ISD) and correlate these observations to audiometric data over time.
   Material and methods: A retrospective study in 12 patients with cement rebridging for ISD compared preand post-operative pure-tone average thresholds, Hounsfield units (HU), and bridge size and position on postoperative CT scans.
   Results: Mean pre- and post-operative air-bone gap (ABG) was 24.5 and 16 dB, respectively. HU did not vary over time post-surgery, with no significant correlation between HU and time to postoperative CTnscan up to 24 months (p = 0.219). However, a "suggestive" correlation was found between postoperative ABG and HU (p = 0.004, r= -0.7). High cement density correlated with good functional outcome: HU < 500 indicating functional failure and >1000 indicating ABG closure.
   Conclusion: Immediate cement polymerization quality (high HU) was stable over time and a marker of ossiculoplasty success, correlating with good functional outcome. Particular care should be taken in preparing the cement, and solidification needs to be on dry mucosa-free ossicles. (C) 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To evaluate early results on hygiene, safety and functional outcome in a population undergoing a canal wall up technique with bony obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanic space (CWU-BOT) for extensive cholesteatoma, performed by a single surgeon. This study compares different techniques of tympanic membrane reconstruction, viz. allografts and autografts. Patients A consecutive series of 61 ears with acquired cholesteatoma treated with primary or revision CWU-BOT surgery from 2009 to 2014. Intervention Obliteration was performed by the use of cortical bone-chips and bone pate. Patients were followed up with micro-otoscopy and MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging. Ossicular reconstruction was performed using a remodelled autologous or allogenic incus or malleus. Main outcome measures Residual and recurrence rate and short- and mid-term hearing outcome prior to any revision tympanoplasty were analysed, the effect of type of tympanic membrane reconstruction was considered. Results 44 Ears were primary cholesteatoma cases, 17 cases were referred for revision surgery. Mean postoperative follow up was 45 months (SD 18.08) and mean follow-up until the last non-EP DW MRI 42 months (SD 17.72). Recurrent disease was present in 3%, no residual disease was present. An AC gain was seen in 75% of all ears undergoing ossicular reconstruction. Conclusion Reproducible safety, hygiene and hearing results with limited recurrence and residual disease can be obtained by younger otologic surgeons performing the BOT-CWU for extensive cholesteatoma while using a variety of grafts for tympano-ossicular reconstruction. The tympano-ossicular allograft nevertheless shows superior hearing results when a mobile intact stapes is present.

AB  - Background Chronic otitis media (COM) often necessitates tympanoplasty to repair the tympanic membrane. While conventional postaural tympanoplasty (PA) is well-established, endoscopic transcanal tympanoplasty (ET) is gaining traction for its minimally invasive benefits. This study aims to compare these two surgical techniques regarding their anatomical and functional outcomes and assess the role of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in improving these outcomes. Material and methods This prospective comparative study was conducted at Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, involving 60 patients with COM. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either ET or PA, with each group further subdivided based on PRP use. Preoperative evaluations included auditory function tests and diagnostic endoscopy. Postoperative assessments were performed at seven days, one month, and three months to evaluate graft acceptance and hearing improvement using pure tone audiometry (PTA). Statistical analyses included the chi-square test, t-test, ANOVA, and paired t-test. Results The study included patients with a mean age of 38.1 years, predominantly female (71.67%). ET demonstrated superior anatomical outcomes compared to PA, with higher graft acceptance rates and better hearing improvements. The average hearing gain was 10.4 dB in the ET group versus 8.1 dB in the PA group. PRP uses enhanced graft acceptance and hearing restoration across both surgical approaches, contributing to better overall outcomes. Conclusion ET offers significant advantages over conventional postaural tympanoplasty in terms of anatomical and functional results. PRP further improves surgical outcomes, making ET a preferable option for tympanoplasty in COM patients. These findings support the broader adoption of ET and PRP to enhance patient outcomes in tympanoplasty procedures.

AB  - Absence of the long process of the incus with or without absence of the stapes head accounts for more than 80% of ossicular discontinuities. Total or partial replacement prostheses, made of various materials, are interposed to restore the transfer function of the middle ear. To simplify ossicular reconstruction, reduce operative times and costs, improve functional outcomes, and avoid the risk of infections, we have adopted, during the past 10 years, a technique that makes use of a personally designed alloplastic prosthetic device. The prosthesis connects the malleus to the footplate, even in the presence of the stapes superstructure. This malleus-to-footplate prosthesis consists in a plastipore-coated steel piston and hydroxyapatite head, complete with a groove. The groove is placed beneath the malleus neck after dissection of the tensor tympani tendon and the shaft of the piston on the footplate. Two hundred ninety primary ossiculoplasties with the malleus-to-footplate prostheses were performed in 265 patients from 1986 to 1995 in the ENT Department of the University of Verona. The average postoperative air-bone gap at 0.5 to 3 kHz was 11 dB at 1 year and 14 dB at 5 years. These outcomes are significantly better than those personally obtained previously with ossicular or alloplastic prostheses. No extrusions occurred. The structural characteristics of the malleus-to-footplate prosthesis endow the prosthesis with a high degree of biocompatibility and stability and optimal sound-transfer function. The rationale for this particular ossiculoplasty procedure is discussed.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to assess the graft and functional outcomes of inlay butterfly cartilage-perichondrium graft myringoplasty in an office setting. Material and Methods: Adult patients with chronic perforations underwent inlay butterfly cartilage-perichondrium graft myringoplasty under local and topical anesthesia. The graft and functional outcomes, intraoperative pain score, and complications were evaluated at 6 months postoperatively. Results: A total of 39 patients (39 ears) were included in this study. All patients completed 6 months of follow-up. The mean operation time was 26.5 +/- 3.2 (ranged from 21 to 32) minutes. The intraoperative mean pain score was 0.61 +/- 0.28. The graft success rate was 97.4% (38/39) at 6 months postoperatively. The mean preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 19.18 +/- 4.01 dB, while the mean postoperative ABG at 6 months was 10.56 +/- 2.27 dB (P < .05; Paired-Samples T Test). The functional success rate was 100.0% (38/38). Endoscopic examination showed that the transplanted perichondrium graft gradually atrophied, flattened, and became indistinguishable from the surrounding tympanic membrane 2 to 3 months following surgery, the superficial layer of perichondrium graft formed the crust and migrated into the external auditory canal at 3 to 6 months postoperatively. Conclusions: Perichondrium-cartilage inlay butterfly myringoplasty is a highly successful and minimally invasive procedure well tolerated by adults for closure of small- and medium-sized perforations in an office setting.

AB  - ObjectiveTo test the hypothesis that conductive hearing loss (CHL) is associated with dementia, and that middle ear reconstruction (MER) associates with improved outcomes for these measures in a multinational electronic health records database.Study DesignRetrospective cohort study with propensity-score matching (PSM).SettingTriNetX is a research database representing about 110 million patients from the United States, Taiwan, Brazil, and India.PatientsSubjects older than 50 years with no HL and any CHL (ICD-10: H90.0-2). Subjects of any age with and without any MER (CPT: 1010174).Main Outcome MeasuresOdds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for incident dementia (ICD-10: F01, F03, G30).ResultsOf 103,609 patients older than 50 years experiencing any CHL, 2.74% developed dementia compared with 1.22% of 38,216,019 patients with no HL (OR, 95% CI: 2.29, 2.20-2.37). Of patients experiencing CHL, there were 39,850 who received MER. The average age was 31.3 years, with 51% female patients. A total of 343,876 control patients with CHL were identified; 39,900 patients remained in each cohort after 1:1 PSM for HL- and dementia-related risk factors. Matched risk for developing dementia among MER recipients was 0.33% compared with 0.58% in controls (OR: 0.58, 0.46-0.72).ConclusionsCHL increases the odds for dementia, and MER improves the odds for incident dementia. This study represents the first population study on the topic of CHL, MER, and dementia.

AB  - Objective: Physicians and patients alike have concerns regarding exposing in vivo implanted metal stapes prostheses to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. As MRI scanners become more powerful, the possibility for stapes prosthesis displacement due to ferromagnetic forces increases. It is hypothesized that some metal stapes prostheses may be exposed to powerful MRI scanners without leading to potential adversities for patients.
   Study Design: Literature review, retrospective case review, and physician survey.
   Settings: Tertiary care, University Medical Center.
   Materials and Methods: A review of the medical literature, a retrospective case review, and a clinical survey were performed.
   Results: In the history of stapes prostheses, I adverse patient outcome was causally substantiated when a defective stapes prosthesis was exposed to an MRI field. Otherwise, a review of the literature on experiments investigating stapes prostheses and MRI fields revealed a lack of any adverse clinical reports. In addition, 2 physician's surveys revealed no other cases of symptoms or damage to the ears of patients with stapes prostheses that had been exposed to an MRI scanner.
   Conclusion: All patients with a metallic stapes prosthesis may be sent to the MRI scanner, with the exception of I specific defective prosthesis type. The exception is a 1987 accidental mismanufacture of several lots of McGee pistons with a magnetic alloy. Patients with these specifically identified lots of McGee pistons should go to a computed tomographic scanner or be reimplanted with another prosthesis if MRI scans are mandatory. It would be advisable for manufacturers to use nonferromagnetic metals such as titanium for production of future stapes prostheses.

AB  - High intensity noise levels can lead to dislocation in the ossicular chain, particularly at the incus and the incudostapedial joint, significantly impacting hearing ability. However, the sensitivity of the middle ear system following ossicular chain restoration to intense external stimuli and the reconstructed material's nonlinear characteristics are still poorly understood. In order to investigate these aspects, a multi-degree-of-freedom mechanical model is developed on healthy and pathological ossicular chain reconstructions. Firstly, implant material parameters are determined by analyzing the natural frequencies of the system in an undamped condition. Secondly, the dynamic characteristics of the middle ear system are examined under various external excitations. Thirdly, utilizing a multi-time scale method, an approximate solution is derived for near-resonant frequency systems. Finally, the periodic solution stability is analyzed and assess how reconstructed middle ear parameters influence it. It is important to note that in healthy patients, post-ossicular chain reduction should be maintained in-ear sound pressure below 95 dB SPL, while for patients with pathology reconstruction, it should be kept below 65 dB SPL.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the objective and subjective long-term binaural benefits of surgical correction in children with unilateral congenital aural atresia, using an open-set sentence test in noise and subjective questionnaires.
   Design: A prospective study was performed between August 2010 and February 2013. This study included pediatric patients who had unilateral conductive hearing loss (normal bone conduction hearing) on the atretic side but normal air conduction hearing on the normal side and were scheduled to undergo a primary canaloplasty. Pure-tone audiometry, the hearing in noise test (HINT), and questionnaires (Sound-Spatial-Qualities of Hearing Scale; Glasgow Benefit Inventory [GBI]) were administered preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.
   Results: Among 34 consecutive patients who initially met enrollment criteria, 26 subjects (23 boys and 3 girls) aged 10 to 16 years (mean 12.3 years) completed this study. Canaloplasty and hearing restoration procedures were performed uneventfully in all patients. The mean air conduction thresholds were significantly improved from 63.9 to 35.0 dB (6 months) and 39.4 dB (12 months) after surgery (p < 0.001). In HINT, speech understanding in noise that was presented toward the newly opened atretic ear significantly improved at 1 year postoperatively (p = 0.014). In noise toward the normal ear, speech understanding significantly improved after surgery, from -0.1 dB preoperatively to -2.0 dB at 6 months (p = 0.002) and -1.8 dB at 12 months (p = 0.005) (p for quadratic trend = 0.036). The composite score improved from -2.6 dB preoperatively to -3.4 dB at 6 months and -3.6 dB at 12 months (p = 0.045; p for linear trend = 0.005). The Sound-Spatial-Qualities of Hearing Scale scores in all domains significantly improved 1 year after surgery (p < 0.034). The mean GBI scores in each domain ranged from 14.2 to 49.4. Total GBI score was correlated with better signal to noise ratio in noise toward the atretic ear as measured by HINT at postoperative 1 year (Spearman = 0.482, p = 0.013).
   Conclusions: Teenaged patients with unilateral congenital aural atresia showed satisfactory hearing improvement after canaloplasty with hearing restoration surgery. In a serial long-term follow-up, speech understanding in noise measured by HINT improved over time. One year after surgery, teenaged children acquired binaural hearing (binaural squelch), as measured by the HINT with noise presented to the newly opened atretic ear. Subjective questionnaires also showed improvements in binaural hearing function and quality of life.

AB  - Objective. Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) is considered a minimally invasive technique. It is hypothesized that patients after endoscopic procedures experience less pain and require fewer painkillers. Our aim was to compare patients' postoperative pain and need for analgesics in patients undergoing microscopic and endoscopic ear surgeries. Methods. a single-institution, prospective study included 92 patients undergoing ear procedures (48 cholesteatoma and 44 reconstructive);(43 endoscopic and 49 microscopic) during 1/2016-1/2018. The postoperative pain (visual analogue scale (VAS) 0-10) and painkillers consumption were recorded and compared in each subgroup. Results. VAS (P=0.02) and analgesics consumption (P=0.06) were lower after endoscopic ear surgeries. In the cholesteatoma group, 94% of endoscopic patients reported VAS 0-2 in contrast to 58 % of microscopic patients on day 1 (P=0.04). Similar tendencies were revealed in reconstructive cases, i.e. 92% compared to 73% (P>0.05). On day 1, 92% of endoscopic, and 77% of microscopic reconstruction patients received no painkillers group (P=0.06). In the cholesteatoma patients, 88% of endoscopic patients, 43% of microscopic patients using endaural approach, and 75% of microscopic patients using retroauricular approach, required no painkillers on the postoperative day 1 (P>0.05). Conclusions. Our study revealed that the EES is associated with less postoperative pain than the conventional microscopic ear surgery. It seems that it is rather the transmeatal approach, and not the endoscope itself that reduces postoperative pain. The removal of the same size cholesteatoma using endoscope (rather than using microscope) leads to less intensive postoperative pain. Consequently, it was not surprising that patients after endoscopic ear surgery very rarely took painkillers.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the functional outcomes of labyrinthine fistula treatment when the cholesteatoma matrix is totally removed and the defect is sealed with temporalis fascia during the same procedure.
   Materials and methods: Records of 188 patients who underwent middle car surgery for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma between June 2008-June 2014 in a tertiary referral center were retrospectively reviewed. Incidence of labyrinthine fistula, preoperative findings, types of surgery, intraoperative findings and postoperative functional outcomes were analyzed.
   Results: Incidence of labyrinth fistula was 17% (n=32). Lateral semicircular canal (LSSC) was the most frequent site for the fistula (90.6%). Thirty-two patients (10 females, 22 males) suffered this complication. Twenty-one patients underwent Canal Wall Down (CWD) Mastoidectomy without tympanoplasty and 11 patients underwent CWD Mastoidectomy + myringo-stapediopexy. Cholesteatoma matrix was removed and the defect was sealed with temporalis fascia (without using any other sealing material) in all cases. Bone conduction (BC) hearing level improved or remained unchanged in 24 patients; whereas eight patients out of 32 (25%) had a decrease in BC levels. In five (15.6%) of these patients, the impairment was more than 10 dB. None of the patients suffered total hearing loss preoperatively or postoperatively
   Conclusions: Removing the cholesteatoma matrix from the fistula site and covering the defect with temporalis fascia is a safe procedure in cases with labyrinthine fistulas. Temporalis fascia is a safe, economical and 'easy to harvest' sealing material that can be used alone especially for Type I and II fistulas.

AB  - Otosclerosis surgery is performed through a transcanal approach and requires long, thin instruments with submillimetric precision and precise amplitude of motion. The functional outcomes and complications of otosclerosis surgery depend on the experience of the surgeon. Thus, any technologic assistance that can enhance the surgeon's dexterity and rapidly reduce the learning curve could yield an even safer surgical procedure. One of the options is to use robotic assistance to achieve this goal. An overview of different robots designed for otosclerosis surgery is presented, focusing on the RobOtol system that we have designed as a multitask platform for ear surgery.

AB  - Background: The conventional therapy for severe mixed hearing loss is middle ear surgery combined with a power hearing aid. However, a substantial group of patients with severe mixed hearing loss cannot be treated adequately with today's state-of-the-art (SOTA) power hearing aids, as predicted by the accompanying part I of this publication, where we compared the available maximum power output (MPO) and gain from technical specifications to requirements for optimum benefit using a common fitting rule. Here, we intended to validate the theoretical assumptions from part I experimentally in a mixed hearing loss cohort fitted with SOTA power hearing aids. Additionally, we compared the results with an implantable hearing device that circumvents the impaired middle ear, directly stimulating the cochlea, as this might be a better option. Objectives: Speech recognition outcomes obtained from patients with severe mixed hearing loss supplied acutely with a SOTA hearing aid were studied to validate the outcome predictions as described in part I. Further, the results obtained with hearing aids were compared to those in direct acoustic cochlear implant (DACI) users. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients (37 ears with mixed hearing loss) were provided and fitted with a SOTA power hearing aid. Before and after an acclimatization period of at least 4 weeks, word recognition scores (WRS) in quiet and in noise were studied, as well as the speech reception threshold in noise (SRT). The outcomes were compared retrospectively to a second group of 45 patients (47 ears) using the DACI device. Based on the severity of the mixed hearing loss and the available gain and MPO of the SOTA hearing aid, the hearing aid and DACI users were subdivided into groups with prediction of sufficient, partially insufficient, or very insufficient hearing aid performance. Results: The patients with predicted adequate SOTA hearing aid performance indeed showed the best WRS in quiet and in noise when compared to patients with predicted inferior outcomes. Insufficient hearing aid performance at one or more frequencies led to a gradual decrease in hearing aid benefit, validating the criteria used here and in the accompanying paper. All DACI patients showed outcomes at the same level as the adequate hearing aid performance group, being significantly better than those of the groups with inadequate hearing aid performance. Whereas WRS in quiet and noise were sensitive to insufficient gain or output, showing significant differences between the SOTA hearing aid and DACI groups, the SRT in noise was less sensitive. Conclusions: Limitations of outcomes in mixed hearing loss individuals due to insufficient hearing aid performance can be accurately predicted by applying a commonly used fitting rule and the 35-dB dynamic range rule on the hearing aid specifications. Evidently, when outcomes in patients with mixed hearing loss using the most powerful hearing aids are insufficient, bypassing the middle ear with a powerful active middle ear implant or direct acoustic implant can be a promising alternative treatment.

AB  - Objective: To compare the functional outcomes and complications of stapedotomy with and without vein graft interposition
   Design: Retrospective case study
   Setting: Tertiary referral hospital
   Subjects: Sixty otosclerosis patients (66 ears) that underwent primary stapedotomy surgery and followed up for at least 6 months
   Interventions: Stapedotomy with vein graft interposition (n = 36) versus stapedotomy without interposition (n = 30)
   Main outcome measures: Mean postoperative 4-frequency (500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, 4000Hz) air-bone gap, postoperative hearing gains for individual frequencies, sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo
   Results: The mean postoperative 4-frequency (500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz, 4000Hz) air-bone gap with interposition was significantly higher than without interposition (16.4 +/- 9.4 dB versus 10.7 +/- 7.4 dB, respectively). Analyses of postoperative hearing gains revealed higher gains without interposition in all frequencies, significant for frequencies at 500Hz and 1000Hz in AC, and 4000 Hz in BC thresholds. Although the frequency of sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo did not differ between groups, sensorineural hearing loss tended to be higher with vein graft interposition.
   Conclusion: Stapedotomy without interposition required less manipulation, thereby leading to satisfactory results without major complications. Difficulties in performing the vein graft interposition technique requiring more manipulations and skill may be a disadvantage. Prospective randomized studies with larger series comparing different techniques can better evaluate the results.

AB  - Over the last 20 years, the number of stapes operations performed has decreased steadily. This inadequate exposure to stapes surgery poses problems for both trainees and trainers. We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of stapedotomy performed by a young physician at the ENT Clinic of the "A. Gemelli" Hospital of Rome. We used the technique of "one-shot" CO2 Laser stapedotomy using a titanium-Teflon piston. For data analysis, we considered the audiograms obtained 24 hours preoperatively and at the last follow-up examination (mean 45 months). Air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) PTA were calculated for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz thresholds. Air bone gap (ABG) were obtained from ACPTA and BCPTA. Postoperative hearing gain was calculated from the ABG before the operation minus the ABG at late follow-up examination. Analysis of outcomes did not show a clear endpoint for the learning curve; complete closure of the ABG was obtained in a large number of patients at the beginning followed by patients who showed a higher ABG. Fortunately, we did not observed any "dead ear". The study supports a learning curve in stapes surgery, but the results can vary widely among surgeries with excellent results followed by others that are not fully satisfactory. Stapes surgery should not be one of the first ear surgeries performed by a young otologist due to the functional outcome expected by patients and the lack of necessary surgical skills.

AB  - Purpose: Chronic otitis media surgery is the most common procedure in otology in developing countries. Subtotal and total tympanic membrane (TM) perforation with inadequate anterior remnant is associated with higher rate of graft failure. It was the goal of this study to test the anatomical and functional outcomes of a modified underlay myringoplasty technique.
   Materials and methods: In a prospective clinical study, 45 patients with subtotal or total TM perforation and inadequate anterior remnant underwent tympanoplasty (+/- mastoidectomy). The anterior tip of the temporalis fascia was secured in a mucosal pocket on the lateral wall of eustachian tube orifice. Data on graft take rate, preoperative and postoperative hearing status, and intraoperative findings were analyzed.
   Results: We achieved the graft success rate of 91.1%, without lateralization, blunting, atelectasia, or epithelial pearls. Approximately 24% patients had air-bone gap within 25 dB before intervention, which increased to 71% postoperatively (P < .001).
   Conclusion: We believe that this technique could be a convenient and suitable method for cases with subtotal or total TM perforation and inadequate anterior remnant. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To compare functional outcome of microscopic and endoscopic approach regarding type of ossiculoplasty.Methods: In this retrospective study, cases who had undergone type-II and type-III tym-panoplasty between February 2007 to September 2019 were divided into two groups according to the type of approach as microscopic and endoscopic. In cases with type-II reconstruction; Partial Ossicular chain Replacement Prosthesis (PORP), incus interposition and bone cement were used in order of frequency. Whereas in cases with type-III reconstruction, only Total Ossicular chain Replacement Prosthesis (TORP) was used. The average Air Bone Gap (ABG) was deter-mined pre-and post-operatively for the calculation of Air Conductance Gain (ACG). The ACG, pre-and post-operative ABG values of each group were compared with regard to the type of ossiculoplasty.Results: A total of 79 cases consisting of 32 females and 47 males who had undergone type-II and type-III tympanoplasty were enrolled. No statistically significant difference between microscopic and endoscopic approach was found in terms of ACG (p = 0.42), pre-(p = 0.23) and postoperative ABG (p = 0.99). We did not find any significant difference in terms of ACG, pre-and postoperative ABG between two approaches for type-II and type-III reconstructions (p > 0.05).Conclusions: According to the current study, endoscopic approach in type-II and type-III reconstruction is at least reliable as microscopic approach regarding functional outcome. Since both techniques have similar functional results, other factors (anatomic characteristics, habitude of the surgeon and duration of the surgery) should be considered when choosing the technique. Level of evidence: In the current paper we present a retrospective comparative study of two different approaches of a particular type of otologic surgery. Level of evidence corresponds to level III.

AB  - Conclusion: The cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging technique has proved to be reliable for assessing the appropriate positioning of the floating mass transducer (FMT) in the round window (RW) niche, although some parameters do not seem to be essential for achieving a satisfactory functional outcome. Objectives: To evaluate the role that specific imaging parameters derived from CBCT of the temporal bone have for predicting the functional outcome after RW vibroplasty (RW-VP). Methods: CBCT imaging was carried out in a homogeneous group of patients who presented with a mixed type of hearing loss after open tympanoplasty. Three arbitrary radiological parameters were taken into account: the FMT/RW membrane contact, bony contacts of the FMT margins, and the inferior FMT tissue support. The audiological assessment took into consideration the PTA4 (500-4000 Hz), the PTA2 (125-250 Hz), and the word recognition score (WRS) in quiet and in noise. Results: One subject presented with all positive CBCT parameters and showed a good, but not the best auditory performance among the study group. In the majority of the subjects, with a satisfactory postoperative hearing improvement, at least two of the three radiological parameters were present. In comparison with the unaided condition, an improvement in both the PTA4 and PTA2 was found in all the subjects.

AB  - Objectives To identify the predictors of anatomical and functional outcomes following tympanoplasty. Study Design A retrospective cohort study. Methods Patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) who underwent a tympanoplasty at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019 were retrospectively included. Outcome measures included graft success and postoperative pure tone audiometry air-bone gap (PTA-ABG) at last follow-up (>= 6 months). PTA-ABG and MERI were calculated. Descriptive, univariable, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the predictors of the graft and hearing outcomes. Results During the study, 385 patients (167 male, 218 female, median age 44 years) undergoing 413 procedures were studied. Out of this, 219 ears underwent tympanoplasty, 45 ears had tympanoplasty with canal wall up mastoidectomy, and 149 ears had tympanoplasty with canal wall down mastoidectomy. At the last follow-up, the overall graft success rate was 91.3% (377/413) and the overall hearing success rate was 40% (165/413). Multivariable analysis results showed that the obstructed aditus ad antrum (OR 2.67, 95%CI 1.13-6.30; P = .025) was an independent prognostic factor for graft failures. Moreover, the obstructed aditus ad antrum (OR 2.18, 95%CI 1.16-4.08; P = .015) and MERI >3 (OR 6.53, 95%CI 3.55-12.02; P < .001) were independent predictors of hearing failures (PTA-ABG > 20 dB). Conclusions Aditus ad antrum patency was an independent predictor of both graft and hearing success among patients following tympanoplasty. MERI score greater than three was found to be a significant predictor of postoperative hearing and could serve as a useful tool for assisting clinicians in perioperative risk assessment. Level of Evidence 4.

AB  - Background
   Chronic otitis media with anterior perforation is a challenging condition to treat with a microscope especially if the canal is narrow or has overhang. The endoscope provides the advantage of wide-angle view and transcanal access avoiding postauricular approach and canaloplasty.
   Objective
   To compare the anatomical, functional outcomes, and surgical duration between endoscopic and microscopic type-I tympanoplasty performed for anterior perforation.
   Materials and methods
   A comparative study was conducted. The two groups, the microscopic (MT) and the endoscopic (ET) were created with 50 cases each and underwent type-I tympanoplasty. Results were evaluated at a minimum follow-up of 12 months.
   Results
   The graft uptake rate in MT and ET was 81.8% and 91.3% respectively and was not statistically significant. The mean operative time for MT and ET was 68.68 +/- 18.79 min and 61.24 +/- 11.18 min respectively which was significant (p-.003). Endoscopic tympanoplasty significantly saved time. The difference in hearing outcomes was highly significant within the groups but not between the groups.
   Conclusion and significance
   The endoscopic tympanoplasty offered superior visualization avoiding postauricular incision and canaloplasty, with morphological and functional outcomes comparable to microscopic tympanoplasty. It offers significantly faster completion of procedure and provides minimally invasive surgery.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to analyze the morphological and functional outcomes in a series of 60 patients for whom Type I tympanoplasty was done using alcohol preserved nasal septal cartilage allograft through endoscopic permeatal route. The study was a prospective, interventional (surgical) study of 60 patients between October 2012 and September 2014. Patients were operated using 0 degrees, 4 mm, 18 cm long Hopkin's rod endoscope through permeatal route. 70% ethyl alcohol preserved allogeneic nasal septal cartilage with thickness of around 0.5 mm was used for grafting. At the end of 6 months, final assessment of morphological outcome i.e. intact tympanic membrane and functional outcome i.e. reduction in Air Bone gap, was done. At the end of 6 months, 57 patients (95%) had intact tympanic membrane. Mean ABG in postoperative patients was 11.83 dB. The operative time taken in 42 patients (70%) was 30-45 min. 42 patients (70%) returned to normal activity in 3-5 days. Endoscopic cartilage tympanoplasty using allogenic nasal septal cartilage can be safely and effectively used for Type I tympanoplasty with good anatomical and audiological results with benefits of reduced operating time, morbidity, pain and 'No scar'.

Audiometric results comparing the cartilage and fascia groups at six months also continued to patients follow up to one year after surgery. An intact graft and an air-bone gap (ABG) <= 20 dB were regarded as surgical success. Results with a p-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The graft success rate was 91.3 per cent of the cartilage group compared with 68.9 per cent of the temporalis fascia group, respectively. In the fascia group, preoperative ABG was 22.28 +/- 8.76 dB and postoperative ABG was 17.60 +/- 10.96 dB. In cartilage group, preoperative ABG was 22.43 +/- 8.07 dB and postoperative ABG was 14.93 +/- 8.69 dB. The anatomical success rate of cartilage group was better than fascia group statistically (P<0.01). There was no statistically significiant differences among functional outcomes between fascia and cartilage groups (P>0.05). Conclusion: Our data suggest that the anatomical success rate of cartilage tympanoplasty was higher compared with fascia tympanoplasty. Functional results with cartilage wasn't different than fascia despite we didn't thinning tragal cartilage.

AB  - Objectives: As prostheses and techniques related to stapes surgery develop and improve, there is a need to assess the functional outcomes of the surgery objectively. This study provides a bench test method to assess the functional results of stapes surgery by measuring volume displacement at the round window (RW), which is closely related to pressure propagation of the travelling wave inside the cochlea and thus to hearing.
   Design: Motion of the RW membrane in fresh temporal bones was measured using a scanning laser Doppler interferometry system for normal and reconstructed conditions, and the performance of the reconstruction with stapes surgery was quantitatively assessed by comparison of the volume displacements at the RW between the two conditions. To obtain optimal measurements, reflectivity of the laser beam of the scanning laser Doppler interferometry system was improved by retroreflective beads coated onto the surface of the RW, and orientation of the RW membrane relative to the laser beam was obtained using micro-computed tomography imaging.
   Results: From measurements in 12 temporal bones, difference in the RW volume displacement between normal ears and ears reconstructed with stapes surgery was approximately 15 dB below 2 kHz and approximately 10 dB above 4 kHz, which was comparable with air-bone gaps in patients after stapes surgery. Two different sizes of the stapes prostheses were also tested (n = 3), and a tendency toward a better outcome with a larger diameter was found.
   Conclusion: The method developed in this study can be used to assess various prostheses and surgical conditions objectively in controlled laboratory environments. It may also have potential for providing ways to assess other middle-and inner-ear surgeries, and to study other aspects of hearing science.

AB  - Purpose Retrospective evaluation of bilateral same-day myringoplasty outcomes. Methods Patients who underwent bilateral same-day myringoplasty from 2005 to 2019. Results Thirty-eight patients underwent bilateral myringoplasty. Mean age was 44.5 years and 55.3% patients were male. Tragal perichondrium-cartilage composite graft was the most frequently used graft material (82.9%). Perforation closure was achieved in 78.9%. Postoperative Pure Tone Average and Air-Bone Gap decreased significantly (p < 0.05), except for the Air-Bone Gap of the right ear (p = 0.058). The complications were cholesteatoma (1.3%), otorrhea (6.6%) and tympanic membrane retraction (1.3%). Conclusions Bilateral same-day myringoplasty is a feasible procedure in selected patients. Good anatomic and functional outcomes, as well as a low rate of complications, are achieved with this procedure, improving patient comfort and allowing for a reduction in operation time and costs.

AB  - Objective: This study sought to evaluate the demographics as well as clinical, audiometric, and surgical outcomes of patients who underwent endoscopic and microscopic stapedotomies.
   Methods: This study enrolled 87 otosclerosis patients who underwent endoscopic and microscopic stapedotomies.
   Results: In total, 44 and 43 surgeries were performed using an endoscope and a microscope, respectively. No significant difference was noted in the air-bone gaps of the cohort before or after the procedures (P =.611). Both procedures resulted in similar audiometric outcomes. The mean operative time was more significant in the last 22 patients of the endoscopic group than in the first 22 patients and patients who underwent microscopic stapedotomy (P =.027 and P =.018, respectively).
   Conclusions: Endoscopic stapedotomy exhibits a learning curve similar to that of other procedures. Patient outcomes were similar between the endoscopic and microscopic procedures.

AB  - Objectives:To assess long-term outcomes after secondary mastoid obliteration.Study Design:Case series with chart review.Setting:Tertiary care center.Patients:Adult patients (20-80 yr of age) undergoing secondary mastoid obliteration.Outcome Measures:Hearing results (improvement in pure-tone average air-bone gap [PTA-ABG] from baseline) at the time of postoperative audiometry and at least 5 years after surgery, anatomic outcomes (rate of successful tympanic membrane graft healing), and the incidences of observed complications.Results:An average improvement in PTA-ABG by 16.9dB (p=1.8x10(-9)) was noted. Postoperatively, the PTA-ABG was successfully closed to 20dB in 39.5% (17/43) of patients. The average final PTA-ABG (obtained at least 5 years after surgery) was 25.3dB, which was also a significant improvement over the preoperative baseline PTA-ABG (p <<< 0.01). Significant complications were observed in 14.0% (6/43) of patients, with 9.3% (4/43) requiring a subsequent surgery. Although 69.8% (30/43) of patients experienced otorrhea preoperatively, otorrhea was only observed in 4.7% (2/43) at any point in time postoperatively.Conclusion:Secondary mastoid obliteration with reconstruction of a more natural posterior canal wall, cartilage tympanoplasty, and ossicular chain reconstruction is a hybrid technique that allows for creation of a safe, dry ear with significant, long-term improvement in hearing and functional outcomes in patients with unstable mastoid cavities.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. To assess the use of titanium prostheses in tympanoplasty for reconstruction of the sound pressure and to evaluate the audiometric results obtained.
   STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING AND PATIENTS: Retrospective chart review in a tertiary referral center. Between September 1998 and October 2000, 23 titanium middle ear implants (23 TORP) were used for reconstruction of the ossicular chain after tympanomastoidectomy. Preliminary functional results were obtained in 23 cases.
   RESULTS: Average follow-up time was 18 months (range, 12-40) and no adverse reactions or extrusions occurred. Seven of 16 canal wall down tympanoplasties (43.7%), and 3 of 7 canal wall up tympanoplasties performed (42.9%) had a postoperative air-bone gap of between 0 and 10 dB.
   CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary results show that titanium prosthesis provide a promising hearing result after total ossicular reconstruction, although long-term results are not yet available. The low weight of these prostheses may be the reason for the decrease in the air-bone gap.

AB  - Purpose: Although bilateral same-day tympanoplasty is a faster and more comfortable procedure for patients, it is rarely performed due to its theoretical risks. The present study aims to evaluate the results of patients who underwent bilateral same-day endoscopic tympanoplasty.
   Materials and methods: In this study, 26 patients and 52 ears were evaluated. Postoperative anatomic success rate, pre- and postoperative hearing test results, hearing gains and postoperative complications were recorded.
   Results: Postoperative anatomic success rate was 92,3% (48/52). Audiological tests revealed the preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) as 19.1 +/- 8.8 (7-35) dB and postoperative ABG as 9.8 +/- 5.7 (5-25) dB. Postoperative ABG decreased significantly (p: < 0.001) and 9.2 +/- 4.6 (2 -23) dB hearing gain was obtained. We did not observe any significant complications.
   Conclusion: Bilateral same-day endoscopic tympanoplasty is a feasible surgical procedure with good anatomic and functional outcomes, low complication rate and good postoperative patient comfort.

AB  - Endoscopes are presently used as an adjunct to microscopic surgery for better visualization of hidden areas of middle ear or they are used as a primary modality replacing the microscopes. We performed primary endoscopic ear surgery at a tertiary care center to evaluate the scope of endoscopic ear surgeries and to evaluate the anatomical, functional and quality of life outcomes. We evaluated 103 cases of which included patients with chronic otitis media mucosal disease (64), chronic otitis media squamous disease (29), otosclerosis (6), and benign ear tumors (4). In our study, the structural and functional outcomes of endoscopic ear surgeries were comparable to microscopic techniques however it conferred superior patient related outcomes of cosmesis, post-operative pain and early return to daily routine. Thus endoscopic ear surgery is a minimally invasive alternative option to microscopic techniques in the field of otology.

AB  - Objective: Auditory testing is not routinely performed within 4 to 6 weeks after stapedotomy because hearing acuity is thought to be transiently depressed. The early postoperative effects of the 1-shot carbon dioxide (CO2) laser have never been reported. The purpose of this study is to present data for auditory thresholds measured within 2 days of laser stapedotomy and at the last follow-up.
   Study Design: The study was prospective and unblinded.
   Setting: The study was conducted at the "A. Gemelli" University Hospital.
   Methods: From January to December 2008, 58 subjects underwent "1-shot" CO2 laser stapedotomies for otosclerosis. Puretonal audiometric test was performed preoperatively 2 days after surgery and at least 1 month after surgery during the follow-up.
   Results: The closure of air-bone gap began in the early postoperative period and continued to improve through the late postoperative period. Bone-conduction hearing thresholds were stable even in the early postoperative follow-up and remained stable trough all the course of the study.
   Conclusion: Our data, supported by the literature, suggest that 1-shot CO2 laser stapedotomy is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of otosclerosis.

AB  - Craniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD) is a genetic bone disorder involving an abnormality of modeling of the long bones and sclerosis of the cranium. Both conductive and sensorineural hearing may be frequently associated with this syndrome. Conductive hearing loss is due to attic fixation of the lateral ossicular chain and hyperostosis formation with stapes ankylosis. Two patients with CMD were treated surgically. Two of three ears operated on had closure of the air-bone gap, whereas the third ear failed ossicular reconstruction because of hyperosis of the promontory with deepening of the oval window.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Two-stage ossiculoplasty has been widely used for hearing improvement in chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma. However, the outcomes of single-stage ossiculoplasty have not been fully clarified.The aim of this study is to determine whether the outcomes of single-stage ossiculoplasty are comparable with those of 2-stage ossiculoplasty in chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma.
   METHODS: Medical records of 191 cases (187 patients) who underwent single-stage ossiculoplasty from January 2011 to May 2018 at our hospital were retrospectively reviewed.
   RESULTS: Polycel and titanium were used in 56 and 135 cases, respectively. In chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma, the success rate of polycel and titanium partial ossicular replacement prosthesis was 80.7% and 81,6%, respectively. In chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, the success rate of polycel and titanium partial ossicular replacement prosthesis was 63.6% and 64.6%, respectively, while that of polycel and titanium total ossicular replacement prosthesis was 45.9% and 47.8%, respectively.
   CONCLUSION: These results suggest that single-stage ossiculoplasty is a suitable option for recovering postoperative hearing in chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma. Thus, if middle ear inflammation can be sufficiently treated in the first stage, single-stage ossiculoplasty is a suitable option for chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the functional results of glass ionomer cement (GIC) and incus transposition (IT) used for treatment of incus long process defects in pediatric patients. The medical records of 40 patients, aged 10 to 16 years, who underwent ossicular reconstruction due to incus long process defect between January 2010 and July 2017 were reviewed for age and gender, types of ossiculoplasty technique, types of graft used for tympanic membrane repair, preoperative-postoperative audiological examinations, and length of follow-up. The mean preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 29.40 (8.47) dB, the mean postoperative ABG was 15.25 (8.55) dB in the entire group, and the difference was statistically significant (P< .001). The functional outcome (ABG <= 20 dB) was 80% (32 patients) in the entire group. The mean hearing gain was 18.83 (9.43) dB and postoperative mean ABG was 20 dB or better in 17 (94.4%) patients in the GIC group. The mean hearing gain was 10.31 (9.44) dB, and postoperative mean ABG was 20 dB or better in 14 (63.6%) patients in the IT group. The mean hearing gain was significantly higher in the GIC group than in the IT group (P= .026), and the postoperative mean ABG was significantly higher in the IT group than in the GIC group (P= .045). The functional success rates were significantly higher in GIC group than in IT group (P= .020). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of postoperative speech reception threshold and word recognition scores (P= .628,P= .260, respectively). The graft success rates were 94.4% (17 patients) in the GIC group and 90.9% (20 patients) in the IT groups. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in operated side (P= 1.000). Reconstruction of small incus long process defects using GIC is a valuable technique and can be safely used in pediatric patients. The hearing outcomes are significantly better in GIC rebridging technique when compared with a sculpted IT technique.

AB  - Conclusions This technique is offered as a convenient and reliable method for cases with anterior TM perforation and inadequate anterior remnant. Objectives Chronic otitis media surgery is one of the most common procedures in otology. Anterior tympanic membrane (TM) perforation with inadequate anterior remnant is associated with higher rates of graft failure. It was the goal of this series to evaluate the anatomical and functional outcomes of a modified underlay myringoplasty technique-the anterior pull-through method. Materials and methods In a retrospective clinical study, 13 patients with anterior TM perforations with inadequate anterior remnants underwent tympanoplasty with anterior pull-through technique. The anterior tip of the temporalis fascia was pulled through and secured in a short incision lateral to the anterior part of the annulus. Data on graft take rate, pre-operative, and post-operative hearing status were analyzed. Results A graft success rate of 84.6% (11 out of 13) was achieved, without lateralization, blunting, atelectasia, or epithelial pearls. The air-bone gap was 21.5 +/- 6.8 dB before intervention and 11.75 +/- 5.7 dB after surgery (p = 0.003).

AB  - Recently, a new form of porous high density polyethylene (PolycelTM) has been promoted for use in ossicular chain reconstruction. However, we have found no reports of investigation of the fate of this material used for this purpose in either animals or man. This study was undertaken to look at the tissue tolerance and fate of Polycel in the middle ear of gerbils before its extensive use in humans. We present the light and transmission of electron microscopic findings from those prostheses,  removed from the middle ear between 1 and 5 months post-implantation. The results are similar to those found with Plastipore, showing a strong foreign body reaction and the likelihood of phagocytic consumption. As with the other porous plastics, we have reservations about the use of Polycel for ossicular reconstruction.

AB  - Objective. This paper highlights the importance of reporting air-bone gap closure in stapes surgery according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery guidelines and reviews compliance in recent years.
   Methods. A retrospective case series was conducted and the outcomes were reviewed. Closure of the air-bone gap was calculated in 204 adult patients using the aforementioned guidelines. Results were recalculated ignoring the Carhart phenomenon to determine any significant difference. Adherence to guidelines was also reported as a secondary outcome.
   Results. Ignoring the Carhart phenomenon resulted in 75 per cent over-reporting of successful air-bone gap closure (p < 0.001). Over-reporting occurred in 5.9 per cent of papers, and in 11.8 per cent it was difficult to determine how the results were reached.
   Conclusion. Despite the existence of clear guidelines, stapes surgery outcomes are still being over-reported as successful. This can lead to incorrect information being provided to patients during the consent process and makes comparative studies difficult.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility, morphological, and functional outcomes of endoscopic retrograde transcanal mastoidectomy. Study Design: Prospective study. Settings: Tertiary Referral Hospital. Materials and Methods: We analyzed 31 patients with a diagnosis of chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma that extended to the mastoid cavity who underwent endoscopic transcanal retrograde canal wall down mastoidectomy under general anesthesia. The tympanic membrane and posterior canal wall reconstruction were done using the tragal cartilage palisade technique reinforced with perichondrium. Morphological and functional results were reported in the follow-up of a minimum of 1 year. The graft uptake was also compared with the presence of granulations and discharge status. Results: Graft uptake and disease-free conditions were achieved in 21 of 24 patients, that is, 87.5%, and 3 patients required revision surgery. The graft uptake rate was not affected by the presence of granulation tissues and discharge. The hearing was improved after the surgery, which was statistically significant. Conclusion: Endoscopic retrograde mastoidectomy is a new technique to deal with cholesteatoma with excellent results. It is more functional, ideal for sclerotic mastoid, allows faster wound healing, has excellent outcomes, and is a minimally invasive procedure that avoids postauricular incision and tissue dissection. Because the set up for the surgery costs less, it holds a promising future for the developing countries.

AB  - ObjectiveThe efficacy of the transcanal endoscopic approach in tympanoplasty, cholesteatoma removal, and stapedotomy is detailed. This study reviews evidence on the feasibility of endoscopic ossiculoplasty as a suitable alternative to traditional microscopic ossiculoplasty.Data SourcesPubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 19 June 2024 for articles comparing endoscopic and microscopic ossicular chain reconstruction.Review MethodsThis systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The primary outcomes assessed include air bone gap closure, pre-operative and post-operative air bone gap, pure tone audiometry, and word recognition scores. The secondary outcomes include operation time, surgical success, and surgical complications. These outcomes between microscopic and endoscopic techniques were pooled and compared as mean differences using a random-effects model. The Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) and Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB2) scale were adopted to assess for study bias in observational studies and randomized controlled trials, respectively.ResultsThis study included five studies comprising 504 patients. While endoscopic ossiculoplasty had shorter operating durations (95% CI -42.97 to -1.57), it conferred comparable air bone gap closure (95% CI -0.34 to 3.76), post-operative pure tone audiogram (95% CI 10.97-18.77), and surgical success. Additional qualitative strengths identified in endoscopic ear surgery include improvements in visualization, decreased need for supplemental incisions, excellent ergonomics, and reduced post-operative pain.ConclusionOverall, endoscopic ossiculoplasty may confer comparable audiological outcomes to microscopic ossiculoplasty and may serve as a reasonable alternative surgical approach.

AB  - Though the standard canal wall up and canal wall down mastoidectomies provide for reliable disease removal and good functional outcome in most cases with atticoantral chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), few cases remain unresponsive to such treatment. This report describes the application of tympanomastoid obliteration with blind sac closure of the EAC as a surgical technique for recurrent CSOM persisting despite multiple previous surgical treatments. Though maximal conductive deafness is an inevitable consequence of this procedure, such morbidity may even otherwise be inevitable in this clinical situation, as scarring and destruction consequent to disease and previous surgical treatments often lead to clinical situations not amenable to tympanoplasty and hearing reconstruction. Further concerns of recurrent epithelial pearls and implantation cholesteatoma can be currently addressed by follow-up MR scanning.

AB  - Titanium middle ear (ME) prostheses are widely used in surgical practice due to their acoustic properties. However, they present a significant drawback shared by all synthetic materials currently in use for ME reconstruction: they can be rejected by the organism of the host. In this study, we aim to review the current literature on titanium partial ossicular replacement prostheses (PORPs) and total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORPs) extrusion and dislocation. Eighty articles were analysed after a full article review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most common indication for reconstruction was chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. The average extrusion or dislocation rate was 5.2%, ranging from 0 to 35%. The average improvements in the air-bone gap were 12.1 dB (1.6 dB to 25.1 dB) and 13.8 (-0.5 dB to 22.7 dB) for the PORP and TORP groups, respectively. The data reported on this topic are highly variable, demonstrating that functional outcomes are difficult to predict in clinical practice. We believe that the current limitations could be overcome with technological developments, including bioengineering research focused on promoting prosthesis adaptation to the ME environment.

Material and methods: We retrospectively analyzed 74 patients who had undergone endoscopic butterfly cartilage myringoplasty were followed for at least five years. The evaluation included age, sex, duration of follow-up, perforation location, size, preoperative and postoperative pure tone audiometry thresholds (years 2 and 5), air-bone gap, follow-up complications, and postoperative graft and tympanic membrane status. Results: The study included 74 patients with a mean follow-up duration of 76.7 months (range: 60-125 months). The graft success rates were 89.1% at two years and 82.4% at five years postoperatively. There was a significant improvement in air conduction thresholds when comparing preoperative levels to those at two and five years postoperatively (p = 0.003). The air-bone gap showed a significant reduction from preoperative levels to those observed at two and five years postoperatively (p < 0.0001). Conclusion and significance: Our study demonstrates that endoscopic butterfly cartilage myringoplasty is safe and effective for achieving long-term anatomical and functional success. We recommend extending the follow-up period to five years with additional annual assessments thereafter.

AB  - In this paper, we report the postoperative outcomes in canal wall up procedures with second stage surgery in 40 children undergoing intervention for cholesteatoma of the middle ear. The residuals, recurrences and the hearing results were analysed. All 40 patients had a follow-up of at least five years. Of the 39 patients who underwent two staged surgery, 18 (46.1%) had a residual lesion that was identified and excised during the second surgery. Over a five year follow-up period, there were five (12.5%) patients with recurrences, all belonging to the group in whom a residual cholesteatoma was identified during the second staged surgery. The rate of residual cholesteatoma tends to decrease as age increases. The type of cholesteatoma, acquired or congenital middle ear, were not statistically related to the incidence of residual cholesteatoma. Hearing analysis showed that hearing recovery was excellent with canal wall up procedures and remained stable over five years.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the anatomic and functional outcomes of the different graft materials used in tympanoplasty. Settings and Design: This was an observational, cross-sectional study. Patients and Methods: The study included 243 patients operated at Tertiary Care University Hospital, from January 2011 to December 2015. The study excluded patients who had previous ear surgery and patients with cholesteatoma and nose and paranasal sinuses diseases. Tympanoplasty was done under general anesthesia. The retroauricular approach was primarily used. All grafts were placed using the underlay technique. Audiological testing of all patients was done preoperatively and postoperatively. Statistical Analysis Used: All data were entered into Excel and analyzed using MedCalc Statistical Software version 15.8 (MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium). Descriptive statistics was used. Audiological findings were compared using a paired t-test. The value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The temporal fascia was used as the graft material in 160 patients, and tragal perichondrium was used in 83 patients. Improvement of audiological outcome in patients with temporal fascia amounted 62.5% and in patients with perichondrium amounted 60.24%. The graft success rate 3 months postoperatively was 92.5% in the fascia group whereas it was 95.18% in the perichondrium group. Conclusion: Improvement of audiological outcome was slightly better (62.5%) in the fascia group while graft acceptance in the postoperative period was slightly better (95.18%) in the perichondrium group.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the impact of allograft and xenograft in pediatric tympanoplasty on patient outcomes. Methods: A retrospective cohort study of 50 pediatric patients undergoing tympanoplasty at a single tertiary pediatric hospital system that received either autograft, allograft, or xenograft. Patients were evaluated for persistent perforation, recurrent perforation, revision surgery, and postoperative infection. Hearing outcomes, operative charges, and operative time were also evaluated. Statistical analyses included chi-square and Fisher exact tests for categorical data and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests for continuous data. Results: Half of the cohort received autografts, whereas 38% received xenografts and 14% received allografts. Although there was not a significant difference in charges associated with these procedures, xenografts had the shortest mean operative time (mean: 39 vs 68 minutes in autografts, p = .05). Overall, the rate of persistent perforation was 10%, recurrent perforation was 20%, revision surgery was 16%, and postoperative infection was 18%. There were no differences in the rates of these outcomes by graft type. Furthermore, there was no observed difference in hearing outcomes among autograft and xenograft recipients, but allograft recipients had significantly improved hearing postoperatively. Conclusions: Similar rates of complications were observed among autografts, xenografts, and allografts, providing preliminary evidence that they are safe to use in pediatric tympanoplasty.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the success rates and hearing outcomes of temporalis fascia and tragal cartilage grafts used for type-1 tympanoplasty in the elderly ((3)65 years)
   Methods: The medical records of 73 elderly patients who underwent type-1 tympanoplasty at our center between January 2010 and June 2017 were retrospectively reviewed for age, gender, perforation side, presence of contralateral perforation, type and location of perforation, graft material types, preoperative and postoperative hearing levels, and length of follow-up.
   Results: The graft success rate was 83.5% (61 patients) for the entire group, 76.2% (32 patients) for the fascia group, and 93.5% (29 patients) for the cartilage group. The success rate for the cartilage group was significantly higher than that for the fascia group (P = 0.048). The mean hearing gain was 12.5 +/- 7.6 and 8.9 +/- 6.1 dB in the fascia and cartilage groups, respectively, and postoperative ABG was 10 dB or better in 29 (69.0%) and 19 (61.3%) patients, respectively. The mean hearing gain was significantly higher in the fascia group than in the cartilage group (P = 0.028), whereas the mean ABG was significantly higher in the cartilage group than in the fascia group (P = 0.009). The functional success rates were similar in both groups (P = 0.490).
   Conclusion: Tympanoplasty is a safe and effective procedure in elderly patients with a 83.5% of graft success rate. Tragal cartilage may be the first choice of graft material due to its high success rates. The functional outcomes did not show significant differences between the fascia and cartilage groups.

AB  - Objective: To assess the prognostic value of pathologic and technical variables influencing the functional outcome of tympanoplasty.
   Patients and Study Design: Retrospective review of the records of 544 patients affected by chronic otitis with or without cholesteatoma, operated on by the senior author in a city hospital ENT department. Follow-up was provided systematically by the same institution
   Interventions: These included tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy in 339 cases, canal wall up technique in 134 cases, and canal wall down in 71 cases. Three hundred twenty-six (60%) were primary, and 218 (40%) were revision procedures. Myringoplasty was performed with autologous temporalis fascia, ossiculoplasty with incus interposition, or partial or total ossicular prostheses. Mean follow-up was 14 months (range, 12-50 months).
   Main Outcome Measures: Hearing results were defined according to the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium Guidelines. A one-way analysis of variance was used to determine group differences. Multiple logistic regression analysis was subsequently carried out on the different pathology groups via the hierarchical log linear model. A probability value of p < 0.05 was the level of si,significance.
   Results: The status of the mucosal lining, the mastoidectomy, the availability of the malleus handle, and the tympanic membrane perforation were all significancy predictive of the hearing outcome but with differing weight according to the pathologic condition.
   Conclusions: Anatomic and technical factors diversely affect the functional outcome of tympanoplasty. A better knowledge of their predictive roles and weights may be useful in both the surgeon's judgment and in the information given to the patient.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of platelet -rich fibrin (PRF) application in tympanoplasty procedures for patients with chronic otitis media (COM), assessing its influence on graft survival and healing time. Methods: In this prospective interventional study, conducted between January 2022 and June 2023, 80 patients diagnosed with COM were enrolled and divided into two groups. Group A underwent standard tympanic membrane repair using temporal fascia grafts (TFG), while Group B received TFG with adjunctive PRF application. The patients were observed and assessed over a 20 -week postoperative period. Results: The study showed a significant enhancement in graft survival rates in Group B (TFG+PRF), with only one residual perforation compared to seven in Group A (TFG alone) at 20 weeks (p=0.02534). Furthermore, Group B patients experienced faster healing, achieving 97.5% graft integrity at 10 and 20 weeks, in contrast to Group A's 87.5%. Conclusion: The application of PRF in tympanoplasty procedures for COM notably enhances graft stability and expedites the healing process. These findings suggest that PRF can be a valuable adjunct in otolaryngological surgeries, offering potential improvements in patient outcomes and surgical efficacy.

AB  - Objective: To describe an active auditory rehabilitation method (clip vibroplasty) for conductive or mixed hearing loss in cases of a preserved stapes superstructure.
   Patients: After temporal bone experiments, the new clip vibroplasty was clinically used in 4 patients with chronic otitis media.
   Interventions: A new titanium double clip device (clip vibroplasty) was developed for a standardized and effective coupling of the floating mass transducer of the Vibrant Soundbridge to the intact stapes. Temporal bone experiments using laser Doppler vibrometry were performed to evaluate the device's acoustic efficiency. The audiologic outcomes of the first 4 patients were analyzed. The subjective benefits and satisfaction were assessed using the standardized International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids in all patients.
   Main Outcome Measures: Transfer characteristics of laser Doppler vibrometry experiments; audiologic outcomes of the 4 patients.
   Results: In the temporal bone experiment, coupling of the FMT using the titanium double clip support produced transfer characteristics across all tested frequencies comparable to our former total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis or an optimal round window application. The intraoperative application of the clip vibroplasty was uneventful in all cases. No signs of prosthesis dislocation were noted within the follow-up period of approximately 12 months. The audiologic outcome of the first patients showed good hearing gain in pure-tone and speech audiometry, with results that are unobtainable using a conventional air conduction hearing aid.
   Conclusion: The concept of a partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis vibroplasty using a titanium clip support entails a straightforward procedure similar to a classic partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis tympanoplasty. The unoccluded ear canal and the superior auditory performance offer an advantageous application of this "power clip" in cases of chronic middle ear dysfunction.

AB  - Ossicular reconstruction using various materials from autograft to artificial prosthesis have a wide range of success and failure rates due to various reasons. In this article, a newer use of old grommet in ossicular reconstruction is attempted. A 50yr old lady presented with hearing loss in the right ear for one year. She gave a previous history of ear discharge 11 months back. There was no other positive history relevant to the case. On examination, the pars tensa was plastered and immobile on the left side. Her Pure tone audiometry showed conductive hearing loss on the left ear with average 55 db loss. Her CT showed absent incus with obliteration of middle ear-space and sclerosed mastoid. We planned for Tympanotomy. On elevating the flap, the incus and stapes were absent. Here we decided on a newer use for the grommet and used it as prosthesis. The result is good and promising with no complications. The grommet did not get extruded or produce granulation tissue. The ear is dry and the patient is still on follow up. The purpose of publishing this report is to identify a prosthesis that is cost-effective and readily available. The grommet has been used for a more extended period for other indications,but as a prosthesis for reconstruction is a new method and requires further studies.

AB  - Objectives: To identify the predictors of tympanoplasty success including graft success, hearing outcomes, and recovery time. Methods: Patients who underwent a tympanoplasty between January 2019 and July 2022 were enrolled. Hearing outcomes were measured by air-bone gap from pure tone. Demographic data of the patient, surgical parameters, and Ossiculoplasty Outcome Parameter Staging (OOPS) were reviewed and evaluated to predict the success of tympanoplasty using univariate and multivariate logistic or Cox regression analyzes. Results: Of 138 patients, 151 procedures were studied. At the 6-month follow-up visit, the overall graft success was 90.7% and the overall hearing success was 40.4%. There was a correlation between the OOPS index and postoperative hearing success (Spearman r= 0.322). Blood loss > 10 ml and OOPS = 4 were independent predictors of hearing failure. Blocked aditus ad antrum and blood loss > 10 ml were independent predictors of prolonged recovery time. Conclusions: The OOPS index exhibits a strong predictive influence on hearing outcomes after tympanoplasty.

AB  - Objective Manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty functional outcomes were compared to those of other methods for reconstructing Austin-Kartush type B ossicular defects. Methods Forty-two patients underwent Austin-Kartush type B ossicular defect reconstruction using: manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty (13 patients), an autologous incus (19 patients) or a titanium ossicular replacement prosthesis (10 patients). For manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty reconstruction, the malleus head was removed, the manubrium was relocated posteriorly and the incus short process was placed on the mobile footplate. The manubrium was placed on the incus body groove and bone cement was applied to stabilise the manubrium-incus junction. Pre- and post-operative hearing thresholds were assessed. Results The air-bone gap decreased from 25.9 +/- 6.0 dB to 12.3 +/- 5.0 dB (p < 0.05) in the manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty group. The hearing gain was 13.6 +/- 5.2 dB for manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty, 3.4 +/- 14.2 dB with the autologous incus, and 3.3 +/- 11.07 dB with the titanium ossicular replacement prosthesis. Hearing improvement was greater for manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty compared to the other reconstruction methods (p < 0.05). Conclusion Manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty resulted in satisfactory hearing outcomes in patients with Austin-Kartush type B ossicular defects. This technique can be considered a stable, inexpensive and effective method to reconstruct Austin-Kartush type B ossicular defects.

AB  - Objective: Evaluation of the audiological patient performance with an upgrade of the firmware from the fixed feedback canceller (FFC) to the adaptive feedback canceller (AFC) on an active middle ear implant. Study Design: Retrospective observational nonrandomized group study. Setting: Private hospital. Patients/Intervention(s): From March 2018 to September 2019, 15 patients implanted with an active middle ear implant, with 6 or more months of experience with a FFC system, were upgraded to an AFC algorithm. Main Outcome Measure(s): Functional gain, speech perception in silence and in noise, and sound localization capacities were examined. Feedback reduction was also analyzed. Results: Thirteen patients were analyzed. Pure tone audiometric evaluation with FFC (mean value of 48.02 dB) compared with AFC at 1 (mean value of 49.12 dB) and 6 months (mean value of 42.75 dB) revealed no statistically significant differences (p = 0.889 and p = 0.358 respectively). In speech discrimination in silence, clinically relevant improvements were observed with AFC at 1 and 6 months, with a mean value of 41.5 and 38.3 dB, respectively (p = 0.03 and p = 0.021 correspondingly). In speech discrimination in noisy environments, we observed an improvement of the different conditions tested. No differences were found in localization capacities between FFC and AFC at the two different moments of evaluation. Conclusions: AFC is more effective than FFC in cancelling feedback and improving sound quality, allowing for better speech understanding in silence and in noise.

AB  - Objective: To present the experience in cartilage island graft tympanoplasty for advanced middle ear pathologies and evaluate its success rate and audiologic results.
   Materials and Methods: The charts of patients who underwent cartilage island graft tympanoplasty for advanced middle ear disease from September 2006 to March 2009 were reviewed and only oto-endoscopy assisted intact canal wall (ICW) / type 3 tympanoplasty procedures have been included in this study. Reviewed parameters were graft take, change between the pre- and post operative pure tone average air bone gap (PTA-ABG) and complications. Audio logic evaluation was made among the patients whom complete ear drum closure was achieved
   Results: Of the 36 procedures, 63.9% were for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, 11.1% for chronic otitis media with polyp, 25% for adhesive otitis/retraction pocket with or without cholesteatoma. TORP was used in 14 cases and PORP in 22. Graft take was achieved 88.9% of the patients. There were two attic perforation with cholesteatoma and two anterior perforation. The overall pre-and postoperative PTA-ABG were 28.91 +/- 8.73 dB and 10.42 +/- 6.10 dB. PORP subgroups had a statistically signifcant better hearing results at 0.5 kHz, 4.0 kHz and average.
   Conclusion: Results in our study indicate that cartilage island graft is a reliable material in advanced middle ear pathologies with satisfactory anatomical - functional outcomes and it reduces the risk of retraction pockets which can lead to recurrent cholesteatoma.

AB  - ObjectivesTo evaluate and compare functional outcomes of tympanoplasty procedures with temporalis fascia and four different types of cartilage grafts in chronic otitis media (COM) cases with normal preoperative hearing levels.MethodsRecords of patients who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty for non-complicated COM in a tertiary medical center between January 2010 and January 2017 were reviewed. Patients with central or marginal and dry perforations of the tympanic membrane, normal middle ear mucosa, intact ossicular chain and patients with a preoperative pure tone average (PTA) level of 25dB or less and a word recognition score (WRS) of 88% or greater were included in the study. Graft success rates, preoperative and postoperative functional outcomes, and anatomical results were analyzed.ResultsOne hundred and forty-four patients who met the inclusion criteria were evaluated in the study. PTA and Air-bone gap (ABG) levels decreased significantly both in TF and CG groups after the surgery (p=0.001). Similarly, WRS scores increased significantly in both groups (p=0.001). There was not a significant difference in terms of PTA increase, WRS increase, and ABG closure levels between cartilage and TF groups. Increase in PTA, closure in ABG, and increase in WRS levels were compared among TF, WsCCG, MCG, PCG, and CPIG groups. The increase in PTA levels was also found to be significantly superior in the TF group (p=0,023). However, the multivariate analysis showed no significant difference for increase in WRS, closure in ABG and increase in PTA levels according to graft type (p=0.285; p=0.461; p=0.106, respectively) and gender (p=0.487; p=0.811; p=0.756, respectively).ConclusionIn COM cases with normal preoperative hearing, both TF and cartilage lead to superb functional and anatomical outcomes. There was not a significant difference in terms of PTA increase, WRS increase and ABG closure levels between cartilage and TF groups. The graft success rate of cartilage was found to be superior to TF, but there was not a statistically significant difference. Different types of cartilage grafts can be used in cases with normal preoperative hearing without the concern of hearing impairment.

AB  - Background: Inflammatory conditions such as chronic otitis media (COM) can cause irreversible impairments in the microarchitecture and functions of the incus, which subsequently leads to conductive hearing loss.
   Objectives: To investigate bone mineral density (BMD) of the incus body (IB) and long process (ILP) on preoperative temporal CT in COM patients with and without incudo-stapedial joint discontinuity (ISJD), and also to determine the association between BMD values and the postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) in the ISJD group.
   Material and methods: The mean IB density (IBD)/occipital bone density (OBD) and ILP density (ILPD)/OBD values were compared between the patients with and without ISJD. The correlation between ABG gain and preoperative incus density values was assessed in the ISJD group.
   Results: The mean IBD/OBD and ILPD/OBD values were significantly higher in patients with intact ISJ. There was a moderate positive correlation between postoperative ABG gain and ILPD/OBD values in the ISJD group.
   Conclusion and significance: The decrease in BMD of the incus may involve ILP as well as IB in patients with ISJD caused by ILP lysis in COM. A higher preoperative ILPD/OBD was correlated with a higher postoperative ABG gain in COM patients with ISJD.

AB  - From 1975 to 1992, a total of 1459 primary stapedoplasty operations (i.e., stapedectomy, stapedotomy with tendon section, and stapedotomy with tendon preservation) were performed in 1323 subjects at the Ear,Nose, and Throat Department of the University of Verona. Pure-tone audiometry was carried out in all subjects who were operated on and who underwent 6-month and 10-year follow-ups. To evaluate the influence of stapedius tendon preservation on functional outcome, we randomly selected subgroups of patients using the three different stapedioplasty techniques and tested them by multiple-frequency tympanometry, psychoacoustic tuning curves, and speech discrimination in noise. Finally, to assess the effect of prosthesis diameter on middle ear transfer function, we used the electrocochleographic technique and examined the threshold and latency of cochlear nerve compound action potentials recorded during surgery from the round window. The results of this study show that the best auditory performance in otosclerotic subjects is achieved by performing a stapedotomy of 0.7 mm diameter, using a 0.6 wire-Teflon piston, and preserving the stapedius tendon.

AB  - To study functional outcome of the endoscopic management of limited attico-antral cholesteatoma in terms of visualization of sac, cholesteatoma disease clearance, ABG closure improvement, preservation of residual anatomy and recurrence of disease. It is a prospective study done during Feb 2016 to March 2017 done on 20 pts with limited attico-antral cholesteatoma with CT confirmation. Endoscopic management of limited attico-antral cholesteatoma with complete removal of sac, infected discharge and granulations along with creation of MRMC Neo surgical ventilating port (joining Anterior & posterior isthmuses) done in cases where residual attic anatomy was present to establish physiological attic ventilation and drainage. Whereas in cases of attic and ossicular erosion, ossiculoplasty along with neo attic malleo-incudal complex (with composite tragal cartilage with perichondrium graft) for lateral attic wall reconstruction was done to prevent attic retraction. Patients had mean pre op ABG of 36.29 +/- 6.29 and mean post op ABG closure of 16.33 +/- 6.50 with no recurrence of cholesteatoma at 6 months of follow up. Patient showed significant (55%) improvement in hearing with all having graft uptake in which four cases having mild pars tensa retraction which recovered later without any intervention. Thus creation of new MRMC Neo surgical ventilating port or neo attic malleo-incudal complex with endoscopic approach allows better visual access to clear the limited attico-antral disease with sparing of normal residual attic anatomy along with physiological ventilation and drainage having better hearing results and outcome.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study aims to evaluate the necessity of ear packing in otological operations where the annulus fibrosus is not elevated, focusing on graft success rates and postoperative hearing outcomes.MethodsA randomized controlled prospective clinical trial was conducted at a tertiary care hospital involving 200 patients aged 18 years and above undergoing myringoplasty for inactive chronic suppurative otitis media. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ear packing with absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam (R)) or no packing. The primary outcome is graft success assessed via microscopic examination at 3 and 6 months post-surgery. Secondary outcomes include hearing gains measured by pure-tone audiometry at 500-, 1000-, 2000-, and 4000-Hz frequencies.ResultsAt 3 months, the graft take rate was 92% in the ear packing group and 90% in the no packing group, with no statistically significant difference (p = 0.63). At 6 months, the graft take rate was 90% in the packing group and 88% in the no packing group (p = 0.67). Hearing improvements, as measured by air conduction thresholds, were also similar between the two groups (p = 0.73).ConclusionThis study demonstrates that myringoplasty without ear packing yields comparable graft take rates and hearing improvements to traditional myringoplasty with ear packing. These findings suggest that omitting ear packing in appropriate cases may simplify the procedure without compromising patient outcomes.

AB  - Hypothesis: Tight fixation of stapes prostheses yields better functional results because sound transmission from the incus to the prosthesis is improved.
   Background: The optimal prosthesis to use for otosclerosis surgery is still a matter of debate. It has been proposed that using prostheses made of Nitinol, a shape-memory metal, produces better functional results with less variability and reduced risk for middle and inner ear damage. This is thought to be because heat activation rather than manual crimping of the prosthesis loop forms a tighter fixation.
   Methods: Functional results of two groups were compared 1 year after surgery. In one group were 75 cases of stapedotomy performed using Nitinol prostheses. Results were analyzed prospectively and compared with 75 retrospectively analyzed matched controls with conventional stapes prostheses. Crimping quality was measured in 23 patients by intraoperative laser Doppler interferometry (LDI). Causality was assessed by correlating results of intraoperative LDI and postoperative pure-tone thresholds.
   Results: Nitinol and conventional prostheses yielded postoperative air-bone gaps (ABGs) of 8.0 and 11.6 dB with 71 and 43% ABG closure within 10 dB, respectively. Intraoperatively, sound transmission was improved by 2.5 dB with the Nitinol prostheses as compared with conventional prostheses. These differences were statistically significant. Intraoperative fixation quality was positively correlated to functional outcome, but results were not statistically significant.
   Conclusion: Tight fixation, as provided by Nitinol prostheses leads to improved functional results because of better sound transmission properties at the incus-prosthesis interface. The improvement in ABG closure is in the range of 3 dB pure-tone average and more pronounced at higher frequencies. Nitinol prostheses provide an effective treatment option in otosclerosis surgery.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate both audiological and tinnitus related results in patients with tinnitus undergoing ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR) for ossicular chain injury. Methods: Between January 2015 and January 2019, patients who underwent OCR due to ossicular chain pathology and developed tinnitus symptoms were included in the study group. Middle ear pathologies were standardized using the middle ear risk index (MERI) scoring system and the tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) was used to determine the severity of tinnitus. The surgical methods used for reconstruction were partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) or total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP), depending on the patient's pathology. Results: The study group consisted of 43 patients aged between 34 and 65 years. Mean MERI score of the patients was 6.42 +/- 2.52. When assessed categorically, 18.6% of the study group was identified in the 'mild', 46.5% were in the 'moderate', and 34.5% were in the 'severe' MERI category. Patients in the TORP group and those who were undergoing second session OCR had higher MERI and preop THI scores. Post-operative tinnitus levels were higher in patients who had OCR in the second session and were in the severe risk group. The ABG and tinnitus scores of patients were found to improve with OCR. In patients who underwent TORP, both ABG and tinnitus scores decreased significantly. Whereas, in patients who underwent PORP, only ABG values decreased significantly. After OCR, both ABG value and tinnitus scores significantly decreased compared to pre-operative results. ABG recovery rate was 100% in the study group. Conclusion: It can be said that OCR positively changes both audiological parameters and tinnitus levels in ossicular chain pathologies.

AB  - Cartilage is the grafting material of choice in advanced disorders of the middle ear while the indications for its routine use remain controversial due to the possible detrimental effect on post-operative hearing. Aim of the present study was to report personal experience with "tragal cartilage shield" tympanoplasty. The study focused on 306 adult patients (236 primary procedures and 70 revisions from January 2003 to June 2007). Mean post-operative follow-up was 37 months (range 1-66). The following parameters were evaluated: graft take, change between the pre-and post-operative pure-tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG), post-operative complications. Graft take was achieved in 304 patients (99.35%) and there were no immediate post-operative complications. The overall average pre-operative pure-tone average air-bone gap was 43.79 +/- 7.07 dB, whereas the post-operative (1 year after surgery) pure-tone average air-bone gap was 10.43 +/- 5.25 dB (p < 0.0001). Statistically significant improvement was observed up to 5 years after surgery. This study reveals that tragal cartilage shield tympanoplasty is a reliable technique, in fact it has a high degree of graft take and hearing results are satisfactory. Furthermore, the cartilage is a satisfactory grafting material because it is easily accessible, easy to adapt, resistant to negative middle ear pressures, stable, elastic, well tolerated by the middle ear, resistant to resorption. Therefore, we also recommend its use in less severe middle ear disorders, in which the functional outcome is more essential.

AB  - Objective: To present the long-term surgical outcome of the bony mastoid and epitympanic obliteration technique with canal wall reconstruction (CWR-BOT) in adults with an unstable cavity after previous canal wall-down surgery for extensive cholesteatoma.
   Study Design: Retrospective study.
   Interventions: Therapeutic.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: Fifty consecutive adult patients undergoing a CWR-BOT between 1998 and 2009.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): (A) Recurrence and residual rates of cholesteatoma, (B) postoperative hygienic status of the ear, including postoperative aspect of the tympanic membrane and external ear canal integrity (EAC), (C) functional outcome, and (D) long-term safety issues.
   Results: (A) The percentage of ears remaining safe without recurrent or residual disease after CWR-BOT was 96% after a mean follow-up time of 101.8 months. Recurrent cholesteatoma occurred in 2% (n = 1) and a residual cholesteatoma was detected in 2% (n = 1) of the patients. (B) A safe dry, and trouble-free graft and selfcleaning EAC was achieved in 94%. (C) The postoperative hearing results showed a gain of 1.7 dB on pure-tone average air-conduction. (D) Nonecho planar diffusion-weighted imaging (non-EP DW magnetic resonance imaging) documented the residual (n = 1) and recurrent cholesteatoma (n = 1). The 1- and 5-year imaging follow-up revealed no other recurrent or residual disease.
   Conclusion: The CWR-BOT is a safe and very effective option for treatment of problematic unstable canal wall-down mastoid cavities, resulting in dry trouble-free ears.

AB  - Objective: To identify prognostic factors affecting outcome in lateral tympanoplasty for total or neartotal tympanic membrane perforation. Study Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Patients were those presenting with total or near-total tympanic membrane perforation undergoing lateral tympanoplasty from 1999 to 2004. We systematically collected demographic, clinical, audiologic, and outcome information. Student t test was used to determine group differences. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between success of grafting (dependent variable) and the independent variables. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) and independent variables. Results: There were seventy-seven cases (58 primary and 19 revision cases) with average follow-up of 17 months. Successful tympanic membrane grafting occurred in 91% of cases. None of the independent variables studied was predictive of the success of graft incorporation (P >.05). The mean preoperative ABG was 29.8 +/- 10 dB and improved to a postoperative ABG of 16.5 +/- 11 dB (P <.001). Smaller preoperative ABG and normal malleus handle were associated with smaller postoperative ABG. In revision cases, mastoidectomy was associated with better functional results. Conclusions: Successful grafting of near-total and total tympanic membrane perforations occurred in 91% of the cases and was independent of demographic, disease, and technical variables. Disease variables (preoperative ABG and status of malleus handle) had a greater prognostic value on postoperative ABG than other variables. In revision tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy is associated with a better functional outcome.

AB  - Introduction: Myringoplasty remains a topical subject. Our study aims at analyzing the anatomical and functional results of cartilaginous myringoplasty, and also determining the main factors that could influence its results.Materials and methods: A retrospective study of 51 cases of tympanic perforations operated at the ENT department of the Hassan II University Hospital of Fez between January 2018 and November 2021. Only the patients with exclusive cartilage myringoplasty were included. The anatomical and functional results of cartilage myringoplasty were evaluated and analyzed according to several variables. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS Statistics software.Results: The average age of our patients was 35, with a sex ratio of 2.45. The perforation was anterior in 58%, posterior in 12%, and central in 30% of the cases. The average pre-operative audiometric air bone gap (ABG) was 29.3 dB. The most commonly used graft was the conchal cartilage in 89% of cases. A complete cicatrization has been noticed in 92%, and at six months after surgery, a complete closure of the ABG has been observed in 43% of cases, a significant hearing improvement with an ABG between 11 and 20 dB in 24%, a hearing recovery with an ABG between 21 and 30 dB in 21%, and an ABG > 30 dB in 12% of the cases. A statically significant relationship (p<0.05) has been found between the functional or anatomical failure of the myringoplasty; the different predictive factors were: the young age (less than 16 years), the inflammatory state of the tympanic cavity, the anterior location, and large size of the perforation.Conclusion: Cartilaginous myringoplasty provides good anatomical and auditory results. The pre-operative predictive factors, such as age, complete and sufficient drying of the ear, the size and location of the perforation, and the size of the used cartilage, should all be considered for a better anatomical and functional outcome.

AB  - We aim to demonstrate that regeneration of chronic tympanic perforations with heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) delivered by an injectable hydrogel restored hearing to levels similar to that of nonperforated tympanic membranes. Chronic tympanic membrane perforation is currently managed as an outpatient surgery with tympanoplasty. Due to the costs of this procedure in the developed world and a lack of accessibility and resources in developing countries, there is a great need for a new treatment that does not require surgery. In this study, we show in a mouse model through measurement of auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emissions that tympanic perforations lead to hearing loss and this can be predominantly recovered with HB-EGF treatment (5 mg/mL). Our animal model suggests a return to function between 2 and 6 months after treatment. Auditory brainstem response thresholds had returned to the control levels at 2 months, but the distortion product otoacoustic emissions returned between 2 and 6 months. We also show how the vibration characteristics of the regenerated tympanic membrane, as measured by laser Doppler vibrometry, can be similar to that of an unperforated tympanic membrane. Using the best available methods for preclinical evaluation in animal models, it is likely that HB-EGF-like growth factor treatment leads to regeneration of chronic tympanic membrane perforations and restoration of the tympanic membrane to normal function, suggesting a potential route for nonsurgical treatment.

AB  - Objective: To compare anatomic and functional outcomes of the different graft materials used in pediatric tympanoplasty.
   Materials and methods: The patients younger than 18 years of age and who had tympanoplasty between 2010 and 2012 were included in the study. Temporal muscle fascia or cartilage was used as the graft material. The age, gender, the side of the operated ear, the operation technique, pre- and postoperative audiological results, and the status of the graft were noted. An intact graft and an air-bone gap (ABG) <= 20 were regarded as surgical success in the postoperative period. Audiograms obtained before surgery and 1 year after surgery were used for the comparison.
   Results: Sixty pediatric cases were included in the study. Fascia graft was used as the graft material in 35 of them, and cartilage was used in 25 patients. The graft success rate was 82.9% in the fascia group while it was 92% in the cartilage group. In the fascia group preoperative ABG was 28.2 +/- 10.1 dB, postoperative ABG was 15.1 +/- 10.2 dB, and postoperative gain was 13.1 +/- 9.6 dB. In the cartilage group, preoperative ABG was 28.9 +/- 10.2 dB, and postoperative ABG was 16.8 +/- 10.3 dB with a postoperative gain of 12.1 +/- 6.8 dB. The differences between the fascia and the cartilage groups were not statistically significant either for hearing gain or graft success rate.
   Conclusion: Cartilage and fascia grafts yield similar results for hearing gain and graft success rate in pediatric tympanoplasty. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the safety and performance of three novel vibroplasty couplers that allow attachment of the floating mass transducer of a transcutaneous active middle ear implant (AMEI) to the round window (RW) membrane, the long process (LP), or the incus body and the short process (SP) of the incus. Methods Retrospective multicenter cohort study of 25 AMEI users with sensorineural or mixed hearing loss that were among the first implanted with an AMEI vibrating ossicular prosthesis in combination with the third generation of vibroplasty couplers between 2014 and 2016. Main Outcome Measures were bone-conduction pure-tone and vibroplasty thresholds, postoperative aided sound field thresholds and postoperative aided word recognition score (WRS). Results Bone conduction threshold changes of more than 10 dB in 4PTA(BC) were observed in two subjects. A mean improvement of 57.8% in speech recognition was observed with a mean WRS at 65 dB SPL improving from 14.8% (SD 21.9%) preoperatively to a mean aided score of 72.6% (SD 18.6%). Sound field thresholds improved from an average 4PTA(SF) of 64.1 dB HL (SD 9.8 dB HL) to 37.0 dB HL (SD 8.9 dB HL), resulting in a mean functional gain of 27.1 dB. There was no significant difference in WRS or functional gain between the coupler types. Conclusion Initial experience shows that all three third generation vibroplasty couplers represent safe and efficient attachment options for the FMT allowing the surgeon to choose the coupling type based on the present pathology.

AB  - Objectives: We compared the functional outcomes of fat myringoplasty and areolar tympanoplasty through a small postauricular incision in patients who underwent transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES). Methods: The study included patients who underwent myringoplasty or type I tympanoplasty using TEES in our Department of Otolaryngology between April 2016 and May 2019. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the type of graft material used, which was selected based on the available amount of subcutaneous fat and the surgeon's experience. Results: In total, 63 patients received fat tissue grafts (group A) and 77 received areolar tissue grafts (group B). The median operative time was significantly longer in group B (132 minutes) than in group A (65 minutes); perforations were significantly larger in group B than in group A (61.0% vs 29.7% of the eardrum surface). The postoperative air conduction threshold, air-bone gap, and speech reception threshold values were significantly lower than the preoperative values in both groups. The graft success rate did not significantly differ between groups A (96.8%, 61/63) and B (96.1%, 74/77). In group A, the perforation was > 35% of the eardrum surface in 27.0% (17/63) of the patients; the graft success rate was 100% (17/17). In the remaining 46 patients (perforation > 35%), the graft success rate was 95.7% (44/46); this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Transcanal endoscopic ear surgery increases the usefulness of fat myringoplasty for the repair of perforations > 35% of the eardrum surface. Postauricular fatty and areolar tissues are suitable for this simple and rapid technique, which yields excellent outcomes.

AB  - Chronic otitis media (COM) poses significant challenges globally, affecting millions with hearing impairment and associated morbidities. This prospective study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes of type I tympanoplasty with and without canaloplasty in adolescent patients with COM, focusing on hearing improvement and graft success rates. Sixty-eight patients aged 11-18 years, diagnosed with inactive mucosal disease and conductive hearing loss, were enrolled from 01 January 2022 to 01 July 2023. They were randomly assigned to Group A (type I tympanoplasty with canaloplasty, n = 34) or Group B (type I tympanoplasty alone, n = 34). Preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluations were conducted to assess air-bone gap closure and hearing thresholds. Graft uptake was evaluated at three months post-surgery. Both groups showed significant improvement in hearing postoperatively (p < 0.01). Group A exhibited a higher rate of successful graft uptake (94.11%) compared to Group B (91.17%), though this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.01). Canaloplasty in Group A facilitated enhanced visualization of the tympanic membrane and improved graft placement, contributing to favorable outcomes. The study underscores the potential benefits of combining canaloplasty with type I tympanoplasty in adolescent patients with COM, emphasizing improved hearing outcomes and graft success rates. These findings support the incorporation of canaloplasty to optimize surgical outcomes and enhance patient outcomes in chronic otitis media management.

AB  - Objective: To describe a new titanium clip prosthesis for partial ossicular reconstruction with a micro ball joint in the headplate for compensation of tympanic membrane displacements.
   Patients: Laboratory experiments followed by 18 consecutive patients.
   Interventions: A micro ball joint was implemented into a headplate of titanium middle ear prosthesis. First, the new prosthesis was tested in the laboratory in temporal bone experiments. Second, the new prosthesis was clinically installed in 18 patients.
   Outcome Measures: Results of laser Doppler vibrometry and force measurements in the laboratory experiments, analysis of a questionnaire, and preoperative and postoperative pure tone audiometry.
   Results: The frictional resistance in the joint was measured to be 12 mN that should allow for adequate mobility under physiologic conditions. The effective sound transmission of the prosthesis was demonstrated by laser Doppler vibrometry. Intraoperatively, the installation of the prosthesis was always straightforward with headplate prosthesis shaft angles between 60 and 90 degrees. Postoperatively, pure tone audiometry revealed satisfying hearing results with a remaining average air-bone gap of 18.2 dB over the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 Hz. No signs of prosthesis dislocation were discovered within the follow-up period of approximately 6 months.
   Conclusion: The experimental data show that the new modified prosthesis headplate fulfills the requirements necessary for sound transmission. The joint allows the plate to follow movements of the tympanic membrane. This characteristic in conjunction with the proven clip design ensure for optimal prosthesis placement and effectiveness.

AB  - Background. This study aimed to explore the impacts of different middle-ear mucosal conditions on the outcomes of type I tympanoplasty. Methods. A retrospective analysis of 164 patients with chronic otitis media was carried out. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to their mucosal condition. Preoperative hearing levels and air-bone gap (ABG) before and after surgery were compared via the Kruskal-Wallis H test. The chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used to assess the postoperative complications and impact factors of functional success. Results. Preoperatively, neither the air conduction nor bone conduction values differed significantly among groups with different mucosal conditions. All of the ABG closed dramatically after type I tympanoplasty (P < .05) regardless of the mucosal conditions. The functional success rates were lower when the intratympanic mucosa was moderately or severely edematous compared with mildly edematous or normal (P < .05). The disease course, perforation site, and perforation size, as well as the status of the opposite ear, were not related to the auditory functional outcome. The differences in postoperative reotorrhea and reperforation among the 4 groups were not statistically significant. Conclusion. Preoperative hearing levels were not affected by middle-ear mucosal conditions. The functional success rate was influenced by mucosal conditions, but hearing levels were significantly enhanced after surgical intervention regardless of the mucosal status. Postoperative complications were not related to the mucosal conditions. Thus, type I tympanoplasty is adoptable for mucosal abnormalities when pharmacotherapy cannot result in a healthy tympanum.

AB  - Objective. The objective of this study was to analyze functional results after stapes surgery in patients with congenital nonprogressive conductive deafness resulting from an isolated fixation of the stapes according to age and surgical procedure. Study Design: The authors conducted a retrospective case series from March 1993 to December 2003 in patients from two tertiary referral centers. Methods. Twenty-eight patients were operated on by stapedotomy or partial stapedectomy using Teflon stapes prostheses. The median age at surgery was 14.2 years (range, 8.3-29.1 years). Main outcome measures were clinical and andiometric evaluation before and after surgery. Mean air conduction (MAC) and bone conduction (MBC) thresholds were recorded at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz. The evaluation of functional outcome was based on the MAC gain, the MBC comparison, and the mean postoperative and residual air-bone gaps. Results: The median preoperative MAC was 50 dB (range, 19.0-65.0 dB) with a 35.0 dB median dB air-bone gap. With a mean follow up of 19 months, postoperative hearing improvement was statistically significant: median gain of 32.5 dB (P <.001) and median residual airbone gap of 3.5 dB. The MEC was also statistically improved with median pre- and postoperative MBC of 11.5 and 6.5 dB, respectively (P <.001). Results were not dependent on the age group or type of surgery (stapedotomy or partial stapedectomy). No perceptive hearing loss was observed despite one gusher case. Conclusion: Surgical treatment of isolated congenital stapes ankylosis allows good functional results regardless of age or type of surgery.

AB  - Introduction Myringoplasty is a common otologic procedure to restore the integrity of the tympanic membrane in cases of traumatic or pathologic perforations. Many grafting materials have been used with different techniques. Objective In the present work, we evaluate the surgical and audiological outcomes of periosteal graft overlying the mastoid cortex through a retroauricular incision in a pediatric cohort. Methods A retrospective study was carried out involving all children aged <= 16 years who underwent periosteal graft myringoplasty for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media with dry central perforation in our hospital from April 2019 to April 2021. All patients were followed up for one year to assess the anatomical success and functional outcomes by comparing the preoperative and postoperative (after six months) results of pure tone audiometry (PTA). Results The sample was composed of 36 patients; 20 of them were female (55.6%) and 16 were male (44.4%) subjects, with ages ranging from 7 to 16 (mean: 12.7) years. Four patients underwent surgery in both ears (with an interval of 6 to 9 months). Out of 40 surgeries performed, 38 ears have shown anatomical success (95%). A highly significant improvement in hearing was obtained (the mean difference between the pre- and postoperative results of the PTA was of 14.63.45dB ( p <0.001). Conclusion We advocate the use of periosteal graft in the pediatric population as a good alternative for other types of grafts, with comparable and even better functional and anatomical outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effect of Korner's septum (KS) on graft success and hearing in patients who were treated with type 1 tympanoplasty.
   Study Design: An observational study.
   Place and Duration of Study: Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Health Sciences, Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, from July 2013 to July 2018.
   Methodology: Patients undergoing type 1 tympanoplasty were divided into 2 groups as patients with KS and without KS (WKS), according to the findings of high-resolution computed tomography of the temporal bone. Two different grafts (fascia and cartilage) in two groups (KS and WKS) were compared for graft success rate of different graft materials and pre- and postoperative hearing levels. The effect of the presence of KS on hearing was examined.
   Results: The anatomical graft success rate of type 1 tympanoplasty was 75.9% in the KS group and 88.5% in the WKS group (p = 0.026). In the presence of KS, graft success rate decreased with the use of a fascia graft (p = 0.044). In the presence of KS, the use of cartilage graft did not affect functional hearing; whereas, poor functional outcomes were obtained in ears operated using a temporalis fascia graft in the KS group than in the WKS group (p = 0.003).
   Conclusion: KS adversely affects graft success in type 1 tympanoplasty. Cartilage should be preferred as the graft material for patients with KS.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is an ongoing debate whether tympanoplasty should be performed in the pediatric age group. The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the anatomical and functional outcomes of type I cartilage tympanoplasty in children and adults.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: The file records of patients who underwent type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 133 patients who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media were included. Tragal cartilage grafts were used in all patients. The patients were divided into two groups: pediatric (age <= 16 years, n=54) and adult (age>18 years, n=79) groups. The graft success rates and hearing results between the two groups were compared.
   RESULTS: The graft success rate was 90.2% (120/133) in the study group. At the end of the 24-month follow-up, the graft was intact in 48 of the 54 (88.9%) patients in the pediatric group and 72 of the 79 patients in the adult group (91.1%) (p=0.769). The functional success rate (postoperative air-bone gap< 20 dB) obtained in the study group was 90.2% (120/133). The functional success rate was 88.9% (48/54) in the pediatric group and 91.1% (72/79) in the adult group (p=0.255).
   CONCLUSION: The graft success rates and hearing results obtained with cartilage grafts are similar in children and adults. Therefore, cartilage grafts may be safely used in pediatric patients, similar to their use in adults.

AB  - Prostheses replacing the incus in its normal position and equipped with two joints might transfer sound as effectively as the intact ossicular chain and allow adjustment to quasi-static pressure changes. A prerequisite for prostheses development is the access to dimensions and distances of the ossicular chain which are necessary to conceptualize shape and size. Fifteen cadaveric human temporal bone specimens were investigated by means of micro-CT followed by 3D analysis. Each specimen was scanned three times: after removal of incus, after additional removal of the malleus head, and after approaching the umbo to the promontory. Artificial umbo medialization as a surrogate for quasi-static pressure changes leads to relevant variations in the distance between the upper part of the malleus and the stapes. Prostheses replacing the incus in its normal position should be equipped with a sliding ball joint or similar construction to allow adjustment to quasi-static pressure changes.

AB  - Objective: The timing of tympanoplasty in the pediatric age group is an ongoing debate. The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the success of grafts in type 1 tympanoplasty in pediatric patients, and to evaluate the prognostic factors that may affect its success.
   Materials and methods: A retrospective study of 42 pediatric patients who were younger than 18 years and underwent a primary type 1 tympanoplasty using tragal cartilage perichondrium and temporalis fascia from January 2013 to December 2018, were evaluated. A total of 42 medical records of children aged between 8 and 18 years (20 female, 22 male) were reviewed. Age, gender, co-morbidities, perforation size and location, type (central, marginal), pre- and post-operative hearing levels, mean air-bone gap (ABG), graft material (fascia, perichondrium), length of follow up and surgical outcomes were collected.
   Results: The overall graft success rate was 83.3% (out of 35 patients). The graft success rate was significantly higher 95.2% (20/21) for the perichondrium group compared with 71.4% (15/21) for the temporal fascia group (p = 0.023). The functional success rate (postoperative air-bone gap < 20 dB) obtained in the perichondrium group was 90.4% (19/21) and 85.7% (18/21) in the fascia group, respectively. After a mean follow-up of 27.5 +/- 11.55 months, the mean hearing improvement was 11.26 +/- 7.53 dBHL for overall the group. Presence of contralateral otitis media with effusion (OME) was found a risk for reperforation and bilateral perforations were negatively affected graft success rate (p < 0.01). Graft success did not affected by age, gender and type and location of perforation (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Both temporalis fascia and tragal cartilage perichondrium are suitable graft materials for pediatric tympanoplasty with 83.3% of graft success rate. Tragal cartilage perichondrium may be the first choice of graft material due to its high success rates. There were no significant differences between the fascia and perichondrium groups in terms of functional results. Reperforation is more likely to occur in bilateral perforations and contralateral OME, and should be treated with perichondrium or cartilage graft.

AB  - Introduction: The main determinant in deciding on stapes surgery in patients with otosclerosis is the degree of hearing loss, specifically the size of the preoperative air-bone gap (ABG). The debate over the minimum ABG centers on the risk-to-benefit ratio of stapes surgery in patients with small ABG (sABG). The aim of this study was to measure the audiological outcomes and self-assessed satisfaction in a group of otosclerosis patients with an sABG who underwent stapedotomy. Methods: There were 83 patients with preoperative sABG <= 25 dB HL (mean of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 Hz) included in this study. Audiometry was performed before surgery and 6 months and 12-36 months after surgery. Self-reported patient outcomes before and after surgery were collected using questionnaires. Results: At the 6-month follow-up, the ABG was closed within 10 dB in 63 (78.8%) cases. Preoperatively, tinnitus was present in 70% of patients, of which 66% reported that tinnitus was a moderate or severe problem. Postoperatively, 71% of patients experienced a significant reduction in tinnitus severity and 34% of them reported complete disappearance. The self-report outcomes relating to quality of life and hearing reflected a good level of satisfaction in most patients. Conclusion: The possibility of reducing bothersome tinnitus after stapes surgery, and thus improving the patient's quality of life, should be taken into account when making a decision on stapes surgery in these patients.

AB  - Hypothesis:Prosthesis' length creates tension in ossicular reconstructions, which directly effects the middle ear sound transmission.Background:Relatively long prostheses are often used to stabilize the middle ear reconstruction to prevent dislocation. Thereby, tension on the flexible components such as the tympanic membrane (TM) and the annular ligament (AL) is increased. Only little is known on the amount of displacement-related stiffening of the TM and AL, as well as the consecutive reduction in middle ear transfer function (METF).Methods:An expandable total ossicular replacement prosthesis was tensionfree inserted in nine cadaveric temporal bones between the malleus handle and the stapes footplate. Upon heat activation the prosthesis was lengthened, thus inducing tension on the reconstruction. The METF was assessed before and after elongation. TM's and AL's stiffness were determined by measuring their force-displacement characteristics.Results:Upon activation the prostheses were elongated between 50 and 200 m. A frequency-dependent METF reduction was measured with a decrease of 5 to 25dB below 1.0kHz. At frequencies >2.0kHz the reduction was less prominent or the METF showed even an improvement of up to 10dB. TM's stiffness remained constant during the elongation-induced displacement, whereas the AL's stiffness increased. The METF reduction below 1.0kHz correlated with the increasing AL's stiffness.Conclusion:Tension has a significant impact on the METF after middle ear reconstruction. As little tension as possible should be used to enable best sound transmission. Stabilization of prosthesis should be achieved with dislocation devices to ensure secure coupling to the ossicular remnants without creating additional tension.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the audiological results and surgical outcomes of patients who underwent endoscopic stapes surgery (ESS).
   Methods: This study included 40 consecutive patients who underwent stapes surgery with a fully endoscopic approach at Dr. Ersin Arslan Research and Training Hospital between January, 2015 and April, 2018. We retrospectively evaluated the patients' audiological results, surgery duration, surgical findings, and complications. To assess the learning curve, participants were divided into two groups based on their date of surgery: first twenty patients (FTPs) and last twenty patients (LTPs).
   Results: The mean operative duration was 43.4 +/- 11.3 minutes among all patients, 51.5 +/- 9.2 minutes among FTPs, and 35.3 +/- 3.9 minutes among LTPs (p < 0.05). The average air-bone gap (ABG) values were 33.7 +/- 8.5 dB preoperatively and 8.7 +/- 6.9 dB postoperatively (p < 0.05). The incudostapedial joint (ISJ) of 24 patients (60%) and the stapes footplate of 13 patients (32%) were directly visible without requiring bone curettage. None of the patients experienced major complications, such as facial paralysis or sensorineural hearing loss.
   Conclusions: The present results show the surgical and audiological outcomes of exclusively endoscopic transcanal stapes surgery, indicating the advantages, limitations, and learning curve for this procedure. ESS appears to be a safe and effective alternative technique that produces reasonable surgical and functional outcomes.

AB  - Tympanic membrane perforation in children usually appears as a sequel of middle ear infection. This study was conducted to compare the anatomical and functional outcomes of cartilage and temporalis fascia graft in type 1 tympanoplasty in Paediatric population. Design: A hospital based randomized controlled trial. Setting: A tertiary care institute of central India. Subjects: All consecutive paediatric patients between 5 and 18 years of either sex attending ENT OPD and Paediatric OPD fulfilling inclusion criteria were included in the study. Anatomical and functional results of total 90 patients who underwent tympanoplasty were analyzed. These patients were divided into two groups depending on the graft material used. The cartilage group and the temporalis fascia group each comprising of 45 patients respectively. Methods: All patients underwent Type I tympanoplasty under general anaesthesia and with a post auricular approach. The surgeries were performed by senior surgeons. The graft success rate of the cartilage group (91.1%) was higher than the fascia group (84.44%) but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.449). The air bone gap closure was slightly better with temporalis fascia group than with cartilage group but the overall functional success rate in both the groups was not statistically significant.Cartilage and fascia grafts yield similar results for hearing gain and graft success rate in paediatric tympanoplasty.

AB  - Objectives: Many factors may influence the surgical outcome of tympanoplasty in children, including age, the size and location of perforation, otorrhea, status of contralateral ear, surgical technique, and adenoid hypertrophy. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of pediatric cartilage tympanoplasty and to assess the factors that affect the success of tympanoplasty in children.
   Methods: Children with chronic otitis media who underwent tympanoplasty using cartilage as graft material were evaluated retrospectively. Patient age, gender, size and site of the perforation, status of the contralateral ear, preoperative and postoperative hearing levels, surgical technique, and postoperative complications were noted.
   Results: Of the 72 patients included in the study, 27 were male and 35 were female. The average age was 13.22 +/- 2.64 and mean follow-up time was 18.4 +/- 8.62 months. Anatomic and functional success rates were 88.8% and 80.6%, respectively. Age, gender, and the status of the contralateral ear had no effect on surgical success rate. The mean preoperative and postoperative pure-tone averages were 33.2 6 +/- 10.37 and 21.00 +/- 13.25 dB, respectively.
   Conclusion: Anatomic and functional outcomes of cartilage tympanoplasty are quite satisfactory in pediatric patients. Chronic otitis media should be treated surgically as early as when patient cooperation is possible.

AB  - Purpose To assess the anatomical and functional outcomes of endoscopic transcanal tympanoplasty type I for tympanic membrane perforations.
   Methods Eight hundred thirty-five patients who underwent tympanoplasty between January 2011 and January 2019 were selected. Patients with tympanic membrane perforation treated with a transcanal endoscopic tympanoplasty type 1 and a follow-up period longer than 6 months have been retrospectively reviewed. The presence of cholesteatoma or ossicular chain dysfunctions were considered exclusion criteria. Eighty-one patients were included in the present study population. The main outcome was the rate of overall graft success. Secondary outcomes included hearing results. Prognostic factors related to both the abovementioned outcomes were assessed.
   Results Overall, 66 patients (81.5%) had a successful graft at the last follow-up evaluation. Mean follow-up was 22.1 (range 6-104) months. The anterior quadrants were entailed by the perforation in 62 (76.5%) cases. The overall success rate with cartilage (or cartilage and perichondrium) was 91.2% (p < 0.01). The median preoperative and postoperative ABG were 18.7 (13.4-25.6) and 7.5 (2.5-12.5), respectively, revealing a significant median improvement of 11.2 (p < 0.001). The type of graft and the postoperative tympanic membrane status were significantly associated with the audiologic outcome with p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively.
   Conclusions Endoscopic tympanoplasty type I is a reliable technique with reasonable anatomic and audiologic results. Tympanic membrane grafting with cartilage (or cartilage and perichondrium) guarantees a higher rate of perforation closure and satisfactory hearing results. Anterior eardrum perforations can be successfully and safely managed with transcanal endoscopic approach avoiding postauricular approach and canalplasty.

AB  - Introduction: In the last decade, there has been an increasing use of cartilage grafts in the primary repair of tympanic membrane perforations. The major advantages of cartilage are its stiffness and its very low metabolic requirements, which make it particularly suitable for difficult conditions, such as subtotal perforations, adhesive otitis and reoperation.
   Objective: To analyze the impact of different perforation sizes requiring different sizes of cartilage on the anatomical and functional outcome after tympanoplasty.
   Methods: Through this prospective non-controlled, non-randomized study, 50 patients underwent cartilage type 1 tympanoplasty (20 females and 30 males), with a mean age of 19.3 +/- 9.8 years. According to size of perforation, patients were subdivided into three groups, Group I had perforation >50% of tympanic membrane area, in Group II patients the perforations were 25-50% of tympanic membrane area, and in Group III the perforations were <= 25% of tympanic membrane. All patients had pre and postoperative Pure Tone Average and Air Bone Gap frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4 kHz). All patients were followed up at least 12 months after operation.
   Results: The anatomical success rate among all patients was 92%, all groups showed statistical significant improvement between pre and postoperative air bone gap, no significant correlation between size of cartilage graft and degree of air bone gap improvement was noticed among the three groups.
   Conclusion: Size of a cartilage graft has no impact on degree of hearing improvement or anatomical success rate after tympanoplasty. (C) 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial. Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda.

AB  - Introduction Labyrinthine fistula is one of the most frequent complications of cholesteatoma (CHO), occurring in about 8% of cases in the literature. In about 90% of cases, it is located at the level of the lateral semicircular canal, and its clinical manifestation includes vertigo, nystagmus and positive Hennebert and Tullio signs. The management of lateral semicircular canal fistula (LSCF) secondary to CHO classically requires a retroauricular access by performing a canal wall-up (CWU) or canal wall-down (CWD) mastoidectomy. However, in case of a CHO confined to the tympanic cavity causing a LSCF on the ampullar arm, a transcanal exclusive endoscopic approach could be considered. Aims The aim of this study is to describe the feasibility of a transcanal exclusive endoscopic approach in the management of a CHO confined to the tympanic cavity causing a LSCF on the ampullar arm. Methods From January 2019 to December 2020, three patients with LSCF secondary to mesotympanic CHO underwent transcanal exclusive endoscopic ear surgery repair at the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospital of Modena, Italy. Results This technique was successfully employed to treat LSCF in all three cases and was planned as a two-stage surgery, performing ossiculoplasty after 12-18 months. Functional outcomes were also satisfactory: complete eradication of CHO, hearing preservation and complete resolution of symptoms. Conclusions In case of a CHO confined to the tympanic cavity causing an LSCF on the ampullar arm, a transcanal exclusive endoscopic approach could be considered as a feasible and safe technique.

AB  - Purpose Radiological assessment of osseointegration of mastoid grafts: biological hydroxyapatite (Bio-Oss (R)) (BHA) versus bioglass S53P4 (Bonalive (R)) (BG). Methods Retrospective (10 +/- 4 months post-surgery) monocentric high resolution computed tomography (CT) scan assessment (November 2018 and October 2020) by two independent radiologists (R1, R2), blinded to patient allocation. All patients who had undergone a total mastoid obliteration were eligible. Excluded: complications namely otological acute or chronic infections, unbalanced metabolic disease, long-term cortico-steroid therapy, auto-immune disease, history of allergy to grafting materials and post-surgery CT scan in other centers (n = 8). Primary outcomes: the ratio between two regions of interests (ROI) (graft to otic capsule). Secondary outcomes: resorption of mastoid grafts and assessment of clinical tolerance. Results Included 21 patients (mean age: 29 +/- 21 years; 5 females, 16 males). Significantly higher osseointegration for BHA vs. BG (R1 p = 0.043; R2 p = 0.004); almost perfect inter-reader agreement k = 0.922). The ROI ratios for BHA and BG to that of the otic capsule were 0.57 +/- 0.11 (R1) and 0.59 +/- 0.14 (R2); 0.43 +/- 0.11 (R1) and 0.43 +/- 0.08 (R2), respectively. Density increased significantly by 399 +/- 261 Hounsfield units (HU) (p = 0.008) and decreased by 464 +/- 161 HU (p < 0.001) for BHA vs. BG. Resorption rates were 24.1 +/- 21.0% and 66.7 +/- 15.1% (p = 0.076), respectively. No significant difference in clinical tolerance was observed. Conclusion Post-operative CT scan of mastoid obliteration seems reliable in assessment of biomaterial graft's mid-term feasibility and stability: BHA seems to provide a more optimal osseointegration versus BG with no significant differences in graft resorption and clinical tolerance.

AB  - We report our experience with island cartilage tympanoplasty in revision cases and assess the anatomical and functional outcomes. We conducted a retrospective chart review at a tertiary referral center for patients who underwent revision tympanoplasty using cartilage with the island technique without mastoidectomy between January 2002 and December 2008. 60 cases were included in the study and successful closure without reperforation was obtained in 52 of 60 patients (87%). Three failed cases underwent a subsequent procedure endaurally with a positive result (92% accumulated success rate). Average postoperative pure-tone audiometry air-bone gap was 13 +/- A 7 dB compared with 21 +/- A 11 dB preoperatively (p = 0.004). An overall postoperative air-bone gap of 20 dB or less was achieved in 46 of the 60 patients (76.7%). Tympanoplasty with island cartilage grafting is a reliable procedure for revision cases with excellent anatomic results as well as significant improvement of hearing.

AB  - Background: Single-stage endoscopic tympanoplasty with septoplasty using autologous septal cartilage graft in patients with mucosal chronic otitis media and deviated nasal septum had resulted in successful repair of the tympanic membrane perforation and correction of the deviated nasal septum with improved eustachian tube dysfunction at the same time. Aims and Objectives: To study the structural and functional outcome of single-stage endoscopic Type 1 tympanoplasty using autologous septal cartilage graft after septoplasty in patients having mucosal chronic otitis media and deviated nasal septum. Material and Methods: We prospectively analysed 102 patients with chronic mucosal otitis media and central perforation of the tympanic membrane and deviated nasal septum with Eustachian tube dysfunction. The patients underwent endoscopic Type I tympanoplasty using an autologous septal cartilage graft with a thickness of approximately 0.5 mm that was harvested during endoscopic septoplasty. Morphological and functional results were recorded at 1, 6 and 12 month follow ups. Result: All patients were between years of age 31 to 40 years (31%). The average age of the study subject was 33.38 +/- 12.63 years, with the male to female ratio of 1.31. Postoperatively the patients were looked for the acceptance of the cartilage graft and hearing gain. Of the total 102 patients, in 90 patients, eardrums perforations were closed satisfactorily, and 12 patients suffered from residual perforation (12%). On the functional front the mean pre-operative hearing loss of 40.98 +/- 8.71 dB, improved significantly to 32 +/- 9.06 dB postoperatively (P-value < 0.001). with a mean gain of 8.98 dB. Also, the mean pre-operative Air-Bone gap (27 +/- 9.13 dB) was reduced postoperatively (13.82 +/- 8.45 dB) (P-value < 0.001). Thus, improvement was noted to be 13.18 dB. Conclusion: Endoscopic cartilage tympanoplasty with autologous septal cartilage graft of the nose is a safe and effective way for Type I tympanoplasty with good structural and functional results and added benefits of reduced operating time, optimal graft uptake rate, minimal morbidity and pain and more importantly, ear surgery without a postauricular scar.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: To evaluate the influence of the diameter of stapes prosthesis on functional outcomes in stapes surgery.
   Study Design: Prospective cohort study.
   Methods: Fifty consecutive small fenestra stapedotomies performed using a 0.4-mm-diameter prosthesis were compared with 50 consecutive small fenestra stapedotomies carried out using a 0.6-mm-diameter piston. Audiological assessment following the recommendations of the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium was performed 1 month after surgery. Postoperative complications between the two groups were noted.
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences in demographic data between the two groups, and no differences in preoperative bone-conduction (BC) or air-conduction (AC) hearing thresholds for all frequencies (analysis of variance [ANOVA] and chi(2) tests). No differences were found in the mean preoperative BC and AC pure-tone average and air-bone gap (ABG). In the postoperative evaluation, a statistically significant difference was found for the mean AC gain (20 +/- 8.7 vs. 24 +/- 11.5, P = .042, ANOVA) as well as for the postoperative AC threshold at 0.125 and 0.25 kHz and the postoperative BC threshold at 0.25 kHz (P < .01, ANOVA). A postoperative ABG <= 10 dB was obtained in 90% and 94% of patients in the 0.4-mm- and 0.6-mm-diameter piston groups, respectively (difference not significant, chi(2) test). No postoperative dead ear and/or sensorineural hearing loss was noted in either group.
   Conclusions: The 0.6-mm piston allowed a statistically significant higher AC gain compared with the 0.4-mm diameter piston. A larger diameter piston may be preferable if there are no anatomical or technical reasons that would favor a smaller prosthesis.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to establish the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and assess the responsiveness of the Chinese version of Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21-Chn). Study design: Prospective multicenter study. Setting: Four Chinese tertiary referral centers admitting patients nationwide. Patients: 230 adult patients with chronic otitis media (COM) undergoing tympanoplasty. Intervention: Patients were required to complete the ZCMEI-21-Chn to measure health-related quality of life both preoperatively and postoperatively. An anchor-based method was used to determine the MCID of the derivative cohort by including the Global Rating of Change Questionnaire as an anchor. The generalizability and consistency with functional outcomes of the MCID estimates were externally examined in a validation cohort using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Results: A total of 161 and 69 patients were included in the derivative and validation cohort. The mean preoperative and postoperative ZCMEI-21-Chn total scores were 28.4 (standard deviation [SD] 14.5) and 17.5 (SD 12.6). The mean change in ZCMEI-21-Chn score was 10.9 (SD 14.3, p < 0.001). The MCIDs of the ZCMEI-21-Chn for improvement and deterioration were estimated at 13 (SD 13.0) and -7 (SD 12.9), accordingly. For patients who have reported an improved health-related quality of life, a cutoff value of 15.6 dB HL for elevation of the air-conducted hearing threshold was noticed. However, change of clinical importance judged according to MCID and Japan Otological Society criteria disagreed with each other, notably with a Cohen's kappa ( kappa ) of 0.14 ( p = 0.21) in the validation cohort. Conclusion: This study is the first to establish the MCID of a COM-specific questionnaire in Chinese. For the COM population undergoing surgical intervention, MCID values of 13 for improvement and -7 for deterioration are recommended. The results were externally validated to be generalizable to nationwide usage, yet distinguishable from the audiological criteria. The availability of the MCID greatly adds to the clinical utility of the ZCMEI-21-Chn by enabling a clinically meaningful interpretation of its score changes.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional outcomes of ossiculoplasties. We conducted a retrospective study, in the department of ear, nose and throat (ENT) and congestive cardiac failure (CCF) at the University Hospital Mohammed VI, in Oujda, from October 2018 to March 2020. Out of 45 patients with secondary otitis, 30 had gone ossiculoplasty using endoscopic transmeatal approach. These patients were enrolled in the study. The average age of patients was 31.8 years, with a F/M sex ratio of 1.5. The examination of the eardrum showed type A otitis (18 cases) type B otitis (5 cases), type C otitis (3 cases) and type D otitis (4 cases), according to Austin classification; 70% of patients who had undergone surgery had hearing loss between 30 and 40 dB and 30% of patients had hearing loss of >= 40 dB. Type II ossiculoplasty was performed in 26 cases, using tragal cartilage in 18 cases. Autologous incus interposition graft and placement of titanium PORP were performed in 4 cases each, whereas ossiculoplasty type III was performed in 4 cases, with placement of titanium TORP. Type II ossiculoplasty group had a hearing gain of >= 20 dB (all cases), whereas type III ossiculoplasty group had a hearing gain of >= 1 dB (1 case). Success rate was 90%. The analysis of these results shows that the overall outcome is slightly worse in patients undergoing type III ossiculoplasty than in those undergoing type II ossiculoplasty. However, comparative studies between the placement of prostheses and autografts or between different types of materials have only shown minor differences reported by the same author or the same equipe. Many authors highlighted that the preservation of the handle of malleus could provide better functional results.

The patients were assigned to two groups according to the type of the graft used. The patients were assigned to either the tragal cartilage perichondrium group (Group A) or the fascia of the temporal muscle (Group B). The groups were compared according to the pre- and postoperative air-bone gaps and to the status of the tympanic membrane.ResultsThere were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of the age, gender, localization, MERI scores, the duration of the operation, and the size of the perforation (all p values>0.05). The pre-operative air-bone gap values of Group A and B did not show a statistically significant difference (p=0.073). The postoperative improvement in the air-bone gap value did not demonstrate a significant difference between Group A and B (p=0.202). The graft retention rates were 94.9 and 97.2% in Group A and in Group B respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of the graft retention success rates (p=0.743).Conclusion Perichondrium and fascia were suitable for use in endoscopic tympanoplasties.

This medical record includes the data of 98 patients who underwent 100 transcanal endoscopic type I tympanoplasties from November 2014 to October 2017.Setting:Tertiary referral center University Hospital of Verona, Italy.Patients:Were enrolled 109 patients, that underwent endoscopic type I tympanoplasty in the period considered. Out of the selected patients, 11 (10.1%) were lost to long-term follow-up, and were therefore excluded from our study. Other exclusion criteria were surgical approaches that included other procedures. Patients whose follow-up was shorter than 6 months were excluded from this study.Intervention:The technique is based on an endoscopic placement of underlay graft of temporal fascia or tragal cartilage. We consider the data of four surgeons from Verona University ENT department.Main Outcome Measure:In the study we considered the reduction of the Air Bone Gap as functional outcome and the integrity of the reconstruction as anatomical outcome of success.Results:No major intraoperative complications were observed. The closure rate was 86%. The mean surgery time was 48.6 minutes. The air bone gap was improved within 20 DB HL in 89% of patient. Only 8% of patients needed revision surgery, and none needed a third surgical evaluation.Conclusion:Endoscopic ear surgery is by now a reality that has replaced in many cases exclusive microscopic ear surgery. Transcanal endoscopic type I tympanoplasty can be considered nowadays as an alternative technique for tympanic membrane perforations.

AB  - ObjectivesTo compare the anatomical and functional outcomes of two different grafts which are used for the reconstruction of subtotal or total tympanic membrane perforations: the wheel-shaped composite cartilage graft (WsCCG) and temporalis fascia (TF).MethodsNinety patients (94 ears) who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty for non-complicated chronic otitis media between March 2014 and June 2016 in a tertiary referral center were included in a randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial. Tympanic membranes were reconstructed with the WsCCG or TF.ResultsOutcomes of 91 surgeries performed on 87 adults (>18years of age) were evaluated in the study. Forty-three patients (44 ears) were included in the WsCCG group; 44 patients (47 ears) were included in the TF group. The mean post-operative follow-up was 14.9months for the WsCCG group and 15.1months for the TF group. There was no statistically significant difference in post-operative pure tone average (PTA) (p=0.19), air-bone gap (ABG) (p=0.64), PTA gain (p=0.82) and ABG closure (p=0.89) values between two groups. Graft success rates at 6months after surgery were 82.9% (39/47) and 97.7% (43/44) for TF and WsCCG, respectively. At the first year, success rates were 85.1% (40/47) for TF and 97.7% (43/44) for WsCCG. A statistically significant difference was observed in graft success rates between two groups (p=0.039).ConclusionsBoth TF and WsCCG lead to satisfactory functional results, but the WsCCG clearly leads to superior anatomical outcomes with a graft success rate of 97.7%. The WsCCG is a suitable graft for subtotal or total tympanic membrane perforations and has the advantages of being a one-piece, flexible, composite, and physically resistant graft.

AB  - Background: Research on the factors affecting the functional outcome of tympanoplasty in chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is limited. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors of hearing outcome in CSOM patients following tympanoplasty. The multivariate logistic regression analysis is used to evaluate the influence of demographic, audiological, clinical and disease factors on the postoperative prognosis of CSOM.Methods: A total of 179 CSOM patients who received surgery between January 2016 and December 2019 were retrospectively included. The inclusion criteria are mainly based on clinical classification of otitis media and surgical classification guidelines [2012]. These patients were divided into an effective group (n=132) and a non-effective group (n=47) according to their postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) value. Multivariate analysis was performed according to the pure tone hearing results 1 week before operation and 4 weeks after operation.Results: The type of preoperative hearing impairment, middle ear cholesteatoma, ossicular chain status, tympanic perforation site, repair material, tympanum sclerosis, and surgical methods were significantly different between the effective and non-effective groups (all P<0.01). The speech reception threshold (SRT) (36.88 +/- 15.54 vs. 27.68 +/- 13.75, P<0.001) and ABG (18.53 +/- 9.30 vs. 10.89 +/- 5.07, P<0.001) values were markedly reduced after surgery in the effective group but not in the non-effective group. Furthermore, the postoperative decreases in the SRT (9.20 +/- 9.69 vs. 2.021 +/- 7.34, P<0.001) and ABG (7.64 +/- 8.57 vs. 0.45 +/- 7.322, P<0.00 1) values were considerably higher in the effective group than the non-effective group. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that the type of preoperative hearing impairment [P=0.031; odds ratio (OR) =2.378], ossicular chain status (P=0.002; OR =4.430).Conclusions: Our research shows that the curative effect of conductive deafness before operation is 2.378 times better than that of mixed deafness, the curative effect of complete and unfixed ossicular chain before operation is 1.080 times better than that of interrupted ossicular chain, and the curative effect of complete ossicular chain but fixed ossicular chain is 4.430 times better than that of interrupted ossicular chain. Our findings may help to predict the postoperative prognosis of patients, thus facilitating the development of corresponding treatment strategies.

AB  - Background: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of cholesteatoma of the middle ear, focusing on its clinical presentation, diagnostic imaging, and treatment outcomes. Cholesteatomas are defined by the keratinized squamous epithelium within the middle ear, leading to significant bone erosion, often affecting the ossicular chain and surrounding structures. Methods: The study explores various mechanisms involved in cholesteatoma progression, including enzymatic lysis, inflammatory responses, and neurotrophic disturbances. The study conducted a retrospective clinical and statistical review of 580 patients over a 20-year period (2003-2023), highlighting the role of advanced imaging, including computed tomography (CT) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), in preoperative planning and postoperative follow-up. Results: Findings revealed that early detection and intervention are crucial in preventing severe complications such as intracranial infection and hearing loss. Surgical treatment primarily involved tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy, with a recurrence rate of 1.55% within two years. The study underscores the importance of integrating imaging advancements into clinical decision-making to enhance patient outcomes and suggests further investigation into molecular mechanisms underlying cholesteatoma progression and recurrence. Histopathological and microbiological analysis was performed to identify pathological patterns and microbial agents. Conclusions: The study highlights the importance of early diagnosis and intervention to prevent complications such as intracranial infections and permanent hearing loss, while also emphasizing the role of advanced imaging techniques in the management and long-term monitoring of cholesteatoma patients.

AB  - Background: In children, the success of myringoplasty with temporalis fascia is lower compared to adults and cartilage as an alternative graft material has shown higher success rate.
   Objective: To compare results of myringoplasty using tragal cartilage palisades with the use of temporalis fascia in children with large tympanic membrane perforations.
   Materials and methods: This is a prospective and randomized study conducted in children of age 6-14 years with large tympanic membrane perforation of more than two quadrants. Status of graft at or around 6 weeks after surgery was used as morphological outcome measure. Pre- and postoperative audiograms were compared to evaluate audiological outcome in two groups.
   Results: Forty seven out of 55 patients completed follow-up. The graft uptake rate in the cartilage palisades and temporalis fascia myringoplasty group was 91.3% (21/23) and 83.33% (20/24), respectively; the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.666). The mean preoperative airbone gaps (ABG) in cartilage palisades and temporalis fascia group were 36.2 +/- 8.9 dB and 33.8 +/- 7.5 dB, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.412). Similarly, the postoperative ABG in cartilage palisades and temporalis fascia group were 25.1 +/- 12.2 dB and 17.2 +/- 9.2 dB, respectively, the difference was statistically significant (P = 0.040). The gap closure was 11.0 dB in palisades group and 16.8 dB in fascia group, but it was not significant (P = 0.133).
   Conclusion: In our study of pediatric myringoplasty, the morphological and functional outcomes in both cartilage palisades and temporalis fascia groups were comparable. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To compare the anatomic and functional outcomes of the cartilage and temporalis fascia graft materials in type 1 tympanoplasty in paediatric and adolescent population. A total of 55 patients aged <18 years who required type 1 tympanoplasty were selected. 30 patients underwent cartilage palisade tympanoplasty and 25 using temporalis fascia grafts. The age, the side of the operated ear, the operative technique, pre- and post operative pure tone and impedance audiological results, and the status of the graft were noted. Graft was considered taken up if there was successful closure of tympanic membrane perforation. At the end of 6 months, the graft take rate for cartilage was 90% and for temporalis fascia it was 80% (p > 0.05). ABG closure ratio in cartilage group was 58.54 +/- 23.10% and in temporalis fascia group was 56.46 +/- 27.4% (p > 0.05). Pre operatively all patients had type B tympanogram in both the groups. While post operatively either type A or C curve was seen in 80% patients of cartilage and 68% patients of temporalis fascia group. Hearing outcomes and graft success rates were high in both fascia and cartilage graft groups but not significantly different.

AB  - Treatment of cholesteatoma is surgical and has historically encompassed two main techniques: canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) tympanoplasty. Follow-up for cholesteatoma is still debated and can be either radiological or with second-look surgery. MRI with diffusion weighted sequences has proved to have high sensitivity and specificity in detecting recurrent or residual disease. Specifically, non-echo planar imaging DWI (non-EPI DWI) has been shown to be superior to other imaging techniques, allowing, in some cases, to avoid second-look surgery. Both residual and recurrence rates are higher in CWU compared to CWD procedures. Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) has become popular with the advantage of "looking around corners". The endoscope is used in addition to a microscope or exclusively to reduce cholesteatoma recurrence. In addition, it has been demonstrated that mastoid obliteration and the use of potassium titanyl phosphate laser (KTP) can reduce cholesteatoma recurrence, with better functional outcomes. A synthetic sulphur compound (MESNA) may have an interesting role in the overall improvement in recurrence and residual cholesteatoma disease. This narrative review critically appraises the factors associated with the risk of recurrent cholesteatoma.

AB  - Objective: This retrospective, comparative study aimed to assess anatomical and functional results in a group of adults undergoing type I tympanoplasty for subtotal tympanic membrane perforation, using two different types of graft.
   Subjects and methods: The study included 106 patients affected by chronic otitis media, who underwent underlay type I tympanoplasty, 53 using an autologous chondro-perichondral tragal graft and 53 using temporalis fascia. Anatomical and functional outcomes were evaluated over time.
   Results: Audiometric results comparing the cartilage and fascia groups at six months and one year after surgery showed no statistically significant differences. Assessment of anatomical outcomes indicated a greater number of complications in the fascia group.
   Conclusion: Functional results indicate the validity of the cartilage tympanoplasty, while anatomical results indicate a slightly better outcome in terms of graft re-perforation and retraction, compared with temporalis fascia at one-year follow up. These results suggest that the cartilage technique is preferable for type I tympanoplasty.

AB  - The aim of this study is to analyse the long-term anatomical and functional outcomes and prognostic factors of the canal wall down (CWD) tympanoplasty for the treatment of tympano-mastoid cholesteatoma. A total of 895 patients treated for tympano-mastoid cholesteatoma with follow-up longer than 10 years were included. Recidivism (recurrent and residual) cholesteatoma rates and functional results were analysed. The rate of recidivism was 7.7% (6.7% persistence and 1% recurrent disease). Recidivism was higher in paediatric patients (10.1% versus 5.0% of adults). Pathological middle ear mucosa and pars tensa was associated with increased rates of recidivism. Postoperatively, air pure-tone-average (aPTA) <= 30 dB was achieved in 36.4% of patients. Of 895 patients, a revision CWD tympanoplasty for chronic otorrhoea was performed in 14 cases (1.5%) with complete recovery in all cases. Nine of those patients had a recurrence of cholesteatoma and five had cavity problems related to granulation, de-epithelisation or recurrent infection. Paediatric patients and absence of stapes superstructure were associated with the worst auditory outcomes. Six-month results were always better than long-term results. A CWD approach was demonstrated to be effective, achieving the goals of cholesteatoma treatment.

AB  - Purpose To compare hearing results and complication rates between two groups of patients operated on by endoscopic stapes surgery (ESS) for otosclerosis, either with CO2 fiber laser or microdrill. Methods A case-control study was performed. All consecutive cases of CO2 fiber laser ESS operated at a single center during the period 2017-2020 (case group) were matched to a control group of patients operated by traditional technique, according to year of surgery, preoperative mean air-bone gap, sex and age. Audiological data from preoperative and postoperative examinations and complication rates were compared. Results 46 cases were included. Mean operative time was significantly longer in the laser cohort (65 min) than in the drill one (45 min) (p = 0.003). Similar results were found in the two groups regarding the mean postoperative BC-PTA. The high-frequency bone conduction resulted significantly higher in the laser group (p = 0.002), suggesting an overclosure effect in the laser group. Consistently, a significant improvement of the BC-PTA threshold at 2000 Hz postoperatively was found in the laser group (p = 0.034). The postoperative AC-PTA significantly improved in both groups at all frequencies (p < 0.05), except for the AC threshold at 8 kHz. Similar rates of complications were found in the two groups. Conclusion This study is the first to compare hearing results and complications between CO2 fiber laser and microdrill in ESS. Our results demonstrated similar functional outcomes between the two groups, confirming ESS as safe and effective, regardless of the technique used.

AB  - The use of "one-shot" CO2 laser technique for a primary small-fenestra stapedotomy is well established, but few papers report the long-term functional results. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 198 patients, treated for otosclerosis from January 2008 to December 2011, at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Catholic University of Rome. Statistical comparison between audiological thresholds obtained 24 h preoperatively, at early (4 weeks) and late postoperative examinations (mean time 45 months), was performed. Comparison of preoperative vs both early and late postoperative ACPTA showed a statistically significant difference (respectively 55 vs 33 and 31 dB; p < 0.001). No statistical difference was observed between preoperative, early and late postoperative BCPTA (respectively 23 vs 23 and 22 dB; p > 0.05). Both early and late postoperative ABG improved significantly compared to the preoperative one (respectively 10 and 9 vs 32 dB; p < 0.001). No statistical difference was found in comparison of early vs late postoperative ACPTA (respectively 33 vs 31 dB; p > 0.05), early vs late postoperative ABG (respectively 10 vs 9 dB; p > 0.05) and early vs late ABG gain (respectively 22 vs 23 dB; p > 0.05). No subjects developed postoperative complications requiring revision surgery or late deterioration of hearing threshold. The analysis of our data suggests that "one-shot" CO2 laser stapedotomy is an effective and safe procedure: it allows a rapid stapedotomy without damages for the inner ear and optimal functional results that remain stable during the years.

AB  - BackgroundChronic suppurative Otitis Media is a common ear infection in India. Canaloplasty done with tympanoplasty helps to remove bony overhangs and provide complete visibility of fibrous annulus of tympanic membrane.Aim1. To determine the hearing outcome in chronic otitis media (mucosal type) patients undergoing type 1 tympanoplasty with canaloplasty. 2. To determine the hearing outcome in chronic otitis media (mucosal type) patients undergoing type 1 tympanoplasty without canaloplasty. 3. To compare the hearing outcome in the above mentioned 2 groups of patients.Materials and Methods56 patients of 15-60 years of age with mucosal type of Chronic otitis media, with central dry perforation and intact ossicles were included in our study. They were divided into group 1 (type 1 tympanoplasty + canaloplasty) and group 2 (type 1 tympanoplasty without canaloplasty), on alternate basis. AC, BC, Air bone gap avg was assessed via pure tone audiometry at 4 frequencies preoperatively and postoperatively at 3rd and 6th month, % closure of ABG average was calculated.ResultsType 1 tympanoplasty along with canaloplasty has better hearing improvement in pure tone audiometry compared to type 1 tympanoplasty alone, as % closure of ABG at postoperative 3rd and 6th month holds significant.ConclusionThe canaloplasty provides better surgical exposure via removing bony overhangs, aids in excellent functional outcome in the form of % closure of ABG. Hence canaloplasty is added as an adjunct to routinely performed aural surgeries to enhance hearing outcome.

AB  - Many techniques and graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane. We conducted a retrospective study to compare anatomic and functional outcomes of type 1 tympanoplasty that we performed with boomerang-shaped chondroperichordrial cartilage grafts (BSGs) and shield-shaped chondroperichondrial cartilage grafts (SSGs) in pediatric patients. Our study population was made up 121 patients -61 boys and 60 girls, aged 7 to 16 years (mean: 12.4)-who had undergone a type 1 tympanoplasty. Patients were divided into two groups according to the grafting technique used; there were 59 patients in the BSG group and 62 patients in the SSG group. Ear examinations were performed at postoperative months 3, 6, 12, and 24, and pure-tone average (PTA) for air-conduction threshold values and air-bone gaps (ABGs) were evaluated at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz at the same visits. We also investigated the impact of the graft material on functional graft success and intergroup differences (if any) in surgical success. Mean postoperative follow-up periods were 30.5 and 30.2 months in the BSG and SSG groups, respectively. We found that the success rates for tympanic membrane reconstruction were not significantly different in the two groups (91.5 and 88.7%). Postoperatively, the mean PTA and ABG values in both groups at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were significantly lower than the preoperative values (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in mean PTA values between the two groups at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. However, the extent of the decrease in PTA values in the BSG group at 3 months was significantly greater than that of the SSG group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in mean ABG values between the two groups at 3, 6, and 12 months, but at 24 months, the value was significantly higher in the BSG group (p < 0.05). Finally, the extent of the decrease in ABG in the BSG group at both 3 and 6 months was significantly greater than that of the SSG group (p < 0.05). We conclude that the BSG procedure is a reliable and safe method of performing pediatric tympanoplasty.

AB  - Objective: To analyze predictive factors of outcome after ossiculoplasty using a standard ossicular prosthesis system.
   Study Design: Retrospective review of 140 ossiculoplasties, performed by the same senior surgeon, with titanium prostheses.
   Settings: Academic hospital and tertiary referral center.
   Patients: All patients undergoing ossiculoplasty with Spiggle and Theis or Kurz titanium total and partial prostheses. Documented, postoperative follow-up had to be provided. A total of 129 patients (140 ears; 53 men and 76 women) were evaluated.
   Interventions: These included ossiculoplasties using 75 Spiggle and Theis prostheses (30 partial and 45 total) and 65 Kurz prostheses (35 partial and 30 total).
   Main Outcome Measures: Mean preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps and the changes in mean hearing loss were analyzed using a four-frequency (500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 Hz) pure tone average. Success rate was defined as postoperative air-bone gap within 20 dB. A one-way analysis of variance was used to analyze group differences. A multivariate statistical analysis was then undertaken to define the significant factors.
   Results: There were no statistical difference between the Spiggle and Theis and the Kurz prostheses. Multivariate statistical analysis has identified the predictive value of the presence or absence of the malleus handle and the mucosal status of the middle ear in the prognosis of ossiculoplasties.
   Conclusion: Anatomical and technical factors diversely affect the functional outcome of tympano-ossiculoplasties. A better knowledge of their predictive value will enable accurate, preoperative, individual assessment when counseling patients with regard to the success of any proposed intervention. The use of these factors will also permit precise matching of future series to allow accurate comparisons.

AB  - Various techniques and materials have been proposed to deal with the problems that concern radical cavities. such as recurrence of the inflammatory process, the need for regular medication, and social inconvenience (eg, inability, to practice water sports, working in an adverse enviroment). This article provides a detailed report of the results of revalidation of old radical cavities using hydroxyapatite granules as a filling. The material was incorporated with fibrin adhesive to fill the mastoid cavity and was covered with a sheet of bone pate sealant. Twenty-eight patients with chronic discharging old radical cavities were selected for this study (mean follow-up 11.4 years; range 10-14 years). At the 6-month follow-up., grafting was successful in 25 patients, whereas the functional outcomes showed an air-bone gap below 30 dB in 18 patients. No postoperative sensorineural hearing loss was observed. The long-term follow-up demonstrated a slight worsening of the initial findings: four other patients had reperforation of the tympanic membrane, and hearing deteriorated in five patients to above 30 dB air-bone gap. These results could be a consequence of an alteration in the function of the eustachian tube and of the severity of the preoperative pathologic processes.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the anatomic and functional outcomes of type1 tympanoplasty with endoscopic modified butterfly cartilage-perichondrium technique. Methods: In our modification, perichondrium was elevated circumferentially till the attached part of the composite graft was approximately same size and shape of the perforation, cartilage was trimmed based on the perforation but 0.5 mm larger. Cartilage portion of the graft was placed medial to the edge of the perforation, then perichondrium was rolled out and draped on the circumferential raw surface of remaining tympanic membrane around. Results: At 4 months postop, the anatomic integrity rate of the tympanic membrane perforation for small & medium sized perforation and large sized perforation group were 100 % and 94 % (p > 0.05). For the small & medium perforation group, the mean pre and 4 months postop ACs were 30 +/- 8 dB and 18 +/- 6.4 dB (p < 0.01). The mean pre and 4 months postop ABGs were 19 +/- 11 dB and 9 +/- 3 dB (p < 0.01). For the large perforation group, the mean pre and 4 months postop ACs were 43 +/- 12.5 dB and 21.5 +/- 7 dB (p < 0.01). The mean pre and 4 months postop ABGs were 34 +/- 8.5 dB and 12.5 +/- 6 dB (p < 0.01). The differences of mean 4 months postop ACs and mean 4 months postop ABGs between the two groups were not significant (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Compared to the conventional inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty technique, large or marginal perforations can be sealed more securely by this modification.

AB  - Objective: Assess clinical and functional outcomes of a modified palisade cartilage-perichondrium graft myringoplasty under local in an office setting.
   Study design: Retrospective case series.
   Setting: Tertiary care facility.
   Patients: Patients with a tympanic membrane perforation presenting between March 2013 and October 2017. Inclusion criteria included age 7 years, entire perforation margin visualized through a transcanal view, and the ability to lie supine for up to 45 min. Exclusion criteria included a conductive hearing loss larger than expected, and presence of active infection.
   Intervention: In-office modified myringoplasty technique under local anesthesia without sedation.
   Main outcome measures: Complete perforation closure rate and audiometric outcomes.
   Results: 250 patients underwent the procedure, of whom 13 had bilateral sequential procedures (total 263 ears). Of those, 197 were primary and 66 revision. Average age was 46.3 years. Perforation sizes were categorized as small (32), moderate (109), large (78), and subtotal (44). Complete perforation closure was evident in 219 of the 250 cases (88%). Preoperative mean air pure tone average (PTA) was 56.7 dB and mean bone PTA was 27.5 dB (pre-operative ABG 29.2 dB). AC-PTA significantly improved to 35.0 dB (p < 0.0001), and ABG to 9.6 dB (p < 0.0001). Only subtotal perforations showed a statistically significant negative relationship with outcome (p = 0.04).
   Conclusion The modified palisade cartilage-perichondrium graft myringoplasty under local anesthetic is a highly successful procedure well tolerated by adult and pediatric patients with variable perforation sizes. This may have significant potential patient benefits, as well as cost savings to the health care system.

   Study Design: Retrospective case review over an observation period of 16 years (1992-2007).
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: A total of 21 patients (17 adults and 4 children) with PBCs were included, accounting for 3.4% of all cholesteatoma cases (n = 621). The average follow-up duration was 7 years (range, 2-15 yr). In all patients, a modified subtotal petrosectomy was performed with simultaneous tympanoplasty, musculoplasty, and meatoplasty in 90%. In 2 patients (10%), the cavity was obliterated. Two others (10%) needed a simultaneous temporal craniotomy.
   Main Outcome Measures: Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative findings including signs, classifications, recurrences, hearing, and facial nerve outcomes.
   Results: In the majority of patients (67%), a supralabyrinthine PBC was found. Complete macroscopic resection was achieved in all patients. During the follow-up period, 4 patients (19%) were identified as having recurrent disease. Hearing was postoperatively preserved in 14 of 17 patients with preoperative hearing (82%; 4 preoperative dead ears), of whom, 13 had functional hearing, with a mean pure-tone average of 37 dB (range, 15-55 dB). Preoperative facial nerve dysfunction completely resolved in 4 of 6 patients, and no new dysfunctions occurred postoperatively. All cavities became self-cleaning and dry.
   Conclusion: Hearing preservation was feasible in the majority of patients with PBCs. The functional surgical concept and the high number of supralabyrinthine lesions seemed to be important prerequisites for the good functional outcomes observed.

AB  - IMPORTANCE More than 500 000 children undergo tonsillectomy each year in the United States. Although prior studies suggest that most patients received perioperative antibiotics, practice varies across centers. In 2011, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) published a practice guideline recommending against perioperative antibiotic use for pediatric tonsillectomy. The impact of this recommendation has not been thoroughly examined.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the impact of the AAO-HNS guideline on the use of perioperative antibiotics and patient outcomes for pediatric tonsillectomy.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This was a quasi-experimental study including 9265 children who underwent routine tonsillectomy from January 2009 through August 2012 within a large pediatric health care network containing hospital-based and ambulatory surgical facilities. Data were collected from a shared electronic health record and validated through manual medical record review. We used an interrupted time series analysis with segmented logistic regression and a nonequivalent dependent variable (tympanoplasty) to assess acute changes and differences in trends over time relative to guideline publication.
   INTERVENTIONS Publication of the AAO-HNS clinical practice guideline.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was antibiotic administration on the day of surgery. Secondary outcomes included otolaryngology clinic encounters, emergency department encounters, hospital admissions, and surgical procedures for bleeding in the 30 days following tonsillectomy.
   RESULTS Of 9265 tonsillectomies during the study period, 5359 met inclusion criteria. Immediately after guideline publication, perioperative antibiotic use dropped by 86.5% (P < .001) and was sustained throughout the postintervention period. Rates of otolaryngology clinic encounters, emergency department encounters, and hospital admissions did not change significantly over time. There was a small but statistically significant increase in surgical procedures for bleeding following the intervention from 1.35% (95% CI, 0.57%-2.14%) to 3.48%(95% CI, 1.85%-5.10%).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE AAO-HNS guideline publication decreased perioperative antibiotic use for pediatric tonsillectomy across a large pediatric health care network. Although there were no changes in otolaryngology clinic visits, emergency department visits, or admissions, we found a small but significant increase in surgery for bleeding following guideline publication. Additional studies are necessary to verify this unexpected association.

AB  - Background The introduction of endoscopy into middle ear has open up new opportunities for minimal invasive temporal bone surgery. The present study was planned to compare anatomical and functional outcome in patients who underwent endoscope assisted tympanoplasty using cartilage and temporalis fascia graft.
   Methods The present prospective observational randomized study was carried out in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of a tertiary care teaching hospital of Rajasthan, India from September 2020 to July 2021. Fifty patients of age group 18-60 years, with diagnosis of chronic otitis media having inactive mucosal disease were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups viz. cartilage (group I) and temporalis fascia group (group II). Each patient postoperatively underwent otoscopic examination of ear and pure tone audiometery at 8 weeks and 3rd month. Local wound condition, graft uptake and healing and hearing were assessed and compared.
   Results Graft uptake was 92% in cartilage group and 84% in temporalis fascia group. Air conduction and air-bone gap of patients in both the groups showed significant improvement after 3 months of surgery. (p<0.05) Regarding bone conduction, both groups had shown non-significant changes. (p > 0.05) Hearing gain was comparable on both groups which was 6.71dB in cartilage group vs. 5.9 dB in other group.
   Conclusions The present study showed that graft placement time for temporalis fascia graft was less than cartilage graft, but the difference was insignificant. Hearing improvement, graft uptake and clinical improvement were found to be statistically insignificant between both groups.

AB  - Objective: To identify the preoperative factors that influence the success rate of type I tympanoplasty.
   Methods: A total of 247 type I tympanoplasty procedures were included in the present study. We determined the effects of the following preoperative variables on the anatomical and functional outcomes of type I tympanoplasty in order to identify prognostic preoperative factors: age (<16 years vs. >16 years), history of ear surgery, state of the contralateral ear (healthy vs. diseased), size of perforation, presence of septal pathology, presence of adenoid disease and history of smoking. Additionally, we stratified the surgical procedures according to the type of graft materials used and analyzed the effects of the above preoperative variables on the success rates of each type of procedure separately in order to eliminate the confounding effect of surgical technique.
   Results: The study was conducted on 217 subjects (130 females, 87 males) who underwent a total of 247 surgical procedures. The graft take rate was significantly higher after tympanoplasty with perichondrium-cartilage island flap (PCIF) grafts than after tympanoplasty with temporalis fascia (TF) grafts (87.8% vs. 72.3%, p = 0.008). Young age (p = 0.013), presence of adenoid hypertrophy (p = 0.001) and abnormality of the contralateral ear (p = 0.027) were associated with lower success rates after tympanoplasty with TF grafts. The success rate of tympanoplasty with PCIF grafts was not affected by any of the preoperative variables we tested. Postoperative audiometry showed that the improvement in hearing ability did not differ between patients who received TF grafts and those who received PCIF grafts (p = 0.325).
   Conclusion: Tympanoplasty with cartilage grafts was associated with better graft takes and comparable hearing outcomes than those associated with tympanoplasty with TF grafts. In patients with risk factors such as contralateral ear disease, a young age or adenoid disease, cartilage-perichondrium grafts are preferable to TF grafts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The intricacies of Endoscopic Type 1 tympanoplasty necessitate a bespoke surgical methodology, particularly in graft selection, to efficaciously address individual variances in tympanic membrane (TM) perforations. This manuscript delineates our investigative insights into the nuanced process of graft technique determination before endoscopic tympanoplasty, underscoring the pivotal role of personalized surgical strategies in optimizing patient outcomes. This study encompassed a cohort of thirty patients stratified into three groups based on a constellation of criteria: external ear canal dimensions, dermal characteristics, TM perforation location, and magnitude, alongside assessments of comorbidities and historical chronic otitis instances. These parameters were instrumental in guiding the selection of grafting modalities, including butterfly, fat, underlay tragal perichondrium, and tragal cartilage-perichondrium island techniques. Patient satisfaction was quantitatively evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and comparative analyses of preoperative versus postoperative audiometric data were performed at a six-month interval post-surgery. The application of patient-specific grafting strategies demonstrated efficacy, as evidenced by the lack of necessity for surgical revision across all cohorts. Audiometric assessments revealed no significant discrepancies in auditory enhancement across various frequencies both within and across the groups, pre- and postoperatively. The efficacy of Endoscopic Type 1 tympanoplasty is substantially contingent upon the customization of grafting techniques. This investigation corroborates the hypothesis that a comprehensive preoperative evaluation, incorporating a multitude of patient-specific factors, is imperative for identifying the optimal grafting approach. Such individualized methodologies significantly bolster surgical success rates and enhance patient satisfaction in managing chronic otitis media sequelae.

AB  - IMPORTANCE The main objective in the treatment of chronic otitis media is to relieve drainage and to rehabilitate hearing. Various materials can be used to repair the tympanic membrane (TM) through different tympanoplasty techniques.
   OBJECTIVE To assess the results of endoscopic type I tympanoplasty in pediatric patients using tragal cartilage as a grafting material.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this prospective study, we studied 80 ears in 80 pediatric patients (ages, 5-17 years) who had undergone type I tympanoplasty from January 2011 to December 2013 at a tertiary referral hospital. We classified our patients into a younger group (<= 10 years; n = 40) and an older group (> 10 years; n = 40). Patients were followed for up to 6 months.
   INTERVENTIONS Endoscopic type I tympanoplasty using split-thickness tragal cartilage.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We identified the following criteria for success: (1) healing of the TM (anatomical success) and (2) improvement in hearing by assessing the change in the air-bone gap (ABG). We also assessed the mean operation duration and the different prognostic factors. RESULTS Healing of the TM healing occurred in 34 patients (85%) in the younger group vs 36 patients (90%) in the older group. Both groups had notable improvement compared with the preoperative measurements, with no significant differences between the 2 groups. Thirty patients (75%) in the younger group had improvement in their ABG vs 32 patients (80%) in the older group, with a mean ABG of 8.0 dB and 10.5 dB in the younger and older groups, respectively. Both groups had significant functional success with no significant differences between the 2 groups. Sixty patients (75%) displayed a type A tympanogram at their 6-month postoperative audiometric testing (28 patients in the younger group vs 32 patients in the older group). There were no statistically significant differences regarding the anatomical and functional success between the patients who had previously undergone adenotonsillectomy and the other patients. The mean (SD) operation duration was 55.03 (2.50) minutes.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In pediatric patients undergoing type I tympanoplasty, the endoscopic approach using the tragal cartilage as a grafting material resulted in successful anatomical and functional outcomes that are in comparable to other techniques but with a shorter operation duration. Age of the patient, auditory tube dysfunction, and previous adenotonsillectomy were not prognostic factors for this procedure.

AB  - Background: Adhesion formation following ossiculoplasty surgery has been implicated as a cause of the progressive deterioration of an initially good postoperative hearing result. Scar tissue between the partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (PORP) and adjacent middle ear structures is a common finding at revision surgery.
   Objectives: This study aims to investigate the effects of simulated scarring on the microacoustic transmission characteristics of a PORP in the fresh cadaveric human temporal bone.
   Methods: Cortical mastoidectomy and extended posterior tympanotomy permitted access to reflective markers placed on the stapes footplate. A sound stimulus at 80 to 95 dB was presented to the closed external car canal and displacements were measured with the laser Doppler vibrometer. PORPs were placed in cadaveric specimens, and the shaft of the prosthesis was cemented to the adjacent promontory using dental cement. Serial measurements were made from the stapes footplate as the adhesive was allowed to harden, a process that we have taken to simulate the gradual fixation of the prosthesis by scarring in the live patient.
   Results: There was a consistent reduction in stapes footplate displacement as the cement hardened.
   Conclusion: The gradual adhesion of a PORP to the promontory produces a consistent reduction in microacoustic transfer to the stapes footplate in the fresh human cadaveric model.

AB  - OBJECTIVE. Because of its rigid quality, cartilage is the grafting material of choice in advanced pathologies, such as adhesive processes or recurrent perforations. However, the use of such a rigid material in tympanic membrane reconstruction causes controversies as to the audiologic aspect. The purpose of this study was to assess overall and frequency-specific hearing results after primary cartilage tympanoplasty with island technique in comparison to the hearing results after primary tympanoplasty with temporalis muscle fascia.
   STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: This study was a retrospective review of selected cases between 1999 and 2002. Primary cases with intact ossicular chain, normal middle ear mucosa, and subtotal perforation of the tympanic membrane were included in the study. Fifteen patients were in the cartilage group, whereas 10 patients were in the fascia group. Preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps at the frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were compared.
   RESULTS: Both groups were statistically similar on the aspect of the severity of middle ear pathology and the preoperative hearing levels. Mean postoperative gains in air-bone gap were 11.9 dB for the cartilage group and 11.5 dB for the fascia group. There were no statistically significant differences in the postoperative frequency-specific gains in airbone gap between the 2 groups.
   CONCLUSIONS. Although cartilage is the ideal grafting material in problem cases, its comparable acoustic properties, especially in the form of cartilage island, to those of fascia will allow a more liberal application in less severe cases, in which functional outcome is more essential.

AB  - Aim: To determine the improvement in hearing after type I Tympanoplasty in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media.
   Methods: This descriptive case series conducted in the Department of ENT, Sh. Zayed Hospital, Lahore during one year from 01-01-2019 to 31-12-2019.. Non-probability consecutive sampling technique was used.
   Results: The mean age of patients was 32.91 years (standard deviation +/- 6.22). There were 32 (49%) male patients and 33 (51%) female patients with male to female ratio 0.96:1. The mean of disease duration was 33.29 months (standard deviation +/- 26.53). There were 37 (57%) patients who had <40dB air bone gap before surgery and 28 (43%) patients had >40dB air bone gap before surgery. The mean air bone gap before surgery was 42.08 dB (+/- 6.84) and after surgery was 28.77 dB (standard deviation +/- 8.19). Most of the patients 56 (86%) had significantly improved hearing after tympanoplasty which is statistically highly significant (p <0.001) and only 9 (14%) patients had no improvement
   Conclusion: It is found in this study that with underlay technique used for type-1 tympanoplasty, good anatomical and functional outcome can be achieved with appropriate skills and experience.

AB  - Introduction Different types of autologous graft materials are used for myringoplasty, with the temporalis fascia and cartilage being the most frequently used tissues. Periosteal tissue has been used for a long time in our department, and many advantages support its use in myringoplasty. To the best of our knowledge, this issue is scarcely discussed in the previously published literature. Objective To present our experience with periosteal graft myringoplasty, describing the technique and the anatomical and functional outcomes. Methods A prospective clinical study involving 88 patients (72 females and 16 males) with a mean age 26.9 years. The patients underwent myringoplasty using the mastoid cortex periosteum; they were all operated using the postauricular approach, and the graft was applied using the underlay technique. The patients performed pre- and postoperative pure tone audiometry for tested frequencies (0.5 kHz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, and 4 kHz). All patients were followed-up for at least 12 months after the operation. Results The anatomical success rate among all patients was of 93%, which is comparable to the rate of success in procedures using other usual grafting materials. In addition, there was a highly significant postoperative improvement in pure tone audiometry results as compared with the preoperative ones (the main hearing gain was of similar to 11 dB; p < 0.001). Conclusion The periosteal graft is easily harvested, easy to apply, with excellent anatomical and functional success.

AB  - Objective: To present the preliminary results of new malleus replacement prosthesis combined with a total ossicular prosthesis in middle ear reconstruction in patients missing the malleus and stapes.
   Study Design: Prospective experimental and nonrandomized clinical study.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Methods: An original titanium malleus replacement prosthesis (MRP) was designed to be inserted into the external auditory canal and to replace a missing malleus for various middle ear pathologies. The MRP was tested experimentally and clinically. The vibratory properties of the new prosthesis were measured using laser Doppler vibrometry. Ninety patients with missing malleus and stapes, undergoing 92 ossicular reconstructions were enrolled in this study from September 1994 to March 2012. Comparative analyses were made between a group of 34 cases of ossicular reconstructions with total prosthesis (TORP) positioned from the tympanic membrane to the stapes footplate (TM-to-footplate assembly) and a group of 58 cases of ossicular reconstructions with TORP positioned from a newly designed malleus replacement prosthesis (MRP) to the stapes footplate (MRP-to-footplate assembly). Preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluation using conventional audiometry, that is, air-bone gap (ABG), bone-conduction thresholds (BC), and air-conduction thresholds (AC) were assessed.
   Results: Experimentally, the vibratory properties of the MRP are promising and remain very good even when the MRP is cemented into the bony canal wall mimicking its complete osseous-integration, if this were to occur. This finding supports the short-term clinical results as in the TM-to-footplate group; the 3-month postoperative mean ABG was 23.3 dB compared with 12.5 dB in the MRP-to-footplate group (difference, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 4.0-17.6); 37.0% of patients from the TM-to-footplate group had a postoperative ABG of 10 dB or less, and 48.1% of patients had a postoperative ABG of 20 dB or less, as compared with 58.1% and 79.1%, respectively, in the MRP-to-footplate group. The average gain in AC was 11.0 dB in the TM-to-footplate group as compared with 21.3 dB in the MRP-to-footplate group (difference, -10.3; 95% confidence interval, -18.2 to -2.4).
   Conclusion: The results of this study indicate that superior postoperative hearing thresholds could be achieved using a MRP-to-footplate assembly, compared with a TM-to-footplate assembly in patients with an absent malleus undergoing ossiculoplasty. The postoperative AC thresholds, after 3 months and 1 year, are significantly lower in patients treated with the MRP-to-footplate assembly.

AB  - Objectives: Tympanoplasty continues to pose a challenge in developing countries, where treatment cost and lack of compliance with second stage surgery are often important factors in determining the surgical strategy. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the newly developed, 'umbrella' autograft.
   Materials and methods: In 22 patients suffering chronic suppurative otitis media, in whom the incus and stapes suprastructure were found to be absent during surgery, reconstruction was achieved using cartilage-malleus umbrella graft assembly. Six-month post-operative results were evaluated on the basis of average hearing gain, measured at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz.
   Results: At six months post-operatively, 77.3 per cent of patients showed hearing improvement. Audiography at this time indicated significant improvement (p < 0.001), suggesting that this hearing gain may stand the test of time.
   Conclusion: Umbrella graft tympanoplasty appears to be a promising technique in terms of cost-effectiveness and the autologous nature of implant materials.

   To determine whether any factors are predictive of success or failure in primary ossiculoplasty employing autologous bone in Austin-Kartush Group A (stapes and malleus handle present) ears.
   Retrospective review of a single-surgeon case series.
   Two District General Hospitals in the United Kingdom.
   Of 135 patients undergoing primary repair, 116 had sufficient data for analysis (mean follow-up 33 months).
   Postoperative air-bone gaps (pABG) in patients with differing qualities of middle-ear mucosa (active versus inactive), differing pathologies (mucosal versus squamous) and differing surgical procedures [canal-wall up (CWU) versus canal-wall down (CWD)].
   'Belfast Rule of Thumb' (operated ear hearing brought to 30 dB or better or to within 15 dB of contralateral ear).
   Postoperative ABGs were closed within 10 dB in 37%, 20 dB in 74% at latest follow-up. The only significant factors predicting hearing outcomes were the status of the canal wall (CWU = 14.1 dB, CWD = 24.7 dB: significant, P = 0.00) and whether surgery was primary or revision. Mean ABG was 14.7 for inactive middle ear mucosa, 17.2 for active middle ear mucosa (not significant, P = 0.25). Excluding CWD procedures from the analysis improved outcomes to 80% (within 20 dB) and 41% (within 10 dB) overall, and the mean for active and inactive ears to 14.2 and 14.0 dB respectively. Postoperatively, 82% of patients fulfilled the 'Belfast Rule of Thumb'.
   The most significant prognostic factor affecting hearing outcomes - status of the canal wall - is independent of staging. The factor most associated with staging - the status of the middle ear mucosa - is only weakly associated with a successful functional outcome.

AB  - Objectives: The objective of this study was to present the technique of transfacial recess ossicular chain reconstruction (TFROCR) for potential use in selected patients with cholesteatoma.
   Study Design: The author conducted a retrospective case review of all candidates for TFROCR between August 1998 and March 2003.
   Setting: A tertiary referral center.
   Patients: At first-stage tympanomastoidectomy, 22 ears (21 patients; 8 children and 13 adults) with cholesteatoma and ossicular discontinuity were identified as candidates for TFROCR. Seven patients had undergone previous tympanomastoid surgery.
   Intervention: The first stage included canal wall up mastoidectomy with resection of disease, wide opening of the facial recess, cartilage graft tympanoplasty, and placement of silicone elastomer in the middle ear. Approximately 6 months later, patients underwent a second-stage postauricular procedure. Endoscopes were used to inspect the middle ear through the facial recess. When possible, TFROCR was then performed without elevating a tympanomeatal flap.
   Main Outcome Measures: Variations in anatomy, disease control, and hearing results were studied.
   Results: Of the 22 candidate ears, 17 successfully underwent TFROCR, whereas 5 required traditional second-stage procedures with canal incisions. There were no surgical complications. Early hearing results are promising with an average air-bone gap of less than 20 dB. There have been no early failures from recurrent disease or prosthesis displacement.
   Conclusions: In carefully selected patients, TFROCR could be safe and effective for disease control and hearing restoration. It could provide for optimal prosthesis placement and almost immediate hearing improvement, avoiding the need for canal incisions, middle ear packing, and dry ear precautions. One must consider the potential risk of missing residual disease secondary to limited exposure.

AB  - Tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure aiming to reconstruct the tympanic membrane and hearing. The aim of this study was to compare anatomic and audiological results of cartilage graft with temporal fascia graft in type 1 tympanoplasty patients. We conducted a descriptive, retrospective study of medical records of patients who underwent tympanoplasty between January 2010 and December 2015 at the Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery of Farhat Hached University Hospital. In total, we obtained 46 patients. Twenty-three patients who underwent type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty using cartilage graft were compared with 23 patients in whom temporal muscle fascia was used. In follow-up, residual perforation occurred in 1 of 23 patients (4.3%) undergoing cartilage tympanoplasty and in 2 of 23 patients undergoing fascia tympanoplasty (8.7%), which was found to be statistically non significant (P > 0.05). In both cartilage and fascia groups, when they were compared in terms of gain, no significant difference was found between groups (P = 0.271), air bone gap gain was found to be 12.9 +/- 9.9 decibels in cartilage group, whereas it was 10 +/- 6.6 decibels in fascia group. Operation success is defined by successful anatomical and functional outcome. Among all patients, 35 (76%) were reported to have operation success. It was established that type of operation had no significant influence on success (P = 0.73). Currently, there is an increasing interest in using cartilage grafts in primary tympanoplasty. Especially, in patients with severe middle ear pathology, cartilage graft should be used routinely without risk on influencing audiological results.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the long-term anatomical and functional results of myringoplasty in a large cohort of children and analyse factors determining outcome of surgery.Methods: A retrospective analysis of 469 cases of primary and revision pediatric myringoplasties conducted between 2003 and 2018 at the Ghent University Hospital was performed. Anatomical success was defined as an intact tympanic membrane postoperatively. Overall success was defined as an intact tympanic membrane, preservation or improvement of hearing and an ear free from otitis media with effusion, atelectasis, ear discharge and myringitis. The impact of different variables on outcome was investigated by univariate analysis.Results: In primary cases, anatomical success was achieved in 96.8% and 94.3% at early respectively late eval-uation (after 1 resp. 12 months). Overall success was achieved in 65.4% and 68.5% at early and late evaluation respectively. In revision cases, early anatomical and overall success were achieved in 96.8% and 53.8%, dropping to respectively 88.9% and 47.1% at late evaluation. In primary cases, presence of bilateral perforations was a significant predictor of a negative anatomical outcome. Further analysis of anatomical, audiological, and overall success rates in primary and revision cases could not withhold any significant predictors.Conclusion: Anatomical success rates of myringoplasty in children are high, in primary as well as revision surgery. When taking the functional status in account however, success rates are lower. The presence of a bilateral perforation predicts a worse outcome with higher anatomical failure rates. No other factors with significant predictive effect on outcome were identified.

AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the outcomes of bilateral same-day endoscopic myringoplasty using tragal cartilage from one ear in patients with bilateral chronic otitis media. In this retrospective study, medical records of 62 (84 ears) patients aged between 18 and 65 years who underwent endoscopic myringoplasty at our center between January 2015 and December 2017 were evaluated. Patients were classified into 2 groups according to surgical procedure they received: unilateral myringoplasty (group 1) and bilateral same-day myringoplasty (group 2). The comparisons were made between groups in terms of anatomical graft success and functional outcomes. There were 40 patients in the unilateral group (group 1) and 22 patients in the bilateral same-day group (group 2). The graft success rates were 92.5% and 93.2% for groups 1 and 2, respectively (P= .904). The mean preoperative air-bone gaps (ABGs) were 21.1 +/- 7.1 and 20.5 +/- 6.7 dB, respectively, whereas the mean postoperative ABGs were 8.1 +/- 2.7 dB and 7.9 +/- 3.0 dB, respectively. The difference between pre- and postoperative ABGs for the entire group was statistically significant (P< .001). Mean hearing gain was 12.5 +/- 11.0 dB and 15.6 +/- 10.1 dB in groups 1 and 2, respectively, (P= .183). Postoperative ABG was <= 10 dB in 33 (82.5%) and 36 (81.8%) ears in groups 1 and 2, respectively. The functional success rates were similar in both groups (P= .582). The average lengths of operation time were 61.6 +/- 12.5 minutes and 110.1 +/- 25.2 minutes for groups 1 and 2, respectively. Bilateral same-day endoscopic myringoplasty using tragal cartilage from one ear seems to be a safe and satisfactory procedure with a good satisfactory success rate.

AB  - Objective: Compared to canal wall up (CWU) tympanoplasty, canal wall reconstruction (CWR) allows better visualization of cholesteatoma extension. The canal wall up approach provides good functional outcomes, but with higher rates of residual cholesteatoma. The aim of this study was to compare residual cholesteatoma prevalence and location between the two approaches.
   Method: Subjects were adult patients with residual cholesteatoma following CWU or CWR surgery between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. During this period, 94 patients underwent CWU and 71 CWR; 22 presented with residual cholesteatoma: 16 after CWU (R-CWU group) and 6 after CWR (R-CWR group).
   Results: There was no significant inter-group difference in residual cholesteatoma prevalence: 17% after CWU, 8.4% after CWR. Locations comprised: 13 (81%) in the attic, 9 (56%) in the tympanic cavity and 4 (25%) in the mastoid in the R-CWU group, and 6 (100%) in the attic in the R-CWR group. There were significantly fewer tympanic cavity locations after CWR compared to CWU (P = 0.046).
   Conclusion: Residual cholesteatoma prevalence did not significantly differ between the CWU and CWR approaches. The most frequent location was the attic; significantly more locations were in the tympanic cavity with the CWU approach. These findings are important for surgeons and neuro-radiologists during follow-up. (C) 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - For several centuries silver is known for its antibacterial effects. The middle ear is an interesting new scope for silver application since chronic inflammations combined with bacterial infection cause complete destruction of the fragile ossicle chain and tympanic membrane. The resulting conductive deafness requires tympanoplasty for reconstruction. Strategies to prevent bacterial growth on middle ear prostheses are highly recommended. In this study, rabbits were implanted with Bioverit (R) II middle ear prostheses functionalized with silver containing dense and nanoporous silica films which were compared with pure silica coatings as well as silver sulfadiazine cream applied on nanoporous silica coating. The health status of animals was continuously monitored; blood was examined before and after implantation. After 21 days, the middle ears were inspected; implants and mucosal samples were processed for electron microscopy. Autopsies were performed and systemic spreading of silver was chemically analyzed exemplarily in liver and kidneys. For verification of direct cytotoxicity, NIH 3T3 cells were cultured on similar silver containing silica coatings on glass up to 3 days. In vitro a reduced viability of fibroblasts adhering directly on the samples was detected compared to cells growing on the surrounding plastic of the same culture dish. In transmission electron microscopy, phagocytosed silver silica fragments, silver sulfadiazine cream as well as silver nanoparticles were noticed inside endosomes. In vivo, clinical and post mortem examinations were inconspicuous. Chemical analyses showed no increased silver content compared to controls. Mucosal coverages on almost all prostheses were found. But reduction of granulation tissue was only obvious around silver-coated implants. Single necroses and apoptosis in the mucosa were correlated by intracellular accumulation of metallic silver. For confirming supportive healing effects of middle ear implants, silver ion aggregates need to be tested in the future to optimize biocompatibility while assuring bactericidal effects in the middle ear.

AB  - Objectives: There is a marked diversity in the reported success rates for achieving an intact tympanic membrane following tympanoplasty. Controversy exists about the factors thought to influence surgical outcome. These facts have important implications for the selection of patients who would benefit the most. This study reviews the factors thought to determine the anatomical and functional success of tympanoplasty in children.
   Materials and methods: Retrospective study of the anatomical and functional results of 91 tympanoplasties performed in children. Age, gender, size and site of perforation, status of operated and contralateral ear, underlying cause of the perforations, surgical technique, pre-operative and post-operative hearing levels, post-operative follow-up time and post-operative complications were recorded. We divided our population into two groups according to the expected eustachian tube maturity (younger group (N = 24): <= 10 years old, older group (N = 67): >10 years old). All patients were evaluated in terms of anatomical and functional outcome and complications.
   Results: Anatomical success was achieved in 85.7% and functional success was 76.9% after a mean follow-up of 25.6 +/- 17.1 months. Anatomical success (intact tympanic membrane) was achieved in 83% of younger vs 87% of older patients (p = n.s.). Functional (air bone gap closure) success was 75% in the younger group vs 78% in the older group (p = n.s.). There were no significant differences in post-operative gain at different frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz) between the two groups. A previous adenoidectomy in children older than 10 years seems to be an independent predictor of functional success The incidence of minor and major complications were 29% in patients aged <= 10 and 21% in those older than 10 (p = n.s.). We report 12.9% minor post-operative complications in successful cases: injury to the chorda tympani nerve (5.7%), wound infection (2.9%), otitis externa (2.9%) and transient vertigo (1.4%). Among the 21 reperforations observed, 92.3% occurred before 1 year.
   Conclusions: This study shows that tympanoplasty is a valid treatment modality for tympanic membrane perforation in the pediatric population. A tympanic membrane perforation can be closed at any age. There is no age limit below which perforation should not be closed. A previous adenoidectomy in children older than 10 years seems to be an independent predictor of functional success. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - ObjectiveRecommendations for air travel after stapes surgery, specifically stapes surgery, vary, with no standard recommendation to guide patients and surgeons. According to our search, no previous article has explored the physics of middle ear changes during flight and its effects on poststapedectomy patients in a systematic way. The aim of this study is to bring together 2 arms of expertise, otology, and aviation, to produce an evidence-based recommendation for flight after stapes surgery. Data SourcesThe database MEDLINE was searched during August 2022. The search strategy had the goal of identifying studies that discovered the effects of flying on stapes surgery patients and the effects of atmospheric pressure on middle ear structures. Review MethodsThe articles yielded from the search strategy were transferred to the online citation manager Rayyan. Included in the review were those studies reporting patient outcomes after flying following ear surgery; additional studies included those reporting pressure changes in the middle ear and ossicular chain displacement whether in experimental or animal conditions. ConclusionModern-day commercial air travel is safe for patients who have undergone stapedotomy surgery, even very shortly after hospital discharge if they have to. Implications for PracticeIf stapedotomy patients wish to fly after hospital discharge, otologists are to reassure them that it is safe to do so. Patients are to be reminded to perform a gentle Valsava maneuver about every 4 minutes during airplane descent.

AB  - In this manuscript, the application of hydroxyapatite coatings to total ossicular reconstruction prostheses (TORPs) using finite element modeling simulations was investigated to enhance the biocompatibility and mechanical performance of these prosthetic devices for middle ear implants. We focused on evaluating biocompatible materials, particularly polyetheretherketone (PEEK) and titanium, by analyzing their mechanical behavior under simulated conditions. The results revealed that PEEK demonstrates mechanical performance almost on par with titanium, exhibiting excellent stability and resilience within the middle ear environment. PEEK offers several key advantages over titanium, including easier fabrication, greater availability, and a simplified application process for hydroxyapatite coatings. These benefits suggest that PEEK could be a highly effective alternative to titanium for use in middle ear prostheses. The findings of this study highlight the potential of PEEK to improve the design and functionality of middle ear implants, providing a promising direction for future research and development in this field. By leveraging the advantages of PEEK, we can advance the effectiveness and accessibility of middle ear prosthetic devices, ultimately benefiting patients requiring such interventions.

AB  - Objectives: To compare partial ossicular replacement (POR) with type II tympanoplasty (T2) with regard to the postoperative hearing outcomes in patients with congenital aural atresia.
   Study Design: A retrospective review of medical records.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: Thirty-four ears undergoing POR were compared with matched 34 ears by age at operation, grade of microtia, and the Jahrsdoerfer grading scale score that underwent T2.
   Methods: The medical records of the patients that underwent surgery for congenital aural atresia were reviewed.
   Main Outcome Measures: The preoperative and postoperative air-conduction threshold, air-bone gap, and air-bone gap closure were compared between the 2 groups.
   Results: Thirty-four ears in each group were compared. PORs were performed in cases of a incudostapedial joint problem, ossicular anomaly, or ossicular fixation. The preoperative and 6-month postoperative mean air-conduction thresholds and air-bone gaps were not significantly different in the comparisons between the 2 groups. The mean values for the postoperative air-bone gap closure were not significantly different in the 2 groups. The hearing results 3 years after surgery were available in 13 patients in each group. In these patients, the mean values of the preoperative and the 3-year postoperative air-conduction threshold and air-bone gap were not statistically different in the 2 groups. However, the mean air-bone gap closure in the POR group was 28.6 +/- 10.2 dB hearing level compared with 19.0 +/- 12.9 dB hearing loss in the T2 group, which was statistically significant (p = 0.034).
   Conclusion: POR can be a good surgical option in cases of a poor incudostapedial joint connection, ossicular anomaly, or ossicular fixation.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess and quantify the current surgical practice of ossiculoplasty among British otolaryngology consultants, using a postal questionnaire. Ossiculoplasty is not a very common procedure. It is only performed by otologists with a special interest in ossiculoplasty. Among the 280 respondents (response rate 51.9 per cent), only 179 (63.9 per cent) performed ossiculoplasty. The majority of the consultants (86.5 per cent) used artificial prostheses, and 63.7 per cent used patients' own ossicles (autografts). Most of the consultants (77.6 per cent) performed ossiculoplasty with primary tympanoplasty surgery rather than with primary cholesteatoma surgery (46.3 per cent). The majority of the consultants (50.8 per cent) performed less than 10 ossiculoplasties per year. This is the first survey on ossiculoplasty surgery in the United Kingdom.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to compare the hearing outcome in patients who underwent ossiculoplasty with cartilage interposition versus those with partial ossicular replacement prosthesis.
   Methods: A total of 47 ears from 45 consecutive patients with ossicular discontinuity were enrolled in the study. Cartilage interposition was used in 27 consecutive cases (group A), and partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (group B) was performed in 20 consecutive cases. Preoperative and postoperative air conduction, bone conduction, and air-bone gap were evaluated and compared in both groups. Visual analog scale was used to give a rough indication of patients' satisfaction with their hearing after surgery.
   Results: In group A, the average preoperative air-bone gap was 32.8 dB, while the average 12-month postoperative air-bone gap was 8.2 dB. The average preoperative and 12-month postoperative air-bone gap in group B was 29.6 and 9.5 dB, respectively. The difference between the preoperative and postoperative ABG was highly significant in both groups. However, no significant difference was noted between both groups in preoperative or postoperative air conduction, bone conduction, or air-bone gap. A postoperative air-bone gap at 12 months within 20 dB was achieved in 80.8% in group A and 76.2% in group B. This difference was not statistically significant. The difference between preoperative and postoperative hearing satisfaction measured by visual analog scale was significant in both groups (P < .001). However, the postoperative satisfaction level on visual analog scale showed no statistically significant difference between both groups.
   Conclusions: Both techniques yielded similar results where there was no significant difference between these 2 groups according to hearing results.

AB  - Aim of the study was to compare the surgical outcome of endoscopic with microscopic Type 1 tympanoplasty in dry, mucosal type of chronic otitis media with respect to graft uptake rate, hearing gain and duration of surgery. This randomized controlled trial of 3 years was carried out at Tertiary Care Hospital of Central India. Total 80 cases of mucosal type of chronic otitis media posted for Type I tympanoplasty were included in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups viz. Endoscopic tympanoplasty and microscopic tympanoplasty with 40 patients in each group. Chi-square test was used to compare the qualitative results and student's t-test was used to compare quantitative results with a level of significance of p <= 0.05. Intraoperatively, widening of external auditory canal and auxiliary incision were required in 45% and 47.5% patients of microscopic group respectively. Mean operative time for endoscopic tympanoplasty (62.5 +/- 14.94 mins) was less as compared to microscopic tympanoplasty (74.88 +/- 15.83 mins). Graft uptake rate was 95% and 92.5% in endoscopic and microscopic tympanoplasty groups respectively with statistically insignificant difference (p = 0.32). The preoperative mean air bone gap in both the groups was improved significantly 6 months postoperatively. Air bone gap closure was of 13.21 +/- 4.37 dB in endoscopic group and 12.54 +/- 4.14 dB in microscopic group with statistically insignificant difference. Endoscope provides superior visualization of hidden areas of middle ear cavity and has shorter operative time than microscopic tympanoplasty with comparable surgical and functional outcomes. hence endoscopic tympanoplasty can be a good option to microscopic surgery.

AB  - Conclusions: The round window (RW) approach in the use of the Vibrant Soundbridge (R) (VSB) is a safe and effective treatment of conductive and mixed hearing losses for a period of more than 3 years of device use. Objective: To investigate the long-term safety and efficacy as well as user satisfaction of patients with conductive and mixed hearing losses implanted with the VSB using RW vibroplasty. Methods: Twelve patients with conductive and mixed hearing losses were evaluated after 40 months of daily VSB use. Safety was assessed by evaluating reports of postoperative medical and surgical complications as well as by changes in bone conduction hearing thresholds. Efficacy outcome measures included aided and unaided hearing thresholds, speech recognition in quiet and in noise and subjective benefit questionnaires. Results: The safety results revealed no significant medical complications. One subject experienced sudden hearing loss after 18-24 months of device use, but still continues to wear the device to her satisfaction. With regard to efficacy, there were no significant changes from short-to long-term results in aided word understanding, functional gain or speech recognition threshold, suggesting that the outcomes are stable over time. Subjective questionnaires revealed either the same or better results compared with the short-term data.

AB  - Objective: To raise awareness of the potential hazard of auricular burns associated with operating microscope use during otologic surgery. Study
   Design: Retrospective case series and summary of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of voluntary adverse event reports pertaining to microscope related auricular thermal injuries.
   Patients and Setting: All patients who sustained auricular burns while using the operating microscope during otologic surgery at 2 tertiary academic referral centers.
   Main Outcome Measures: Surgical procedure, microscope model, intensity of illumination, length of procedure, focal length, location and severity of burn, and patient outcome.
   Results: A total of 4 microscope-related auricular thermal injuries were identified from the authors' institutions. Additionally, 82 unique cases of soft tissue burns associated with the use of an operative microscope have been voluntarily reported to the FDA since 2004. A disproportionately large percent (similar to 30%) of these occurred within the field of otology, the majority of which were during tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy procedures at focal length distances of 300 mm or less with xenon light source microscopes.
   Conclusion: Simultaneous advancements in light delivery technologies and lens optics have continued to improve the efficiency of the operating microscope; however, these improvements also increase the potential for thermal injuries. Although rare, a review of the FDA MAUDE database suggests that microscope-related soft tissue burns occur more frequently in otology than any other surgical specialty. A variety of factors may help explain this finding, including the unique anatomy of the external ear with thin skin and limited underlying adipose tissue. Preventative measures should be taken to decrease the risk of thermal injuries including use of the lowest comfortable light intensity, adjusting the aperture width to match the operative field, frequent wound irrigation, and covering exposed portions of the pinna with a moist surgical sponge.

AB  - The authors present their combined experience with large cartilage-perichondrial composite grafts used to reconstruct total tympanic membrane perforations in 294 years.  Patients chosen for this procedure had failed earlier tympanoplasty surgery or were identified as poor candidates for conventional fascial tympanoplasty because of the perforation size.  Successful perforation closure was achieved in 97% of ears with chronic otitis media characterized by absence of the tympanic membrane, including portions of the anterior annular ligament.  Hearing results in general were good, considering the advanced stage of the disease, which required the use of alloplastic ossicular prostheses (PORP and TORP) in 76% of ears.  Hearing improvement was maximal at 2000 Hz regardless of the method of ossicular reconstruction.  Closure of the air-bone gap at this frequency to within 10 dB was achieved in 87% of type I tympanoplasties, 73% of type III (PORP), and 70% of type III (TORP) tympanoplasties.  Although cartilage autografts have also been promoted to reverse tympanic membrane atelectasis, the authors believe that the above preoperative conditions are strong indications for this grafting technique, which is described in detail.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this paper is to review how successful each type of grafts is in tympanoplasty. Methods: Pubmed, Google and the Proquest Central Database at Kirikkale University were queried using the keywords "graft", "success" "tympanoplasty", "success rate" with the search limited to the period 1955 to 2017.
   Results: Various types of graft materials including temporalis fascia, cartilage, perichondrium, periosteum, vein, fat or skin have been used in the reconstruction of tympanic membrane (TM) perforation. Although temporalis fascia ensures good hearing is restored, there are significant concerns that its dimensional stability characteristics may lead to residual perforation, especially where large TM perforations are involved. The "palisade cartilage" and "cartilage island" techniques have been stated to increase the strength and stability of a tympanic graft, but they may result in a less functional outcome in terms of restoring hearing. Smoking habits, the size and site of a perforation, the expertise level of the operating surgeon, age, gender, the status of the middle ear mucosa and the presence of myringosclerosis or tympanosclerosis are all important in determining how successful a graft is.
   Conclusion: Although temporal fascia is the most commonly used graft material for tympanoplasty, poor graft stability may cause failure. This failure is due to the inclusion of connective fibrous tissue containing irregular elastic fibers present in the grafted fascia. Cartilage grafts offer better ability to resist infection, pressure, and cope with insufficient vascular supply. This means that cartilage grafts are suitable for use in revision cases.

AB  - Autologous fibrin tissue adhesive is currently the most promising adhesive for otologic use with respect to strength and biocompatibility without the risk of transmissable disease that is of concern with the commercially prepared fibrin adhesive. We set out to evaluate the practicality of preparing autologous fibrin adhesive in cats and to see if the adhesive's duration and strength of bonding was sufficient to allow natural tissue union to occur with various grafting materials. Autologous fibrin adhesive was prepared preoperatively from ten cats using the ammonium sulfate precipitation technique. Twenty otologic procedures were performed in which the incus long process was resected and the defect bridged with one of four grafting materials: autograft ossicular bone, bone pate-fibrin glue, porous hydroxylapatite, and Plastipore-bone pate. All grafts were secured with the autologous adhesive. The cats were sacrificed at 6 and 12 weeks. We found the the autologous adhesive provided adequate duration and strength of support to enable a firm tissue union between all the grafting materials and the adjoining incus and stapes.

AB  - Objective: The functional outcome of ossiculoplasties in chronic ear and lateral cranium base surgery depends on the presence of a ventilated middle ear space and is guided by the existence or absence of ossicular remnants. In patients with poorly ventilated middle ears, after multiple previous operations, missing stapes suprastructure, or after partial temporal bone resection for tumor removal, restoration of conductive hearing is not possible. The direct placement of a vibrating floating mass transducer (FMT) onto the round window membrane with obliteration of the surgical cavity is a new option.
   Patients and Intervention: Starting in January 2006, five patients underwent a subtotal petrosectomy to control their chronically discharging ear, to remove residual cholesteatoma, or to revise previous incompletely exenterated cavities. Four patients underwent a simultaneous placement of a Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) onto the round window membrane; one patient had a staged reconstruction after initial Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid rehabilitation. In all operations, the external ear canal and the eustachian tube were closed, and the cavity was obliterated using abdominal fat.
   Main Outcome Measures: Preoperative and postoperative pure tone audiograms were analyzed in respect to deterioration of inner ear function, aided and unaided (hearing aid, VSB, and Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid) speech audiograms were compared to verify improvements in communication skills, functional gains were calculated at comfortable level settings, and postoperative computed tomographic scans were used to exclude recurrent disease and to confirm the position of the FMT onto the round window membrane. Patient's satisfaction was measured using a standardized questionnaire.
   Results: All patients were very satisfied daily users of their middle ear implant and had complete eradication of their middle ear pathology. Bone conduction worsened at 2 kHz, with preservation of inner ear function in the other frequencies. Whereas none of the patients had any unaided speech discrimination before the surgery at conversational levels, all patients obtained 95 to 100% correct monosyllabic scores at 70 to 80 dB using the VSB. The functional gain was highest at higher frequencies.
   Conclusion: Patients with combined hearing loss undergoing subtotal petrosectomy with complete fat obliteration of the middle ear and mastoid area can be safely rehabilitated, placing the FMT of a VSB onto the round window membrane, either at the time of primary surgery, or as a staged secondary procedure.

AB  - Background and Objectives: To assess the potential use of diode laser soldering to improve mechanical stability of middle ear reconstruction. The diode laser with a biological solder may offer benefits over traditional methods. We evaluated the strength of soldered bonds and a means to apply such a technique in the human middle ear.
   Study Design/Materials and Methods: The strength of soldered junctions using fascia, cartilage, bone, and hydroxyappatite was evaluated in vitro. A diode laser (810-nm wavelength) and 50% albumin with 0.1% indocyanine green dye was used. Soldered bonds were compared to those obtained with adhesive alone. A fiberoptic delivery system was evaluated. Ten hydroxyappatite prostheses were soldered to the stapes in human cadaver temporal bones, and the force required to disrupt the bonds were measured.
   Results: Statistically significant greater strength was obtained with soldering. Ossicular prostheses can be effectively secured to the stapes in a cadaver model.
   Conclusions: Soldering techniques show promise in middle ear reconstruction.

AB  - This paper describes the Mills sleeve technique of ossicular reconstruction for defects of the incus long process and reviews the results of 27 procedures. A retrospective review of operations was performed by eight otologists. The results are compared with those from three other reconstruction techniques (cortical bone graft, cortical bone sleeve and incus autograft).
   Prostheses were supplied to surgeons who expressed an interest. Pre- and post-operative audiological data forms were analysed for each case along with a questionnaire about use of the prosthesis. The mean post-operative air bone gap (ABG) was compared with results from cortical bone sleeve, incus autograft and simple cortical bone graft reconstruction cases previously performed by the senior author. Twenty-seven procedures were performed. Closure of the ABG to within 10 dB was achieved for 44.4 Per cent of Mills sleeve cases compared With 44.7 per cent for the cortical bone sleeve, 52.9 per cent for ossicular and 26.9 per cent for cortical bone grafts. The responses to a questionnaire sent to participating surgeons are discussed.
   For the current follow-up period (three months to three years) the Mills sleeve prosthesis appears to be safe and easy to use with audiological results at least as good as other reconstructive techniques,

AB  - Objectives To compare quality-of-life (QoL) measurements with audiological results after stapes surgery with two different prostheses. Methods This is a retrospective longitudinal study. All patients required stapes surgery for otosclerosis and ossicular chain reconstruction with either a titanium band prothesis (TBP) or receiving a nitinol head prosthesis (NHP). Intervention was between January 2011 and March 2017 patients received stapes-surgery with either TBP (n = 95) or NHP (n = 50). Audiological measurements at three different time points (preoperatively, early follow up < 3 months, late follow-up > 3 months) were compared and two different QoL-inventories, the Glasgow-Benefit-Inventory (GBI) and the Stapes-Plasty-Outcome-Test-25 (SPOT-25) were investigated postoperatively. The main outcome measures were Pure tone average (PTA) at 0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz at early and late follow up after stapes surgery were compared and correlated with the subjective benefit on the QoL inventories. The perforation method and the type of surgery were analyzed as potentially influencing factors. Results All patients showed a significantly reduced air bone gap (ABG 0.5, 1, 2, 3) at the two follow-up visits (visit 2: mean: 13.6 dB, SD 7.7; visit 3: mean: 12.7 dB SD 8.1) compared to preoperative measurements (mean: 28.9 dB, SD 9.9) and subjectively benefitted from stapes surgery (mean GBI score: 21.55; SD 20.60, mean SPOT-25 score: 28.03; SD 18.53). The outcome of the two questionnaires correlated with each other. Neither the hearing-outcome nor the subjective benefit was significantly influenced by the prosthesis, the perforation method or the type of anesthesia. Conclusions Both prostheses were safe and led to comparable hearing results as well as to subjective benefits in the Health-related-Quality-of-Life (HrQoL). A combination of the two questionnaires is recommendable for postoperative quality control.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate and compare the audiometric outcomes of ossicular reconstruction with titanium prosthesis and autologous material.
   Study Design. Retrospective cohort study.
   Setting. Tertiary referral center.
   Subjects and Methods. Audiometric results of consecutive patients who performed ossiculoplasty with titanium prosthesis (n = 43) or autologous material (n = 48), from October 2008 to December 2011, were reviewed retrospectively and compared. The association between air-bone gain and age, ossiculoplasty material (autologous or titanium), preoperative diagnosis (chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma, cholesteatoma, or conductive hearing loss with intact tympanic membrane), and type of surgery (tympanoplasty, canal wall-down mastoidectomy, or canal wall-up mastoidectomy) was explored using regression analysis.
   Results. Preoperative audiometric evaluation did not show differences between titanium and autologous groups in air-bone gap and pure-tone average. A postoperative decrease of 11.0 dB in air-bone gap and 12.4 dB in pure-tone average was observed in titanium ossiculoplasty compared with a reduction of 4.0 dB in air-bone gap and 5.1 dB in pure-tone average when autologous reconstruction was used. Mann-Whitney test revealed superior results in the titanium group compared with autologous reconstruction patients in air-bone gap (P = .02) and pure-tone average (P = .02). However, no statistically significant associations were observed after multivariate linear regression analysis of air-bone gap gain when adjusted for age, ossiculoplasty material, type of surgery, and preoperative diagnosis. One titanium prosthesis extrusion occurred during follow-up (2%).
   Conclusion. Audiometric results achieved by titanium prosthesis are promising, but significant differences compared with autologous ossiculoplasty were not present.

   Methods: The author's database of major otological procedures was reviewed to identify cases in which a transcanal approach was utilized to remove disease confined to the tympanum-antrum. Cases in which disease progressed into the mastoid, requiring a postauricular approach were excluded. Patient demographics, ear pathology, surgical variables, postoperative variables, and audiometric data were recorded. Standard descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and clinical characteristics of study cases. Intraoperative video segments were recorded and edited to depict the operative technique.
   Results: Transcanal antrotomy was performed on 47 patients (mean age = 38.7, 51% men, 49% women). Ossicular reconstruction was performed in 27 patients during initial surgery. Sculptured, interposed incus was used in 77.8% of cases. Average intraoperative time was 130 minutes (range = 79-166 min). No major complications occurred postoperatively. Follow-up ranged from 26 to 3,680 days (average = 922 days). No patient had recurrent disease in the antrum. Closure of air-bone gap to within 20 dB occurred in 85% of cases.
   Conclusions: Transcanal antrotomy is a safe, efficacious, and minimally-invasive approach to remove disease from the middle ear and antrum. This approach allows for optimal exposure of the antrum and is less invasive than postauricular and endaural approaches. With transcanal antrotomy, second stage procedures can be avoided in many cases resulting in reduced costs and improved quality of life.

AB  - Objectives: One reason for insufficient hearing improvement with a distinct air-bone gap after ossiculoplasty with implantation of partial or total ossicular replacement prostheses can be the dislocation or minimal shifting of the prosthesis. The aim of this study was the simulation of common clinical borderline situations with minimal shifting of the prosthesis in temporal bone specimens after ossiculoplasty. It was furthermore the goal to identify these specific situations through imaging by cone beam computed tomography (cbCT) and direct visual inspection using the operation microscope. Additionally, the functional status was evaluated using laser-Doppler vibrometry (LDV).
   Design: We used a total of four temporal bone specimens for this study. A reconstruction with a partial ossicular replacement prostheses was performed in three specimens and with a total ossicular replacement prostheses in one specimen, with good initial acoustic properties. Subsequently, one specific type of prosthesis failure was simulated in each specimen, respectively, by minimally shifting, tilting, or bending the prostheses from their initial positions. These changes were introduced step-by-step until a borderline situation just short of complete acoustic decoupling was reached. Each step was examined using both LDV and cbCT and observed through the operation microscope.
   Results: LDV was able to quantify the mechanic function of the ossicular chain after most of the manipulation steps by demonstrating the effect of any shifting of the prosthesis on the middle ear transfer function. However, in some situations, the middle ear transfer function was better with a visually more advanced failure of the prosthesis. In addition, cbCT showed most of the steps with excellent resolution and was able to delineate changes in soft tissue (e.g., cartilage covering).
   Conclusion: cbCT seems to be a promising imaging technique for middle ear problems. As cbCT and LDV exhibited slightly different advantages and disadvantages regarding the demonstration of borderline situations, the combination of both techniques allowed for a more precise evaluation of middle ear reconstructions. Knowledge of the specific characteristics of these methods and their possible combination might help otologists and otosurgeons to refine indications for revision surgery and improve their personal patient counseling.

AB  - The intricate distribution of the facial nerve within the temporal bone is crucial in otological surgery. Anomalous facial nerve pathways are occasionally observed in middle ear malformations, although intratympanic bifurcation of the facial nerve is rare. When managing ossicular malformations with atypical facial nerve trajectories, hearing reconstruction should be prioritized based on the trajectory pattern and presence of the oval window. In this case, stapes surgery was performed due to facial nerve bifurcation within the tympanic cavity. In this case report, a 15-year-old female underwent stapes surgery due to gradually worsening conductive hearing loss. She was monitored at another hospital because of left-sided hearing loss at birth screening using automated auditory brainstem response. Her left ear initially had mild hearing loss, while her right ear remained within normal limits. However, her hearing deteriorated progressively, leading to significant daily challenges by age seven, prompting referral to our hospital. Intraoperatively, findings included defects in the incus-long process and stapes head, along with facial nerve bifurcation around the oval window, and the stapes footplate had poor flexibility. Stapedotomy was performed cautiously to preserve the facial nerve, utilizing a Teflon piston wire for sound transmission reconstruction. Postoperatively, the patient experienced no complications or facial nerve palsy, with hearing improving to 28.8 dB. Understanding the precise pathophysiology of middle ear anomalies is crucial for selecting appropriate surgical approaches. Even though the anomalies could not be evaluated prior to surgery, surgeons must carefully consider the risk of facial nerve injury and choose the optimal technique and reconstruction method tailored to each case, as predicting outcomes solely from preoperative evaluations can be challenging.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate, over the long term, the anatomic and functional outcome of canal wall-down mastoidectomy performed for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and chronic otomastoiditis resistant to all conservative treatment. The study was made through a retrospective review of 338 cases of consecutive primary canal wall-down mastoidectomies performed between 1974 and 1998. Included were 259 cases with sufficient data. In all cases, functional reconstruction was performed at the same time as the mastoidectomy. Demographic and clinical data were collected from each file. From the clinical data, the surgical techniques, complications, the number of follow-up visits necessary to ensure cavity cleanliness, details of care provided over the period 1 to 24 years (mean 7 years) after the operation, and audiometric data from admission and from the latest postoperative follow-up were retained. Canal wall-down mastoidectomies were followed up an average of 10 times during the first 6 months after operation, twice a year over the 6-year period following surgery, and less than twice a year beyond the 6-year period. Care was dispensed for meatal stenosis, scars, infections, polyps, and beads of cholesteatoma. Surgical revisions were performed because of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in 6.1% of the cases, because of perforation of the tympanic membrane in 7.3% of the cases, and to improve hearing in 12.2% of the cases. At the last consultation, 1 to 24 years after surgery, cavities were found to be dry and self-cleaning in 95% of the cases, and still humid, with otorrhea, in 5% of the cases. Over the long term, the hearing threshold remained unchanged in 41.3% of the cases. It was improved after surgery by 10 to 19 dB in 15.4% of the cases, by 20 to 29 dB in 11.5% of the cases, and by more than 29 dB in 3.8% of the cases. The hearing threshold was thus improved or at least remained unchanged in 72.0% of cases. Hearing losses occurred in 28% of the cases: by 10 to 19 dB in 11.9%, by 20 to 29 dB in 6.5%, and by more than 29 dB in 9.2% of the cases. A sensorineural hearing loss of more than 60 dB at all frequencies occurred immediately after the operation in 2 cases (0.7%). There was 1 case of facial paralysis (0.3%). Four patients (1.5%) complained of persistent vertigo. Canal wall-down mastoidectomy is an adequate treatment for chronic otitis with cholesteatoma or chronic otomastoiditis. The anatomic and functional results are satisfactory, and the rate of complications is acceptably low. A tympanoplasty can be performed simultaneously. Thus, for the large majority of patients, only a single intervention is required; however, a small minority can benefit from a revision tympanoplasty. In order to obtain these results, both the patient and the surgeon should engage in a long-term follow-up.

AB  - Objective: To assess the usefulness of numeric grading scales of middle ear risk in predicting ossiculoplasty hearing outcomes. Study Design: Retrospective review. Setting: Tertiary care, academic medical center. Patients: Adults and children undergoing ossiculoplasty between May 2013 and May 2019 including: synthetic ossicular replacement prosthesis, autograft interposition, bone cement repair, and mobilization of lateral chain fixation. Intervention: Cases were scored via middle ear risk index (MERI), surgical prosthetic infection tissue eustachian tube (SPITE) method, and ossiculoplasty outcome scoring parameter (OOPS) scale. Preoperative and postoperative hearing outcomes were recorded. Main Outcome Measure: Statistical correlation between risk score and postoperative pure-tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG). Results: The 179 included cases had average pre and postoperative PTA-ABGs of 30.3dB (standard deviation [SD] 12.7) and 20.3dB (SD 11.1), respectively. Mean MERI, SPITE, and OOPS scores were 4.5 (SD 2.3), 2.8 (SD 1.7), and 3.1 (SD 1.8), respectively. Statistically significant correlations with hearing outcome were noted for all three methods (MERI r = 0.22, p = 0.003; OOPS r = 0.19, p = 0.012; SPITE r = 0.27, p < 0.001). No scale predicted poor (PTA-ABG > 30dB) outcomes; only low SPITE scores predicted excellent (PTA-ABG < 10dB) outcomes (odds ratio [OR] 0.74 [Confidence Interval: 0.57 - 0.97], p = 0.032). Conclusions: Significant weak correlations between each middle ear risk score and hearing outcomes were encountered. Although only the SPITE method predicted postoperative PTA-ABG, it was not overwhelmingly superior. Current grading scale selection may be justified by familiarity or ease of use.

AB  - Background: Otosclerosis is one of the commonest diseases of the ear mostly involves the otic capsule. Most often otosclerotic foci appear in stapes region leading to stapes fixation, predominantly affect the adolescence female. The most common presenting symptom of clinical otosclerosis is conductive deafness. The mainstay of treatment for otosclerosis is surgery. Surgical options include stapedectomy, stapedotomy with or without stapedial tendon preservation. The latter being is the procedure of choice.
   Aim: The aim of this study is to compare the outcome of uncomfortable loudness level in stapedotomy with or without stapedial tendon preservation.
   Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU), Dhaka for 18 months in patients with otosclerosis. Total 30 subjects were selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patients were assessed pre-operatively by clinical examination, otoscopy and microscopic examination. Hearing was assessed by pure tone audiometry. Uncomfortable level and stapedial reflex threshold were tested in all cases. The selected cases were placed into two groups. Stapedial tendon resection in Group-I and stapedial tendon preservation in Group-II. Post-operative follow up was done at 3 months and 6 months. Hearing and uncomfortable loudness level were evaluated with PTA during follow up by calculating the average of 500Hz, 1000Hz, 2000Hz and 4000HZ. The data were calculated manually. The statistical significance was set to P< 0.05. Results of the study were expressed as mean, standard deviation (+/- SD), frequency and percentages. Means and standard deviations were reported for continuous variables. Frequencies and percentages were reported for categorical variables. Unpaired Student's t test was done to compare the continuous variables and Chi Square test was done to compare the categorical variables.
   Results: In this study preoperative average ABG for group I and group II were 35 +/- 4.57 dB and 34 +/- 4.17 dB respectively. In group I, post operative average ABG after 3 months and 6 months were 14 +/- 3.7 dB and 13 +/- 3.3 dB respectively. Post operative average ABG after 3 months was 13 +/- 5.7 dB and was 12 +/- 4.4 dB for group Il. But the hearing improvement between two groups was not statistically significant. In case of preoperative mean UCL was 95 +/- 1.8 dB and 96 +/- 2.5 dB for group I and group II respectively. Postoperative mean UCL after 3 months was 96 +/- 3.57 dB and after 6 months was 99 +/- 6.28 dB in group I. For group II, postoperative mean UCL after 3 months and 6 months was 107 +/- 4.2 dB and 113 +/- 3.2 dB respectively. Here mean UCL was on average 11 dB higher for group II in 3 months and additional 6 dB improvement noted after 6 months, but show minimal change in group I. This finding was statistically significant. Conclusion: Preservation of the stapedial tendon is the choice in the surgical treatment of otosclerosis which helps to improve functional outcomes as well as to provide the more physiologic protection of middle ear. Postoperative discomfort threshold levels were increased in patients who had their stapedial tendon restored.

AB  - Introduction: In developing countries, chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) accounted for 60-80% of middle ear disease. CSOM is a disease affecting, especially people with poor health, hygiene, and nutrition worldwide. Up to one-third of the population in developing countries has their quality of life affected by CSOM and its precursors. In children in developing countries CSOM is the most common cause of hearing impairment.
   Aim: The aim is to study the long-term hearing stability in patients who undergoing ossicular reconstruction using auto-or homo-graft ossicles taken from CSOM.
   Methods: Fifty cases of unsafe CSOM who underwent a modified radical mastoidectomy or radical mastoidectomy for their disease process were taken up for the study.
   Results: Out of 50 patients, 34 were male and 16 were female prominent age group being 20-45, all the patient had ear discharge and hard of hearing. Removed ossicles are examined and found pathology from inflammatory cell infiltration to sequestrum formation, and long process of incus is most common to affect.
   Conclusion: The long process of the incus is the most commonly eroded part of an ossicle in unsafe CSOM. Bone absorption is the most frequent pathological change and is usually observed where the granulation, inflammatory, or connective tissue with fibroblast is adjacent to the ossicle.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the facial nerve function and audiological results of delayed (by at least one month after the insult) transmastoid facial nerve decompression (FND) in traumatic facial nerve paralysis (FNP).
   METHODS: Medical records of 57 patients with traumatic FNP were reviewed and surgical results of 13 patients (mean age 28.0 +/- 17.67, range 3-67) undergoing transmastoid FND were analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative mean hearing thresholds were compared using 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz. Facial nerve function was graded according to the House-Brackmann scale (HB) before and after surgery. HB scale results of grade III or better were accepted as good results postoperatively.
   RESULTS: Preoperative HB grades were V in 5 and VI in 8 patients. Twelve of 13 patients had good recovery of facial nerve function regardless of the operation timing. When mean preoperative and postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) values were compared (except the patients with total sensorineural hearing loss), the mean preoperative ABG was 33 +/- 15.9 dB, and mean postoperative ABG was 17.2 +/- 8.68 dB. There was a mean hearing gain of 15.8 dB after transmastoid facial nerve decompression surgery. Surgery and anesthesia-related complications were not seen in any patients.
   CONCLUSION: The transmastoid route can be used safely and effectively with elimination of the risks of craniotomy and middle fossa surgery for patients with traumatic FNP. Hearing improvement can be achieved by performing ossicular chain reconstruction during decompression surgery for patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss (HL).

AB  - Background: Presently, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved adhesive bone cements for the surgical fixation of prosthetic materials in the middle ear, A promising new cement, 4-META/MMA-TBB opaque resin, has shown remarkable adhesive propel-ties as a bone cement in viva. The cement is composed of 4-methacryloyloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride (4-META) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) as monomers and tri-n-butyl borane (TBB) as an initiator.
   Methods: An electromagnetic semiimplantable hearing device presently under development was implanted into the middle ear of six cats using 4-META/MMA-TBB resin to cement a titanium-encased magnet to the incus, The animals were subsequently killed (at a mean of 9.6 months) to assess the temporal bones and specifically the magnet-incus complex in each animal.
   Results: The titanium-encapsulated magnet was firmly adherent to all incuses without any failure of the cement-bone interface. Histopathologic examination of the implanted temporal bones demonstrated lack of middle ear inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy of the incuses demonstrated a unique ''hybrid layer'' in the bone-side subsurface of the bone-cement interface that elucidates the mechanism of interfacial adhesion.
   Conclusions: Our investigation highlights the special biomechanical properties as well as the biocompatibility of 4-META/MMA-TBB resin that make it an attractive bone-bonding agent for use in otologic surgery, including its potential usefulness during ossicular reconstruction.

AB  - Aim of the present study is to evaluate the long term results of ossiculoplasty using titanium clip prosthesis. A retrospective analysis with prospective follow-up has been done including for all patients who had a Clip-PORP implanted between the years 2002-2013. Following this, audiometric hearing results were measured with clinical examination including otoscopy and quality of life evaluation using Glasgow benefit inventory. 48 patients (51 ears, 29 men, 19 women, average age 44.1 years) received followed up after an average duration of 6.3 years. The overall air-bone-gap (0.5-4kHz) decreased from 22.8dB preoperatively to 14.6dB postoperatively (p0.001). The most frequent indication for surgical treatment were cholesteatomas and recurrent cholesteatomas (52%), chronic inflammation of middle ear (12%), revision of radical mastoidectomy (8%) and disturbance in sound conduction after previous operation (14%). Tympanic membrane was closed in 47 times (92,2%), 4 times (7,8%) there was a defect. Clip-PORP was in situ 39 times (75%), protrusion and disposal were detected 6 times (11,8%) and 2 times (4%), respectively. However, 1 time (2%) the prothesis was lost or evaluation was not possible (3 times, 5,9%). The overall patient satisfaction and general subscale score after the treatment was beneficially evaluated. There was no change in social support score nore the physical health score. In summary, the ossicular chain reconstruction using titan Clip-PORP is safe and well established. Also in long-term analysis stable hearing results due to reduction of air bone gap are represented. The subjective quality of life is sustainable improved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to introduce and discuss the method of preoperative radiological diagnosis to the congenital absence or atresia of the oval window (OW), and the method of surgical treatment. From July 2010 through August 2014, patients with normal external canal and tympanic membrane but conductive hearing loss underwent high resolution CT scan (HRCT). The multiplanar reformation (MPR), a post-processing protocol, was used. The patients with diagnosis of OW atresia and malformed stapes preoperatively underwent surgical treatment. The vestibular drilled-out and promontory drilled-out technique was used to reconstruct the ossicular chain. In the preoperative radiological diagnosis, six patients (ears) were noted to have congenital absence or atresia of the oval window with malformed facial nerve (class 4) and two patients (ears) were found to have footplate fixation (class 2). In the surgical treatment of eight ears, the malformed structure was identified and the ossicular chain reconstruction was made in six ears. The coronal HRCT CT imaging and the MPR post-processing technique can provide us practical and definite information for surgical treatment, especially in the discrimination of OW atresia and the fixed stapedal footplate. The promontory drill-out technique, fenestration in the bottom of the basal turn, provides us a new method in the hearing reconstruction when the area of OW was fully covered by malformed facial nerve. This technique was first reported in the literature.

AB  - Objective. Assess the safety of performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on patients with stapes prostheses. Study Design: Survey and animal model. Methods. A survey regarding implant usage, MRI procedures, and adverse outcomes after MRI in patients previously undergoing stapes procedures. Guinea pigs implanted with ferromagnetic 17 to 4 stainless steel, 316L nonferromagnetic stainless steel, titanium, and fluoroplastic stapes prostheses underwent a MRI in a 4.7 Tesla MR system. Results: Three adverse outcomes were reported on the clinical survey. One adverse event occurred during an MRI performed on a recalled ferromagnetic prosthesis. The other two adverse events were probably not secondary to MRI exposure. No damage or inflammation was observed in the region of the oval window or vestibule of implanted guinea pigs exposed to a 4.7 Tesla MR system. Conclusions. The combination of prior studies, the clinical survey, and the absence of histopathologic evidence of damage in the guinea pigs is compelling evidence that MRI for patients with stapes prostheses is safe. Implanting physicians should feel comfortable clearing a patient for a MRI in a 1.5 Tesla or 3.0 Tesla MRI. It is imperative for the physician to qualify the field strength when clearing a patient to undergo a MRI.

AB  - Objective: To review the outcome in consecutive patients who have undergone complete epitympanic and mastoid obliteration and concurrent tympanic membrane reconstruction over a 53-month period.
   Study Design: Retrospective review.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: Sixty-two ears in 56 sequential patients undergoing mastoid obliteration with major indications including recurrent infection, debris trapping in the canal wall-down cavity, intolerance of water exposure, calorically induced vertigo in an existing cavity, a semicircular canal fistula, and inability to wear a hearing device. Thirty-six ears in 33 patients who underwent second-stage surgery for ossicular reconstruction during the same time period are also reviewed. Intervention: Transplanted autogenous cranial bone is used to induce osteoneogenesis resulting in complete obliteration of the epitympanic and mastoid spaces while maintaining a mesotympanic space.
   Main Outcome Measures: Success of obliteration, incidence of symptoms prompting intervention, hearing outcome, incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma, and incidence of eustachian tube dysfunction necessitating treatment and need for revision surgical procedures.
   Results: Complete take of the bony obliteration occurs in over 95% of cases; 90% of treated patients enjoy complete absence of original symptoms, whereas symptoms improved in the remainder. For over 95% of patients, existing eustachian tube function has been adequate after obliteration. To date, no patient has required revision surgical intervention.
   Conclusion: Mastoid obliteration with autogenous cranial bone is a safe and extremely effective option for treatment of problematic canal wall-down mastoid cavities. Surgical techniques that include sterile harvest of the cranial bone graft mixed with antibiotic, revision of the cavity to expose viable native bone, inclusion of the epitympanic spaces in the obliteration, and complete coverage of the pate with autogenous fascia have proven critical to successful outcome.

Patients with middle ear cholesteatoma were excluded. The main outcome was postoperative otorrhea, as indicated by Merchant grading.ResultsIn total, 97 patients were included. The median postoperative follow-up time was 3.9 years (range 0.5-10.4). Average time between the original canal wall down surgery and the secondary obliteration was 25.3 years (SD 11.7, range 2-66). At the most recent follow-up visit, a Merchant grade of 0 to 1 was observed in 95% of the cases. There were no cases of sensorineural hearing loss or facial palsy, one case developed a retro auricular skin defect and 1 patient developed CSF leakage. Minor complications were seen in 10 patients (10%). Ossicular chain reconstruction with a titanium prosthesis was performed in 42 cases, resulting in a median improvement of 11.2 dB in air conduction thresholds. In 9/42 cases (21%), closure of the postoperative air-bone gap to <= 20 dB was achieved. Twenty-five percent of cases could be discharged from out-patient visits.ConclusionRevision of persistently draining radical cavities with BAG obliteration is feasible and results in a dry and safe ear in 95% of the patients, thereby enabling wearing of a conventional hearing aid. Out-patient visits could be ceased in 25% of the cases.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Ossicular defect is although more common in squamosal type of chronic suppurative otitis media, it can also occur in mucosal type of the disease. Its preoperative knowledge not only helps surgeon to plan for ossicular reconstruction in a better way but also to counsel the patient accordingly. We wanted to determine the prevalence of ossicular chain defect and preoperative identification of clinical and audiological factors as indicators of ossicular defects in patients with Mucosal CSOM.
   METHODS
   This is a hospital based cross sectional study of 2 years. Patients 15 to 60 years of age, having inactive mucosal type of Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media, posted for Tympanoplasty were included in the study. Findings on history, clinical, audiological and intraoperative otomicroscopic examination were recorded and analysed.
   RESULTS
   Ossicular necrosis was noted in 21 (23.33%) of total 90 patients. On statistical analysis, patients of age >30 years (p=0.019, duration of ear discharge > 10 years (p=0.003), those having large and subtotal perforation (p<0.001), adhesion of tympanic membrane edges to promontory (p=0.04), incudostapaedial joint area exposure (p=0.01) and air-one gap >40 dB (p<0.001) were found to be statistically significantly associated with ossicular erosion.
   CONCLUSIONS
   All patients of mucosal type of chronic suppurative otitis media should be assessed in detail so as to get a clue of ossicular defects to be prepared for its repair and will not come as a surprise during surgery.

AB  - Objective: To analyze clinical presentation, modes of detection, growth pattern, operative findings, and results of surgery in children 3 years old or older who had extensive congenital cholesteatoma (keratoma).
   Design: Survey, case series.
   Setting: Two academically affiliated medical centers: a children's hospital and an eye, ear, and throat hospital, both located in major metropolitan cities.
   Patient: Twenty-five children selected according to specified criteria.
   Intervention: Tympanomastoid surgery, ie, canal wall up and canal wall down, some with ossicular reconstructive surgery.
   Main Outcome Measure: Audiologic assessment (speech reception threshold) and recurrence (recidivism) of cholesteatoma.
   Results: Incidence of recidivism, 52%. Hearing maintained within the range of normal to mild hearing impairment postoperatively in 91% of the patients for whom complete data are available.
   Conclusions: Congenital cholesteatoma may grow for years without causing signs or symptoms and, having grown without early detection, can extend to involve the epitympanum and mastoid antrum, cause ossicular erosion, and even extend to the middle cranial fossa. To adequately remove a congenital cholesteatoma that has gone undetected for many years, exposure of the anterior epitympanum is often necessary and removal of both the body of the incus and the head of the malleus often is required. Since congenital cholesteatoma usually develops in a child with a well-pneumatized mastoid that would create a large mastoid bowl if exteriorized, the otologic surgeon is likely to hesitate in using the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique. Alternatives to the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique, which can achieve reasonably good hearing results and avoid creation of a large mastoid bowl, include planned two-stage canal wall up surgery or canal preservation with primary reconstruction and close follow-up with otomicroscopy and serial computed tomographic scans.

AB  - Introduction: In chronic otitis media,the reconstruction of the middle ear's sound conducting system involves repairing the tympanic membrane and filling the space between ossicular chain remnants. The final shape of the prosthesis is usually determined intraoperatively. However, the ossicular chain may be preoperatively measured using computed tomography (CT) scans, and an individualized prosthesis can be designed. Custom 3D printing seems to be an attractive solution for optimal adjustment.
   Aim: Our study aimed to assess the 3D-printed custom prosthesis movability and compare it to the original ossicular chain.
   Material and methods: Five fresh-frozen temporal bone specimens were used. Using Cone-Beam CT scans, the incus model was designed individually and 3D-printed. The ossicular chain was reconstructed inside the cadaveric temporal bone. Acoustic stimuli were applied to the external ear canal one frequency at a time. The laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) measured the intact and 3D-printed prosthesis reconstructed ossicular chain vibrations.
   Results: At all stimulation frequencies, there was no significant difference in velocity values between the intact and reconstructed ossicular chain at the intensity of 80 dB SPL. The obtained values of the velocity gain were: -7.9 (SD-19) dB, -6.8 (SD8.12) dB, -10,9 (SD-5.3) dB, -7.4 (SD-8.16) dB for 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz, respectively. The vibration threshold shift values ranged between -0.57 dB at 500 Hz and 3.81 dB at 2000 Hz.
   Conclusions: This study analyzed the movability of individualized 3D-printed custom ossicular prostheses using LDV. Compared to the intact ossicular chain, the reconstructed ossicular chain movability was characterized by statistically insignificant reduced movability at all tested frequencies. Because the prosthesis's new design conception as custom 3D individualized printing allows for patient-specific ossiculoplasty, it represents a promising new direction for ossicular chain reconstruction. It seems to be an attractive solution for prosthesis optimal adjustment and, hopefully, better hearing results.

AB  - Objective: To determine which ear environment risk factors impact ossiculoplasty hearing outcomes and to generate a statistically-valid grading system for ossiculoplasty outcome reporting. Study Type: Retrospective case series. Methods: A multi-institutional database was generated from cases performed between 2011 and 2019. Preoperative and postoperative hearing thresholds were recorded alongside potential ear environment risk factors. Multiple variable linear regression statistical analyses of risk factors were applied to determine independent association with postoperative pure tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG). Significant factors were used to generate a statistically-weighted grading scale of Ear Environment Risk (EER). Results: 1679 cases had a mean follow-up time of 33.6 months (SD 36.3) and a mean postoperative PTA-ABG of 21.2 (SD 12.8). Multiple revision status (p < 0.001), presence of canal wall down mastoidectomy cavity (p = 0.020), absent malleus (p < 0.001), absent stapes superstructure (p = 0.016), frequent otorrhea (p = 0.008), pediatric age (p < 0.001), and blunted/lateralized tympanic membrane (p = 0.003) were independently correlated with PTA-ABG. These factors were incorporated into an EER Scoring System with four distinct risk groups wherein each risk group was significantly correlated with PTA-ABG, and this grading system was better correlated with PTA-ABG (Kendall's tau = 0.193) than other existing published grading scales. Conclusion: Grading environment risk according to a novel EER scoring system generates meaningful risk groupings that correlate with ossiculoplasty postoperative PTA-ABG, and this holds potential to frame reporting of hearing outcomes for future ossiculoplasty research.

AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) continues to be an important public health problem despite significant advances in medical science. Ear discharge, pain, discomfort, difficulty in hearing, limitation of routine activities and emotional problems due to CSOM cause a significant impact on the health and general well being of the patient. We have done Type 1 tympanoplasty in tubotympanic type of COM to reconstruct the tympanic membrane and alleviate the symptoms of the patients. This study presents an analysis of the impact of the surgery on the patient subjectively and its correlation with objective outcomes. 45 patients were selected to fill the chronic otitis media-5 (COM-5) questionnaire and underwent pure tone audiometry preoperatively. All the patients underwent Type 1 tympanoplasty by using temporalis fascia graft. The status of the ossicles was checked and documented intraoperatively. Patients requiring ossicular reconstruction or with attico antral disease were excluded. Patients were followed up for a period of 6 months and those with an intact graft after 6 months were included in the study. These patients were again made to fill the questionnaire and undergo pure tone audiometry postoperatively. 37 out of 45 patients (82 %) had an intact graft 6 months after surgery. Marked improvement was observed in subjective scores as documented by the questionnaire, pre- and postoperatively with the mean improvement in total scores being 7.89 +/- 4.81 on a Visual Analogue Scale. Also significant improvement was achieved in closure of air-bone gap with the mean improvement being 14.73 +/- 8.58 dB. Significant correlation was found between subjective and objective scores in most patients. This study showed that Type 1 tympanoplasty brings about a significant improvement in the quality of life of chronic suppurative otitis media patients. Most patients showed a marked improvement in subjective scores which correlated well with the objective findings of the status of the graft and improvement in air-bone gap. Asymptomatic patients with less preoperative scores showed less improvement in subjective scores which did not correlate with the objective outcomes.

AB  - Sensorineural losses of hearing and vestibular sensation due to hair cell dysfunction are among the most common disabilities. Recent preclinical research demonstrates that treatment of the inner ear with a variety of compounds, including gene therapy agents, may elicit regeneration and/or repair of hair cells in animals exposed to ototoxic medications or other insults to the inner ear. Delivery of gene therapy may also offer a means for treatment of hereditary hearing loss. However, injection of a fluid volume sufficient to deliver an adequate dose of a pharmacologic agent could, in theory, cause inner ear trauma that compromises functional outcome. The primary goal of the present study was to assess that risk in rhesus monkeys, which closely approximates humans with regard to middle and inner ear anatomy. Secondary goals were to identify the best delivery route into the primate ear from among two common surgical approaches (i.e., via an oval window stapedotomy and via the round window) and to determine the relative volumes of rhesus, rodent, and human labyrinths for extrapolation of results to other species. We measured hearing and vestibular functions before and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after unilateral injection of phosphate-buffered saline vehicle (PBSV) into the perilymphatic space of normal rhesus monkeys at volumes sufficient to deliver an atoh1 gene therapy vector. To isolate effects of injection, PBSV without vector was used. Assays included behavioral observation, auditory brainstem responses, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and scleral coil measurement of vestibulo-ocular reflexes during whole-body rotation in darkness. Three groups (N = 3 each) were studied. Group A received a 10 mu L transmastoid/trans-stapes injection via a laser stapedotomy. Group B received a 10 mu L transmastoid/trans-round window injection. Group C received a 30 mu L transmastoid/trans-round window injection. We also measured inner ear fluid space volume via 3D reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images of adult C57BL6 mouse, rat, rhesus macaque, and human temporal bones (N = 3 each). Injection was well tolerated by all animals, with eight of nine exhibiting no signs of disequilibrium and one animal exhibiting transient disequilibrium that resolved spontaneously by 24 h after surgery. Physiologic results at the final, 8-week post-injection measurement showed that injection was well tolerated. Compared to its pretreatment values, no treated ear's ABR threshold had worsened by more than 5 dB at any stimulus frequency; distortion product otoacoustic emissions remained detectable above the noise floor for every treated ear (mean, SD and maximum deviation from baseline: -1.3, 9.0, and -18 dB, respectively); and no animal exhibited a reduction of more than 3 % in vestibulo-ocular reflex gain during high-acceleration, whole-body, passive yaw rotations in darkness toward the treated side. All control ears and all operated ears with definite histologic evidence of injection through the intended site showed similar findings, with intact hair cells in all five inner ear sensory epithelia and intact auditory/vestibular neurons. The relative volumes of mouse, rat, rhesus, and human inner ears as measured by CT were (mean +/- SD) 2.5 +/- 0.1, 5.5 +/- 0.4, 59.4 +/- 4.7 and 191.1 +/- 4.7 mu L. These results indicate that injection of PBSV at volumes sufficient for gene therapy delivery can be accomplished without destruction of inner ear structures required for hearing and vestibular sensation.

AB  - Hypothesis: The adhesive octylcyanoacrylate is not associated with significant inner ear toxicity in a guinea pig model.
   Background: Many cyanoacrylate adhesives have been investigated For use in otologic surgery, but variable ototoxicity has been reported. Octylcyanoacrylate is a medical-grade adhesive with many properties that make it ideal for use in the car. It is free of contaminants; it forms a strong, flexible bond, and it inhibits the growth of gram-positive organisms in culture. This is the first study to assess the ototoxicity of this new adhesive.
   Methods: Fourteen adult guinea pigs were used. Preoperative auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were determined. Bilateral antrotomies were performed, and the ears were randomized to adhesive and control (saline) groups. In the adhesive ears, 0.5 or 0.1 mt of octylcyanoacrylate was instilled into the middle ear. Eight weeks later, postoperative ABRs were determined, the animals were killed, and the temporal bones were removed. Middle ear changes were noted, and the ossicular chain was assessed. Cochlear hair cell analyses were performed. Histologic assessment of the middle ear mucosa was performed.
   Results: There was a higher incidence of conductive hearing loss in the adhesive group secondary to fixation of the ossicular chain, but there was no significant difference in bone conduction thresholds. The median postoperative bone conduction thresholds (dB peak sound pressure level) was 15.0 in the control group and 17.5 in the adhesive group, p = 0.89. There was also no significant difference in inner hail cell counts (0.4% vs. 0.5% median hair cell loss, p = 0.72) or outer hair cell counts (3.78 vs. 3.0% median hair cell loss, p = 0.23) for the adhesive and control groups, respectively. Histopathologic analysis of the middle ear mucosa demonstrated variable mild to moderate foreign body reaction with no evidence of mucosal ulceration or necrosis.
   Conclusions: A large amount of octylcyanoacrylate placed in the middle ear of the guinea pig did not cause any morphologic or functional evidence of inner car toxicity. This new adhesive is a promising tool for otologic surgery.

AB  - PurposeOtosclerosis leads to a fixed stapes footplate and thus to hearing loss. The predominant treatment method is surgery, with various types of stapes prostheses available. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the new mAXIS Stapes Prosthesis.Methods34 cases of otosclerosis were implanted with the new mAXIS Stapes Prosthesis. Comprehensive clinical assessments, including pre- and postoperative pure tone audiometry was performed at short-term (ST) follow-up at 25 (+/- 15) days and mid-term (MT) follow-up at 181 (+/- 107) days. The pure tone average of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz (PTA4) was calculated.ResultsIn all cases, the application of the prosthesis was successful and straightforward. The postoperative PTA4 air-bone gap was 10.7 +/- 5.2 dB at ST follow-up (n = 34) and 8.3 +/- 4.1 dB at MT follow-up (n = 18). In 61% of cases, the ABG-closure was within 10 dB and in 100% of cases within 20 dB at MT follow-up.ConclusionFindings of this study support that the mAXIS Stapes Prosthesis is safe for implantation and shows promising audiological outcome. Future investigations will contribute its long-term efficacy and safety profile.

AB  - Objectives Access to and utilization of perioperative healthcare may influence outcomes in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM); however, the influencing factors are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to assess the association of sociodemographic factors with perioperative health care utilization for pediatric CSOM patients. Methods We conducted a review on pediatric CSOM patients (<= 18 years old) who underwent tympanoplasty with/without mastoidectomy between 2010 and 2020. Sociodemographic data and clinical were collected on all participants. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between these factors and perioperative care utilization. Results 427 patients were included in the study. The primary factor associated with health care utilization was insurance status. Rural children were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (p = 0.048). For tympanoplasty patients, Medicaid patients have 1.66 higher odds of pre-operative no-shows (p = 0.01), 1.31 higher odds of post-operative no-shows (p = 0.02), and 59% lower odds of having a postoperative audiogram (p = 0.01), and 2.64 higher odds of being from a rural community (p = 0.02). For patients undergoing mastoidectomy, Medicaid patients have 1.25 higher odds of postoperative no-shows (p = 0.01), 39% lower odds of having a revision procedure for ossicular reconstruction (p = 0.045). Appalachian rural mastoidectomy patients had 3.62 higher odds of having cholesteatoma (p = 0.05). Conclusion Pediatric patients with CSOM who have Medicaid insurance, especially those who reside in rural regions, are at risk for lower perioperative hearing health care utilization. As these findings may impact care delivery and clinical outcomes, efforts should be focused on promoting utilization among these populations. Level of Evidence 4 Laryngoscope, 2022

AB  - To analyze the results of repair defect of the ear canal with autologous bone containing periosteum and hearing reconstruction and postoperative inflation. Retrospective analysis of the 40 cases of surgeries conducted by senior surgeon. All cases received full open surgeries. Preoperative air conduction (AC) was 67.47 +/- 14.32 dBHL, and GAP was 45.95 +/- 12.63 dBHL. These cases were divided into two groups: the first 20 ears received repair surgery for radical mastoid cavity with bone slice containing periosteum combined with ear ossicle remodeling, namely the bone slice group. For another 20 ears, inflator was additionally used and the mastoid antrum cavity was inflated twice a day, namely the inflation group. Follow-up: 9-60 months (median follow-up of 26 months). Statistical analysis: U test was adopted. All ear canal showed a smooth appearance. Eight cases received CT scans and presenting re-gasification of attic and/or mastoid cavity. Hearing: AC of 47.32 +/- 15.63 dBHL, and GAP of 18.28 +/- 15.28 dBHL, both P values were <0.01 as compared with that before operation, and the difference was highly significant. 23 cases showed GAP <20 dB, and one case showed GAP >20 at follow-up, but narrowing was >30 dB, and these 24 cases were successful case, with a success rate = 60 %. 16 cases with GAP <10 dB, although 4 cases with GAP >10 dB, narrowing was >30 dB, thus the 20 cases were markedly effective, and with ratio = 50 %. The gap of 30 cases was narrowed more than 15 dB, although two cases showed gap narrowing less than 15 dB, postoperative GAP was less than 10 dB, both were valid, with an efficacy of 32/40 = 80 %, 18 cases (45 %) with AC <40 dBHL. Sub-group analysis: age: group P < 0.05 when the two groups were compared, difference in ages of the two groups were significant, and the age of the inflation group was older. Both GAP and AC of the two groups showed no significant difference before and after the surgery. One case in the bone slice group showed poor postoperative hearing, adhesion was found between the mesotympanum and attic in reoperation, and best result of GAP Close to less than 10 dB was obtained using the decomposition method after inflation. Bone slice containing periosteum can be used for reconstruct the normal ear canal. Auxiliary inflation of middle ear can even promote the tympanic re-gasification and hearing recovery.

AB  - Background
   Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common adverse effect of anaesthesia and surgery. Up to 80% of patients may be affected. These outcomes are a major cause of patient dissatisfaction and may lead to prolonged hospital stay and higher costs of care along with more severe complications. Many antiemetic drugs are available for prophylaxis. They have various mechanisms of action and side effects, but there is still uncertainty about which drugs are most effective with the fewest side effects.
   Objectives:
   To compare the efficacy and safety of different prophylactic pharmacologic interventions (antiemetic drugs) against no treatment, against placebo, or against each other (as monotherapy or combination prophylaxis) for prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting in adults undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia
   To generate a clinically useful ranking of antiemetic drugs (monotherapy and combination prophylaxis) based on efficacy and safety
   To identify the best dose or dose range of antiemetic drugs in terms of efficacy and safety
   SEARCH METHODS
   We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP), ClinicalTrials.gov, and reference lists of relevant systematic reviews. The first search was performed in November 2017 and was updated in April 2020. In the update of the search, 39 eligible studies were found that were not included in the analysis (listed as awaiting classification).
   Selection criteria
   Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing effectiveness or side effects of single antiemetic drugs in any dose or combination against each other or against an inactive control in adults undergoing any type of surgery under general anaesthesia. All antiemetic drugs belonged to one of the following substance classes: 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, D2 receptor antagonists, NK1 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, antihistamines, and anticholinergics. No language restrictions were applied. Abstract publications were excluded.
   Data collection and analysis
   A review team of 11 authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias and subsequently extracted data. We performed pair-wise meta-analyses for drugs of direct interest (amisulpride, aprepitant, casopitant, dexamethasone, dimenhydrinate, dolasetron, droperidol, fosaprepitant, granisetron, haloperidol, meclizine, methylprednisolone, metoclopramide, ondansetron, palonosetron, perphenazine, promethazine, ramosetron, rolapitant, scopolamine, and tropisetron) compared to placebo (inactive control). We performed network meta-analyses (NMAs) to estimate the relative effects and ranking (with placebo as reference) of all available single drugs and combinations. Primary outcomes were vomiting within 24 hours postoperatively, serious adverse events (SAEs), and any adverse event (AE). Secondary outcomes were drug class-specific side effects (e.g. headache), mortality, early and late vomiting, nausea, and complete response. We performed subgroup network meta-analysis with dose of drugs as a moderator variable using dose ranges based on previous consensus recommendations. We assessed certainty of evidence of NMA treatment effects for all primary outcomes and drug class-specific side effects according to GRADE (CINeMA, Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis). We restricted GRADE assessment to single drugs of direct interest compared to placebo.
   Main results
   We included 585 studies (97,516 randomized participants). Most of these studies were small (median sample size of 100); they were published between 1965 and 2017 and were primarily conducted in Asia (51%), Europe (25%), and North America (16%). Mean age of the overall population was 42 years. Most participants were women (83%), had American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II (70%), received perioperative opioids (88%), and underwent gynaecologic (32%) or gastrointestinal surgery (19%) under general anaesthesia using volatile anaesthetics (88%).
   In this review, 44 single drugs and 51 drug combinations were compared. Most studies investigated only single drugs (72%) and included an inactive control arm (66%). The three most investigated single drugs in this review were ondansetron (246 studies), dexamethasone (120 studies), and droperidol (97 studies).
   Almost all studies (89%) reported at least one efficacy outcome relevant for this review. However, only 56% reported at least one relevant safety outcome.
   Altogether, 157 studies (27%) were assessed as having overall low risk of bias, 101 studies (17%) overall high risk of bias, and 327 studies (56%) overall unclear risk of bias.
   Vomiting within 24 hours postoperatively
   Relative effects from NMA for vomiting within 24 hours (282 RCTs, 50,812 participants, 28 single drugs, and 36 drug combinations) suggest that 29 out of 36 drug combinations and 10 out of 28 single drugs showed a clinically important benefit (defined as the upper end of the 95% confidence interval (CI) below a risk ratio (RR) of 0.8) compared to placebo. Combinations of drugs were generally more effective than single drugs in preventing vomiting. However, single NK1 receptor antagonists showed treatment effects similar to most of the drug combinations. High-certainty evidence suggests that the following single drugs reduce vomiting (ordered by decreasing efficacy): aprepitant (RR 0.26, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.38, high certainty, rank 3/28 of single drugs); ramosetron (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.59, high certainty, rank 5/28); granisetron (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.54, high certainty, rank 6/28); dexamethasone (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.57, high certainty, rank 8/28); and ondansetron (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.60, high certainty, rank 13/28). Moderate-certainty evidence suggests that the following single drugs probably reduce vomiting: fosaprepitant (RR 0.06, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.21, moderate certainty, rank 1/28) and droperidol (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.69, moderate certainty, rank 20/28).
   Recommended and high doses of granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol showed clinically important benefit, but low doses showed no clinically important benefit. Aprepitant was used mainly at high doses, ramosetron at recommended doses, and fosaprepitant at doses of 150 mg (with no dose recommendation available).
   Frequency of SAEs
   Twenty-eight RCTs were included in the NMA for SAEs (10,766 participants, 13 single drugs, and eight drug combinations). The certainty of evidence for SAEs when using one of the best and most reliable anti-vomiting drugs (aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol compared to placebo) ranged from very low to low. Droperidol (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.08 to 9.71, low certainty, rank 6/13) may reduce SAEs. We are uncertain about the effects of aprepitant (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.26 to 7.36, very low certainty, rank 11/13), ramosetron (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.05 to 15.74, very low certainty, rank 7/13), granisetron (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.11 to 13.15, very low certainty, rank 10/13), dexamethasone (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.28 to 4.85, very low certainty, rank 9/13), and ondansetron (RR 1.62, 95% CI 0.32 to 8.10, very low certainty, rank 12/13). No studies reporting SAEs were available for fosaprepitant.
   Frequency of any AE
   Sixty-one RCTs were included in the NMA for any AE (19,423 participants, 15 single drugs, and 11 drug combinations). The certainty of evidence for any AE when using one of the best and most reliable anti-vomiting drugs (aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol compared to placebo) ranged from very low to moderate. Granisetron (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.05, moderate certainty, rank 7/15) probably has no or little effect on any AE. Dexamethasone (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.08, low certainty, rank 2/15) and droperidol (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.98, low certainty, rank 6/15) may reduce any AE. Ondansetron (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.01, low certainty, rank 9/15) may have little or no effect on any AE. We are uncertain about the effects of aprepitant (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97, very low certainty, rank 3/15) and ramosetron (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.54, very low certainty, rank 11/15) on any AE. No studies reporting any AE were available for fosaprepitant.
   Class-specific side effects
   For class-specific side effects (headache, constipation, wound infection, extrapyramidal symptoms, sedation, arrhythmia, and QT prolongation) of relevant substances, the certainty of evidence for the best and most reliable anti-vomiting drugs mostly ranged from very low to low. Exceptions were that ondansetron probably increases headache (RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.28, moderate certainty, rank 18/23) and probably reduces sedation (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.96, moderate certainty, rank 5/24) compared to placebo. The latter effect is limited to recommended and high doses of ondansetron. Droperidol probably reduces headache (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.86, moderate certainty, rank 5/23) compared to placebo. We have high-certainty evidence that dexamethasone (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09, high certainty, rank 16/24) has no effect on sedation compared to placebo. No studies assessed substance class-specific side effects for fosaprepitant.
   Direction and magnitude of network effect estimates together with level of evidence certainty are graphically summarized for all pre-defined GRADE-relevant outcomes and all drugs of direct interest compared to placebo in http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4066353.
   Authors' conclusions
   We found high-certainty evidence that five single drugs (aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, and ondansetron) reduce vomiting, and moderate-certainty evidence that two other single drugs (fosaprepitant and droperidol) probably reduce vomiting, compared to placebo. Four of the six substance classes (5-HT3 receptor antagonists, D2 receptor antagonists, NK1 receptor antagonists, and corticosteroids) were thus represented by at least one drug with important benefit for prevention of vomiting. Combinations of drugs were generally more effective than the corresponding single drugs in preventing vomiting. NK1 receptor antagonists were the most effective drug class and had comparable efficacy to most of the drug combinations. 5-HT3 receptor antagonists were the best studied substance class. For most of the single drugs of direct interest, we found only very low to low certainty evidence for safety outcomes such as occurrence of SAEs, any AE, and substance class-specific side effects.
   Recommended and high doses of granisetron, dexamethasone, ondansetron, and droperidol were more effective than low doses for prevention of vomiting. Dose dependency of side effects was rarely found due to the limited number of studies, except for the less sedating effect of recommended and high doses of ondansetron.
   The results of the review are transferable mainly to patients at higher risk of nausea and vomiting (i.e. healthy women undergoing inhalational anaesthesia and receiving perioperative opioids). Overall study quality was limited, but certainty assessments of effect estimates consider this limitation. No further efficacy studies are needed as there is evidence of moderate to high certainty for seven single drugs with relevant benefit for prevention of vomiting. However, additional studies are needed to investigate potential side effects of these drugs and to examine higher-risk patient populations (e.g. individuals with diabetes and heart disease).
   PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY
   Which medicines work best to prevent people from being sick (vomiting) after an operation?
   Why are people sick after an operation?
   Feeling sick (nausea) or being sick (vomiting) is a common unwanted eMect of general anaesthesia-medicine that makes people unconscious and unresponsive so they don't move or feel pain during an operation.
   Most unwanted effects of general anaesthesia, including feeling or being sick, happen immediately and stop after a few hours, although some people may continue to feel sick for up to a day. If people carry on feeling or being sick, they might have to stay in hospital longer than expected and may experience other unwanted effects or complications.
   Women are more likely to be sick after an operation, as are people taking opioid painkillers, those who have had motion sickness, and those who have been sick after previous operations.
   Medicines to prevent people from being sick
   Medicines called antiemetics are given to prevent people from feeling or being sick. These medicines may be given before or during anaesthesia.
   Antiemetic medicines are grouped into six main classes based on how they act. Combining medicines from different classes sometimes makes them work better.
   Why we did this Cochrane Review
   We wanted to find out which medicines work best to prevent people from being sick after an operation and cause the fewest unwanted effects. Some unwanted effects of antiemetic medicines include headache, constipation, movement disorders such as tremors, sleepiness, irregular heartbeat, and wound infection.
   What did we do?
   We searched for studies that looked at the use of antiemetic medicines in adults having general anaesthesia to prevent people from being sick afterwards.
   We looked for randomized controlled studies, in which the treatments people received were decided at random. This type of study usually gives the most reliable evidence about the effects of a treatment.
   Search date
   We included evidence published up to November 2017; in April 2020, we found another 39 studies, which are not yet included in the analysis.
   What we found
   We found 585 studies in 97,516 people who were given antiemetic medicines before or during general anaesthesia. People included in the studies were more likely to be sick after anaesthesia, as 83% were women and 88% were taking opioid painkillers. Most studies were conducted in Asia, Europe, or North America.
   These studies either measured how many people were sick in the first 24 hours after their operation or how many unwanted effects were reported, or both of these outcomes. Most studies compared medicines (given alone or in combination) with a dummy (placebo) treatment.
   We compared all antiemetic medicines with each other using a mathematical method called network meta-analysis.
   What were our main results and how reliable are these results?
   Compared with placebo treatment, 10 out of 28 single medicines and 29 out of 36 combinations of medicines prevented people from being sick in the first 24 hours after their operation (282 studies). Combinations of antiemetic medicines generally worked better than single medicines given alone. However, aprepitant, casopitant, and fosaprepitant worked as well alone as most combinations of antiemetics. The single medicine that worked best in the ranking of all medicines was fosaprepitant, followed by casopitant, aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, tropisetron, ondansetron, dolasetron, and droperidol.
   We are confident that aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, and ondansetron prevent people from being sick. We are moderately confident about how well fosaprepitant and droperidol work, but this finding may change when further evidence becomes available. We are uncertain about how well casopitant, tropisetron, and dolasetron work.
   Not all studies looked at serious, life-threatening unwanted effects. We are uncertain how many of these effects were reported when taking an antiemetic medicine and whether serious, life-threatening unwanted effects occur at a similar rate or are reduced compared to placebo (28 studies).
   Of the best medicines with most reliable evidence for preventing being sick, granisetron and ondansetron probably made little to no difference in the occurrence of unwanted effects compared to placebo, whereas dexamethasone and droperidol may cause fewer unwanted effects than placebo. We are uncertain about unwanted effects with aprepitant and ramosetron (61 studies). We found no studies looking at unwanted effects for fosaprepitant.
   We are less confident about unwanted effects of other antiemetic medicines because we found little reliable evidence about this. Our results for unwanted effects are likely to change when further evidence is available.
   Conclusions
   For people at higher risk, we found that some antiemetic medicines work well to prevent them from being sick after general anaesthesia. The best antiemetic medicines with reliable evidence were aprepitant, ramosetron, granisetron, dexamethasone, and ondansetron, followed by fosaprepitant and droperidol.
   However, we did not find enough reliable evidence about potential unwanted effects to rank these medicines reliably according to how well they are tolerated.

AB  - We describe the youngest case of bilateral stapes agenesis and systematically reviewed the literature. Among those cases, 8/12 (66.7%) showed a bilateral agenesis. There is a male predominance 8/12 (66.7%). The most common associated anomaly reported being either a dehiscent or displaced facial nerve (7/12-58%). Furthermore, 5/12 patients (42%) had a narrow or an absent oval window. In our case, a 5-year-old male patient was referred for bilateral conductive hearing loss (air-bone gap 65 dB, bilateral). Operating findings on the left side included an inferiorly displaced facial nerve over the promontory, a narrow ossified oval window and an absent stapes. A stapedotomy with insertion of a modified stapes prosthesis allowed us to close the conductive gap. Even with possible good outcomes, surgical management should not be taken lightly, considering amplification is almost always a safe and effective option.

AB  - The effect of different stapes prostheses on the basilar membrane (BM) motion was determined. To that end, a three dimensional finite element (FE) model of the passive human cochlea was developed. Passive responses of the BM were found based on coupled fluid structure interactions between the cochlear solid structures and the scala fluids. The passive BM vibrations in normal (healthy) cochlea were compared with vibrations in the cochlea in which a 0.4-mm piston or a proposed new type of prosthesis was implanted. The proposed chamber prosthesis was not experimentally implanted, but only numerically simulated. Design of the new chamber stapes prosthesis is presented for the first time in this paper. The simulation results showed 10-20 dB decrease in BM displacement amplitude in the case of the piston. In contrast, the BM responses in the cochlea with the new prosthesis are higher with respect to the healthy ear. The results obtained in this study are promising for further research to optimize the design of the new chamber stapes prosthesis. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objective of this study was to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after sequential cholesteatoma surgery including exclusively transcanal technique (ETC), combined transcanal transmastoidal technique (TCM) and canal wall down surgery with obliteration (CWD). It was a clinical case study conducted in a tertiary referral center. 97 patients at least 12 months after cholesteatoma surgery were included. Interventions included sequential cholesteatoma surgery with ETC, TCM or CWD; ossiculoplasty with partial and total ossicular replacement prostheses. HRQOL assessed by Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 including an overall score and three subscores ('ear symptoms', 'hearing function' and 'mental health') as well as a general evaluation of HRQOL and the frequency of physician consultations, audiometric outcome related to HRQOL were the main outcome measures. Patients, who had undergone sequential cholesteatoma surgery, showed moderate restrictions in HRQOL postoperatively. Stratified for the three surgical techniques, patients receiving ETC tended to report lower restrictions in HRQOL. The ETC group offered a significantly lower value in the subscore 'ear symptoms'. The 'hearing function' was attributed to be the most restriction criteria for all techniques. The overall score and all subscores correlated moderately with the postoperative air conduction threshold. The strongest correlation coefficient was achieved for the subscore 'hearing function' (r (s) = 0.49, p < 0.001). Sequential cholesteatoma surgery offers acceptable moderate restrictions in HRQOL postoperatively. Patients receiving canal wall down surgery with obliteration showed equivalent limitations in HRQOL compared to closed techniques (ETC, TCM). The postoperative air conduction threshold was shown not to be a sufficient indicator for HRQOL. Therefore, disease-specific validated and reliable measuring instruments for HRQOL should be transferred from clinical research to clinical practice to provide an individualized postoperative assessment after cholesteatoma surgery.

AB  - The clothespin partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) is designed to increase joint stability during incus replacement ossiculoplasty. Fundamental modifications have been made in the Schuring ossicle-cup, which include a forked well, increased well wall thickness and length, and a flexible tip disk added to the shaft. The forked well functions like a straight clothespin rather than an inverted cup. The forked well enables the clothespin prothesis to slide down over the stapes superstructure, between the facial nerve canal and the promontory, to form a stable, mortise-and-tenon prosthesis-stapedial joint. Joint stability is enhanced because the inferior tine of the forked well is able to lever against the inferior surface of the stapes superstructure, creating a counterforce to gravity. This is in contrast to the more unstable ball-and-socket joint created by most partial ossicular replacement prostheses when they articulate with the stapes capitulum. The addition of a flexible disk to the shaft tip produces a tight, stable union between the prosthesis and the ossicular cap by increasing resistance at the shaft-ossicle interface. Fluoroplastic composition maximizes intraoperative versatility and reliability while the ossicle cap minimizes extrusions. One-year hearing results for twelve chronic ear patients with mobile stapes undergoing clothespin ossiculoplasty during intact canal wall tympanomostoidectomy revealed postoperative air-bone gaps within 20 dB in 92% of cases. The mean postoperative air-bone gap was 8.9 dB, and the mean improvement in air-bone gap was 14.4 dB. These results are attributable to greater prosthesis stability provided by the time-tested mortise-and-tenon joint concept rather than a ball-and-socket joint in a reconstructive situation in which stability is critical.

AB  - Objective:We compared the sound transmission using different types of total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORP); we then studied the performance of a new TORP that we designed inspired by the columella, the single ossicle found in birds.Methods:Stapedial vibrations were measured on nine freshly frozen human temporal bones with laser Doppler vibrometry. We then compared the performances of eight common TORP positions or designs as well as the new silver prototype of bird-type prosthesis, designed also according to our digital holography patterns of the human tympanic membrane (TM).Results:The TORPs placed in lateral contact with both the TM and the malleus handle outperformed, at most frequencies, those placed only in contact with the TM.The new bird-type prosthesis performed equally well or better than all other prostheses.Conclusion:If the malleus handle can be retained when placing a TORP, the best sound transmission can be achieved by placing the TORP in contact with both the distal part of the malleus handle and the TM. The good performance of our bird-type prosthesis suggests that there is still room for future improvement of prosthesis design to further optimize hearing outcomes after surgery.

AB  - Polymers modified with bioactive nanoparticles are a promising solution for patients who need a tissue replacement. Modern implants, thanks to bioactive and bactericidal functions, facilitate the healing and regeneration process of the replaced tissue. The aim of this study was to assess whether silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) could support antibacterial function without cytotoxic effect and deterioration of biostability. This article describes biological and physiochemical aspects concerning a new polymeric middle ear implant (Otoimplant) enriched with silver nanoparticles. This kind of prosthesis is a promising implant for the reconstruction of ossicles in ossiculoplasty. We found that incorporation of silver nanoparticles into a polymeric matrix resulted in bactericidal efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, both resistant to antibiotics and basic strains. Our prostheses do not show cytotoxic effect and are a suitable biomaterial platform for effective culture of Saos2 and NHOst osteoblastic cells. The in vitro incubation of the samples in distilled water revealed that surface parameters, such as roughness, may slightly increase as a result of unveiling nanoparticles. However, the prolonged immersion does not change mechanical parameters. During one-year incubation, the prosthesis proved to retain stable values of Young's modulus, tensile strength, propagation of longitudinal ultrasonic waves, pH, and conductivity.

AB  - Hypothesis:A total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) with a silicone coated ball and socket joint (BSJ) is able to compensate pressure changes and therefore provide better sound transmission compared with rigid prostheses.Background:Dislocation and extrusion are known complications after TORP reconstruction, leading to revisions and recurrent hearing loss. Poor aeration of the middle ear, scar tension, and static pressure variations in conjunction with rigid prosthesis design causes high tension at the implant coupling points.Methods:A novel TORP prototype with a silicone coated BSJ has been developed. Experimental measurements were performed on nine fresh cadaveric human temporal bones of which five were used for a comparison between rigid TORP and flexible TORP tympanoplasty. The middle ear transfer function was measured at ambient pressure and at 2.5kPa, both positive and negative pressure, applied in the ear canal.Results:The flexible TORP design yields a better transmission of sound after implantation and at negative pressure inside the tympanic cavity, compared with rigid TORP. In average, it provides an equivalent sound transfer like the intact middle ear. At positive pressure, the flexible TORP performs slightly worse. Both performed worse than the intact middle ear, which is related to an uplifting of the prostheses.Conclusion:The findings may be considered preliminary as this experimental study was limited to just one of the many different possible situations of tympanoplasty and it involved a small sample size. Nevertheless, the results with the flexible TORP were promising and could encourage further investigations on such prostheses.

AB  - Microtia leads to a severe functional and aesthetic handicap. Traditionally, the auricle is often reconstructed with cartilage transplants, which is, however, associated with some partially substantial disadvantages. The authors have instead used implants of porous polyethylene for successful ear reconstruction for years, thus, avoiding some of these disadvantages. A significant benefit for the patient is achieved by simultaneous hearing rehabilitation by the implantation of active middle ear prostheses.
   The authors present their surgical concept which allows functional and aesthetic rehabilitation of microtia in children and adolescents in a single operation. In the respective patient collective, audiometric measurements in quiet and noisy environments were conducted pre- and postoperatively, and health-related quality of life was determined using a validated questionnaire.
   All patients experienced a substantial hearing gain both in quiet and noisy environments. The evaluation of health-related quality of life showed a significant benefit from the intervention.
   Functional and aesthetic rehabilitation of microtia with active middle ear implants and ear reconstruction using porous polyethylene leads to good and reliable long-term results and can increase the health-related quality of life of affected children and adolescents. The main advantage of this concept is the possibility of a single procedure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the quality of perceived sound in relation to the audiometric result after stapedotomy.
   STUDY DESIGN: Ninety-eight patients with otosclerosis, who underwent stapedotomy between 2004 and 2005, participated in this retrospective study. Audiometric data were obtained before and after stapedotomy. Patients filled out two questionnaires: the Amsterdam Post Operative Sound Evaluation and the Operation Benefit Profile, which is based on the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile.
   RESULTS: There were 83 responders and 15 nonresponders; 83% indicated that their hearing was now better compared to preoperatively. The sounds that gave the highest percentage of distortion were "high pitched sound" (15%) and "loud sound" (13%). The groups with an air-bone gap of 0 to 10 dB and 10 to 20 dB report a relatively high number of patients who experience distortion. The audiometric data correlate well with the Operation Benefit Score.
   CONCLUSIONS: Audiometric improvement does not necessarily mean an improvement in perceived sound and vice versa. But the audiometric outcome is significantly related to the patient's experienced handicap, benefit of the operation, residual difficulty, and overall satisfaction.

   Setting Tertiary referral center.
   Patients A total of five patients (two women, three men; mean age, 66 yr) were eligible for evaluation after an average follow-up period of 5.1 years after TORP-vibroplasty.
   Interventions Implantation of an active middle ear device in conjunction with a titanium coupler for oval window placement in patients with chronic middle ear disease with missing stapes suprastructure.
   Main Outcome Measures Audiometric outcomes and satisfaction of the patients.
   Results The functional gain was 45.2 and 45.6 dB HL at 6 months and 5.1 years after implantation, respectively. The speech recognition using the Freiburg monosyllabic word test and speech intelligibility showed postoperatively a distinct improvement and revealed no statistically significant change across time for the entire follow-up period. According to the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids questionnaire, the patients stated considerable subjective benefits and satisfaction with the device.
   Conclusion The good outcomes of TORP-vibroplasty in chronic disabled ears are stable. They provide long-term and long-lasting satisfying audiologic results combined with a high satisfaction of the patient. Prerequisite is the stable attachment to the cochlear windows.

   Study Design: Prospective multicenter study.
   Setting: The study was performed at 3 university hospitals in Europe (Germany, The Netherlands, and Switzerland).
   Patients: Fifteen patients with severe-to-profound mixed hearing loss because of otosclerosis or previous failed stapes surgery.
   Intervention: Implantation with a Codacs direct acoustic cochlear implant investigational device (ID) combined with a stapedotomy with a conventional stapes prosthesis
   Main Outcome Measures: Preoperative and postoperative (3 months after activation of the investigational direct acoustic cochlear implant) audiometric evaluation measuring conventional pure tone and speech audiometry, tympanometry, aided thresholds in sound field and hearing difficulty by the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit questionnaire.
   Results: The preoperative and postoperative air and bone conduction thresholds did not change significantly by the implantation with the investigational Direct Acoustic Cochlear Implant. The mean sound field thresholds (0.25-8 kHz) improved significantly by 48 dB. The word recognition scores (WRS) at 50, 65, and 80 dB SPL improved significantly by 30.4%, 75%, and 78.2%, respectively, after implantation with the investigational direct acoustic cochlear implant compared with the preoperative unaided condition. The difficulty in hearing, measured by the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit, decreased by 27% after implantation with the investigational direct acoustic cochlear implant.
   Conclusion: Patients with moderate-to-severe mixed hearing loss because of otosclerosis can benefit substantially using the Codacs investigational device.

AB  - Background In otosurgical training, cadaveric temporal bones are primarily used to provide a realistic tactile experience. However, using cadaveric temporal bones is challenging due to their limited availability, high cost, and potential for infection. Utilizing current three-dimensional (3D) technologies could overcome the limitations associated with cadaveric bones. This study focused on how a 3D-printed middle ear model can be used in otosurgical training.Methods A cadaveric temporal bone was imaged using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) to generate a 3D model of the middle ear. The final model was printed from transparent photopolymers using a laser-based 3D printer (vat photopolymerization), yielding a 3D-printed phantom of the external ear canal and middle ear. The feasibility of this phantom for otosurgical training was evaluated through an ossiculoplasty simulation involving ten otosurgeons and ten otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) residents. The participants were tasked with drilling, scooping, and placing a 3D-printed partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP). Following the simulation, a questionnaire was used to collect the participants' opinions and feedback.Results A transparent photopolymer was deemed suitable for both the middle ear phantom and PORP. The printing procedure was precise, and the anatomical landmarks were recognizable. Based on the evaluations, the phantom had realistic maneuverability, although the haptic feedback during drilling and scooping received some criticism from ORL-HNS residents. Both otosurgeons and ORL-HNS residents were optimistic about the application of these 3D-printed models as training tools.Conclusions The 3D-printed middle ear phantom and PORP used in this study can be used for low-threshold training in the future. The integration of 3D-printed models in conventional otosurgical training holds significant promise.

AB  - The main goal of the present study is to analyze and characterize the behavior of the middle ear, when a total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) is used in the ossicular chain, in order to troubleshoot conductive hearing loss. Using a finite element model (FEM), a dynamic study of the middle ear was made. The displacement values were obtained at the umbo and stapes footplate, for a sound pressure level of 80 dB sound pressure level (SPL) applied at the tympanic membrane, when a cartilage in membrane-prosthesis interface of different diameters and thicknesses was used. The results were compared with the healthy middle ear model. The usage of this model aims to achieve a set of techniques that promotes the best possible performance of prosthesis in the middle ear. The present study allows to conclude that the rehabilitation of the middle ear with TORP can lead to the best results when used with 4 mm diameter cartilages, with a thin thickness of 0.3 mm.

AB  - This study investigates the test-retest distributions and the interval for true score change of the (modified) Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap [(m)AIAD], when the latter is used to measure the effect of an intervention. In a previous study the reliability and validity of the (m)AIAD in a cohort of hearing impaired patients were found to have satisfactory high values. In this prospective study, 66 patients underwent a tympanoplasty operation. Preoperatively and postoperatively pure tone audiometry was performed, and at the same time the subjective hearing ability was established by means of the (m)AIAD. The correlation between threshold change and score change was 0.35 (Pearson's r). Scores on the (m)AIAD had to change by at least 16 to be qualified as a true change. For only nine of 66 subjects this criterion was fulfilled. No clear relation exists, except for these nine subjects, between threshold change and score change in this patient population. The study also shows that disability questionnaires have their limitations, when using them to measure the result of a medical intervention in an individual patient.

AB  - The first hearing results with a new stapes prosthesis with clip function (Soft-CliPA (R) piston) are presented.
   This new prosthesis was used in 15 patients (mean age 45.2 years; range 21-63 years) undergoing routine stapes surgery. Soft-CliPA (R) piston prostheses with a shaft diameter of 0.4 mm and a length ranging from 4.25 mm to 5.5 mm were used. Postoperative audiological testing and measurement of the air-bone gap were performed after an average of 47.3 days and compared with the preoperative values.
   The median observed postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 8.33 dB +/- 4.16 dB. All patients had less than 20 dB ABG and in 53.3% of cases was less than 10 dB. The operating time showed a clear difference between the left (66.5 min +/- 37.79 min) and right ears (47.2 min +/- 11.08 min).
   This new prosthesis design greatly facilitates a very difficult step in stapes surgery, the prosthesis fixation to the incus. The first postoperative hearing results are very promising but long-term results in a larger group of patients are still pending.

AB  - Objectives: This clinical study was performed to retrospectively analyze the hearing improvement of patients with otosclerosis who underwent stapesplasty with a novel nitinol prosthesis in comparison with the use of already established prostheses (titanium and clip prostheses) and to evaluate the suitability of the nitinol prosthesis for ear surgeons with limited experience in otosclerosis surgery.
   Study Design: Retrospective data analysis.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: Sixty patients who underwent otosclerosis surgery between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2012, in the ENT department of the University of Munich. Two patients were operated on both sides. For four patients, the stapesplasty was a revision surgery.
   Interventions: Sixty-two procedures of otosclerosis surgery were performed by 6 ear surgeons, one of whom with profound experience in stapesplasty.
   Main Outcome Measures: 1) Postoperative air-bone gap, determined for all surgeons together as well as itemized for the experienced and the nonexperienced stapes surgeons; 2) closure of the air-bone gap in 10 dB bins; and 3) change of high-tone bone-conduction level.
   Results: Pure-tone audiometry documented less postoperative air-bone gap and a higher percentage of air-bone gap closure when using the nitinol prosthesis, especially in comparison with the clip prosthesis. Also, nonexperienced stapes surgeons received better audiometric results when using the novel nitinol prosthesis.
   Conclusions: Clinical evaluation suggests the novel nitinol prosthesis to be a promising tool in otosclerosis surgery for experienced stapes surgeons as well as for ear surgeons with limited experience in stapes surgery.

AB  - Objectives/HypothesisTo review surgical findings and hearing outcomes of incus footplate assembly (IFA) for the patients with conductive hearing loss due to missing stapes superstructure with a mobile stapes footplate.
   Study DesignRetrospective case review and survey.
   MethodsPre- and postoperative audiometric data and intraoperative findings were reviewed. Postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) and ABG closure (postoperative air-conduction threshold-preoperative bone-conduction threshold) were analyzed.
   ResultsThe causes of missing stapes superstructure and conductive hearing loss were congenital ossicular anomaly (n = 5), chronic otitis media (n = 2), and congenital cholesteatoma (n = 1). The prosthesis was designed to fit between the medial side of the incus and stapes footplate and had a mean length of 3.6 0.5 mm. The mean pre- and postoperative ABG were 38.3 4.8 and 13.3 +/- 10.0 dB, respectively. The postoperative ABG at frequencies of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 kHz were 20.0 +/- 15.4, 16.9 +/- 11.9, 16.3 +/- 10.3, 10.6 +/- 7.3, 12.9 +/- 14.0, and 23.1 +/- 16.2 dB, respectively. The mean ABG closure was 9.5 dB (range, -1.3 approximate to 35.8 dB). Seven cases obtained the best results (mean ABG closure 10 dB). In the remaining patient, the mean ABG closure was 9.5 dB until 6 months after surgery, but was 35.8 dB 1 year after surgery.
   ConclusionsIFA seems to be a reasonable surgical option in patients with missing the stapes superstructure, but with a mobile footplate in which the long process of incus is preserved.

AB  - ObjectivesAlthough various stapedotomy and stapedectomy techniques exist, anchoring the piston can be challenging. We present a novel surgical approach for treating congenital stapes malformations with an atypical facial nerve trajectory.MethodsThis is a case of a 7-year-old boy presenting with bilateral conductive hearing loss. Prior attempts at tympanoplasty had proven unsuccessful in improving his hearing. Presurgical imaging studies revealed an unusual anatomical configuration, with the facial nerve positioned inferior to the oval window. This anatomical variation precluded the use of conventional prosthesis-anchoring techniques typically employed in stapedotomies. Thus, we devised an innovative approach, opting to anchor the prosthesis to the short process of the incus.ResultsThis novel technique circumvented the atypical course of the facial nerve, allowing for successful reconstruction of the ossicular chain. The patient demonstrated an acceptable improvement (30 dB gain) in hearing 1-year post-surgery, with no reported complications.ConclusionThis case underscores the critical importance of adapting surgical techniques to address the unique anatomical challenges that may arise in the context of congenital ear malformations. It also highlights the potential of the short process of the incus as a viable alternative anchoring site for stapes prostheses, thereby improving the outcomes of such complex cases. This technique not only restored the patient's hearing but also contributed valuable insights into the management of similar cases, potentially improving the quality of life for individuals with rare and challenging anatomical variations.Level of evidence5.

AB  - A long-term, retrospective, non-controlled study was performed on the drainage results of mastoidectomy (both radical and modified radical) and the relevant statistical factors that could influence the anatomic outcome were defined. The present study took into consideration the same cohort of 200 patients we have communicated with before in our previous studies concerning the long-term functional results of mastoidectomy and long-term results of ossicular replacement with biovitroceramic prosthesis. The patients were clinically followed for the same period of 8.12 years. The drainage (anatomic) results, similar to previously published functional results, were defined by analytical function of the severity and the period of evolution of disease. The main goal was to define the situations and factors (presence of complications, type of disease, type of tympanic perforation or status of ossicular chain) that influenced the drainage results that could provide us with some type of anatomical prognosis. The follow-up started at the moment of complete epithelization for each cavity as time represents the main study comparison criteria. Drainage failure was assessed by the number of otorrhea episodes. It was concluded that practically and ideally, a maximum of 84% of the mastoid and petrous cells can be cleaned out. The results of 78% drainage success are congruent to this theory. The remaining 16% of cells may contain irreversible lesions.

AB  - Objective: Surgery can often eradicate chronic middle ear disease in patients with recurrent cholesteatoma, tubal dysfunction, and others; however, in many cases, social hearing cannot be restored even after multiple revision tympanoplasties. A hearing aid is then recommended. Placement of an implantable hearing aid with its advantage of an unoccluded ear canal, irrespective of middle ear function, seems to be a promising alternative.
   Study Design: After establishing the biomechanics of the ear in our temporal bone laboratory, various locations and attachments of a Vibrant transducer were investigated. These experiments resulted in the development of a new titanium clip holder for a Vibrant integrated total ossicular replacement prosthesis assembly with placement on the footplate. Four patients with permanent severe combined hearing loss were implanted with this device after multiple revision tympanoplasties. The first case is described in detail.
   Results: Placing a transducer directly on the footplate via a rod transmission gave a better gain for the high frequencies than in the round window location. The acoustic results of the patients showed an improved gain in speech understanding, unobtainable by a conventional heating aid.
   Conclusion: The concept of a total ossicular replacement prosthesis-vibroplasty establishes a straightforward procedure in the tympanic cavity similar to a normal tympanoplasty. The open ear canal and its superior acoustic performance offer a promising perspective for revision operations in cases of incurable middle car dysfunction.

AB  - Bioactive glasses were invented 45 years ago and have been in clinical use since the 1980s in otology, orthopaedics and dentistry. Initially born as bioactive materials to fill bone defects, bioactive glasses expanded their biomedical suitability towards a broad spectrum of tissue engineering and therapeutic applications, and research evolution seems to witness that their potential is far from being fully exploited. Classical applications of bioactive glasses involve bone filling materials and dental implants; however, the fascinating question to be answered in the next few years is: how can bioactive glasses be useful in soft tissue regeneration and to treat diseases, such as tumours, that may affect internal organs? This review paper focuses on research that demonstrates the suitability of bioactive glasses in contact with tissues outside the skeletal system, including muscle and nerve tissue regeneration, treatment of diseases affecting sense organs (eye and ear), embolization of neoplastic tissues, cancer radiotherapy via injectable microspheres, and wound dressing. A prospect for future research is also provided, highlighting the potential associated to targeted therapy via local ion release, angiogenesis stimulation and in situ drug release, as well as the promise of biofabrication for the development of bioactive glass-containing composite constructs for organ regeneration.

AB  - Introduction: This study reviews the cases of stapedotomy and evaluates its effectiveness at improving hearing loss in patients with otosclerosis.
   Materials and methods: Retrospective review of patients' records who had clinical and audiometric diagnosis of otosclerosis from January to December 2012
   Results: A total of 54 stapedotomy surgeries (52 unilateral and 1 bilateral surgeries) were received. Average post- operative ABG for 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 KHz showed that 61.1% had complete closure of ABG (ABG < 10 dB) compared with 1.6% preoperatively and 85.2% had closure of ABG to within 20dB compared with 4.7% preoperatively (t = 13.89, p = 0.000). More than 94% had hearing improvement and 81.5% had ABG closure greater than 10 dB postoperatively (mean gain 23.38 +/- 12.37, t = 13.89, p = 0.000). A total of 13% complications were recorded with TM perforation (5.6%) being the commonest complication.
   Conclusion: Stapedotomy is an effective surgical procedure for the treatment of otosclerosis which leads to improvement in patients' quality of life. A favorable hearing outcome can be obtained by the combination of experienced hands with minimal surgical trauma and appropriate surgical technique.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a direct acoustic cochlear implant (DACI) for speech understanding in noise in patients suffering from severe to profound mixed hearing loss (MHL) due to various etiologies compared to the preoperative best-aided condition. The study was performed at five tertiary referral centers in Europe (Belgium, Germany, Poland and Spain). Nineteen adult subjects with severe to profound MHL due to (advanced) otosclerosis, ear canal fibrosis, chronic otitis media, tympanosclerosis or previous cholesteatoma were implanted with a DACI (Codacs (TM) Investigational Device) combined with a conventional stapes prosthesis. Unaided and aided speech reception scores in quiet and in noise, preoperative and postoperative air and bone conduction thresholds and aided and unaided sound field thresholds were measured prospectively during the study. Subjective benefit analysis was determined through the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit questionnaire. Quality of life was measured by the Health Utilities Index. All subjects were fitted preoperatively with hearing aids and/or a bone conduction implant on a headband before DACI implantation. This allows direct comparison between different hearing rehabilitation solutions. The mean speech reception threshold in noise improved significantly by 7.9 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after activation of the DACI compared to the preoperative best-aided condition. For all 19 subjects, a mean postoperative aided speech reception threshold of 2.6 dB SNR (standard deviation: 8.3 dB) was measured. On average, no significant shift in the bone conduction thresholds was noted 4-5 months after implantation. A mean sound field threshold improvement of 46 and 16 dB was measured compared to the preoperative unaided and best-aided condition, respectively. Speech perception tests in quiet showed a mean improvement of the word recognition scores by 65 and 48% at 65 dB SPL compared to the preoperative unaided and best-aided condition, respectively. In summary, DACI provides an effective improvement of the speech perception in noise compared to the best-aided condition in subjects suffering from severe to profound MHL. (C) 2014 S.

AB  - Chronic inflammation can irreversibly damage components of the ossicular chain which may lead to sound conduction deafness. The replacement of impaired ossicles with prostheses does not reduce the risk of bacterial infections which may lead to loss of function of the implant and consequently to additional damage of the connected structures such as inner ear, meninges and brain. Therefore, implants that could do both, reconstruct the sound conduction and in addition provide antibacterial protection are of high interest for ear surgery. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are promising novel biomaterials that have previously been used as an antibiotic-releasing implant coating to curb bacterial infections in the middle ear. However, animal studies of LDHs are scarce and there exist only few additional data on the biocompatibility and hardly any on the biodegradation of these compounds. In this study, middle ear prostheses were coated with an LDH compound, using suspensions of nanoparticles of an LDH containing Mg and Al as well as carbonate ions. These coatings were characterized and implanted into the middle ear of healthy rabbits for 10 days. Analysis of the explanted prostheses showed only little signs of degradation. A stable health constitution was observed throughout the whole experiment in every animal. The results show that LDH-based implant coatings are biocompatible and dissolve only slowly in the middle ear. They, therefore, appear as promising materials for the construction of controlled drug delivery vehicles.

AB  - In this tutorial review we present the process of the development of functional implants using mesoporous silica. The different steps from chemical synthesis and physicochemical characterization followed by in vitro testing in cell culture assays to clinically relevant in vivo animal studies are examined. Since the end of the 1990s, mesoporous silicas have been considered as biomaterials. Numerous investigations have demonstrated their non-toxic and biocompatible properties. These qualities in combination with the unique properties of high surface area and pore volume, uniform and tunable pore sizes and chemical modifiability are the reasons for the great scientific interest in this field. Here we show that besides bulk materials or mesoporous silica nanoparticles, mesoporous silica films are highly promising as coatings on medical prostheses or implants. We report on the development of functionalized mesoporous silica materials specifically for middle ear applications. Middle ear prostheses are used to restore the sound transmission through this air-filled cavity when the small bones of the middle air (the ossicular chain) have been destroyed by disease or by accidents. In addition to optimal restoration of sound transmission, this technique bears several challenges, e. g. an ongoing bacterial infection or the displacement of the prosthesis due to insufficient fixation. To improve the healing process, a mesoporous silica coating was established on ceramic middle ear prostheses, which then served as a base for further functionalizations. For example, the bone growth factor BMP2 was locally attached to the coating in order to improve the fixation of the prosthesis by forming a bony connection to the remainder of the ear bones. Further, an implant-based local drug delivery system for the antibiotic ciprofloxacin was developed with the aim of fighting bacterial infections. Further possibilities using mesoporous silica nanoparticles as part of a composite on an implant are briefly discussed.

AB  - Objective: Evaluation of the long-term safety and performance of an active middle ear implant (AMEI) in the treatment of hearing loss in children and adolescents with a primary focus on improvement in speech discrimination. Study Design: Prospective, multicentric, single-subject repeated-measures design in which each subject serves as his or her own control. Subjects: Thirty-one pediatric subjects aged 5 to 17 years. Intervention: Implantation of an active middle ear implant. Methods: Improvement in word recognition scores, speech reception thresholds (SRT) in quiet and noise, in addition to air conduction, bone conduction, and sound field thresholds were evaluated in two age groups. Results: Residual hearing did not change over time and speech intelligibility significantly improved and remained stable after 36 months. Children aged 5 to 9 improved in WRS from 21.92 to 95.38% and in SRT in quiet and in noise respectively from 62.45 dB SPL (sound pressure level) and +1.14 dB SNR to 42.07 dB SPL and -4.45 dB SNR. Adolescents aged 10 to 17 improved in WRS from 12.78 to 84.71% and in SRT in quiet and in noise respectively from 63.96 dB SPL and +3.32 dB SNR to 35.31 dB SPL and -4.55 dB SNR. Conclusions: The AMEI, under investigation, is a safe treatment for children and adolescents, and significantly improved audiological performance that remains stable on the long-term scale (up to 36 mo postimplantation). In general, all adult-related issues and questions regarding safety and performance can also be applied to the pediatric population, as no apparent specific issues developed.

AB  - Objective To assess quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes after modified subtotal petrosectomy with ear canal closure (mSTP) for chronic otitis media. Study Design Survey study. Setting Tertiary referral center. Patients Patients with chronic otitis media. Interventions mSTP. Main Outcome Measures Survey results from enrolled patients on the validated disease-specific Chronic Ear Survey (CES) and Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test-15 (COMOT-15) regarding their current state of health and, if surgery was performed within 3 years of enrollment, their state of health before mSTP. Results A total of 23 patients were studied, including 19 who underwent surgery within 3 years of enrollment. Postoperatively, mean total CES scores were 80 and COMOT-15 scores were 41, with a higher CES and a lower COMOT-15 indicating better QoL. There were statistically significant improvements after mSTP in the CES activity restriction (25% difference; p = 0.008), symptom (17% difference; p = 0.007), and medical resource (13% difference; p = 0.03) domain and total (18% difference; p = 0.006) scores. In addition, there were statistically significant improvements in the COMOT-15 ear symptom (-22% difference; p < 0.001) domain and total (-16% difference; p = 0.01) scores; however, improvements in the hearing function and mental health domains did not achieve statistical significance. Postoperative COMOT-15 total scores were significantly better for patients who underwent aural rehabilitation compared to those who did not (-17% difference; p < 0.001). Conclusion Modified subtotal petrosectomy with ear canal closure is a useful intervention for patients with recalcitrant chronic otitis media, offering improved QoL in appropriately selected patients. Aural rehabilitation, when feasible, provides the potential for further QoL improvement.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the quality of life (QoL) and hearing thresholds of patients who underwent 2 types of stapes surgery. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was performed comparing stapedotomy with NiTiBOND prostheses (n = 20) and stapedectomy with autogenous cortical bone columella (n = 20), applying the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults outcome measures with hearing thresholds. Univariate comparative statistical methods were applied. RESULTS: The stapedotomy cohort had significantly better values of Social Support Score of the GBI as compared to the stapedectomy cohort ( P = .016). No statistically significant difference was detected between the groups in the pre- and postoperative audiological results and the further QoL measures. CONCLUSION: Apart from the excellent postoperative audiological results of the different types of stapes surgeries, stapedotomy with NiTiBOND prostheses seems to be superior as regards QoL over stapedectomy applying autogenous cortical bone columella.

   Material and methods: The state of the tissues in the implanted area, as well as audiological and quality of life results were analyzed at six, nine and twelve months after implantation in a group of four adult patients with bilateral mixed hearing loss (1 after bilateral canal-wall-down mastoidectomy, 2 with chronic simple otitis media and after myringoplasty in the opposite ear, 1 with bilateral otosclerosis and after stapedotomy in the opposite ear).
   Results: No postoperative complications were found in any of the cases. One year after surgery the mean audiological gain in FF PTA4 (pure tone average for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) was 52.2 +/- 3.5 dB in comparison to the unaided situation, the mean speech understanding with Osia (R) in quiet was 90 +/- 8.2% for 50 dB SPL, 98.8 +/- 2.5% for 65 dB SPL and 100 +/- 0% for 80 dB SPL, and the mean speech understanding with Osia (R) in noise was 37.5% +/- 23.6 for 50 dB SPL, 93.8 +/- 4.8% for 65 dB SPL and 98.8 +/- 2.5% for 80 dB SPL. There was also an evident improvement in the quality of hearing as well as in the quality of life, measured by APHAB (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit) and SSQ (Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale).
   Conclusions: The Osia (R) is an effective treatment option for patients with bilateral mixed hearing loss. The mid-term audiological and quality of life results are excellent, but further observations including bigger groups of patients and a longer follow-up are required.

AB  - Direct ear trauma through external auditory canal causing an avulsion injury of malleoincudal complex is a grievous injury that can happen during ear cleaning with indigenous ear hook. One such case of avulsion injury is presented here with its symptomatology, investigation, and management with the review of available literature because of its rarity. Various locally designed indigenous ear hooks are available in street side markets and even online for purchase and used by many without knowing its ill effects on health. Injury caused by these types of hooks may lead to a severe hearing disability, if not properly treated. This presentation is to highlight the fact that indigenous ear hooks; rampantly available online for purchase can cause a potentially major injury leading to hearing disability and thereafter poor quality of life. Reporting and highlighting of such incidents among the ENT community can help increase the public awareness; thereby, eliminating such disastrous consequences. Wikipedia, PubMed, and Google search engine has been used for our data collection and analysis.

AB  - This systematic review aims to (a) define what instruments are available to measure quality of life (QoL) in patients undergoing tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media (COM) and what is the most commonly selected timing to do so; (b) compare outcomes from different surgical techniques; and (c) describe any reported correlation between subjective and functional results. This review was conducted following the PRISMA statement recommendations. Of the 151 articles screened, 24 were included. Most studies had a prospective design. The mean age at surgery was 44.5 years. A microscopic retroauricular approach was the most common surgical technique. Most articles included both primary and revision surgeries. The most commonly used questionnaire was the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), followed by the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), the Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15) and the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21). Questionnaires were administered about 12 months after surgery in most studies. Ten studies reported possible associations between hearing results and QoL. QoL assessment after COM surgery variably relies on disease-specific and non-specific questionnaires. Patients are usually evaluated 12 months after surgery, and this appears to be a suitable timing to contrast the possible bias effect of different tympanoplasty techniques associated with different healing times. A comparison between QoL outcomes in different surgical approaches cannot be made, as several influencing factors have not been detailed in the included studies. Few studies have investigated the correlation between subjective and objective outcomes of tympanoplasty for COM so far.

AB  - The evaluation of results after middle ear reconstruction has been mainly based on functional parameters. In clinical practice as well as in otological research, the pure tone audiogram represents the gold standard in the assessment of the postoperative outcome. In order to assess the patient's subjective outcome, outcome analyzes focus increasingly on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL). However, the evaluation of HRQOL requires reliable and validated measuring instruments. A modest number of validated questionnaires for determination of the disease-specific HRQOL in patients with chronic otitis media and/or conductive hearing loss are currently available. Three of seven available questionnaires were developed and validated in the German-speaking countries, the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory 21 (ZCMEI-21), the Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15) and the Stapesplasty Outcome Test 25 (SPOT-25). In this review, all seven available disease-specific measuring instruments as well as the generic questionnaires, which were used in previous clinical trials, are explained and current findings of quality-of-life research in patients with chronic otitis media and/or conductive hearing loss are presented.u

AB  - Objective: To prospectively analyze short-term (3 mo) results in patients with otosclerosis who underwent stapedotomy with the newly designed NiTiBOND prosthesis and compare them with patients that underwent SMart piston stapedotomy. We aimed to assess "noninferiority" for the new prosthesis.
   Study Design: Prospective controlled trial.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: Thirty-eight patients were included in the NiTiBOND group (41 ears), and 74 patients were included in the SMart Piston group (75 ears).
   Intervention(s): Stapedotomy.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Pure-tone audiometry 3 months after surgery, intraoperative prosthesis handling as assessed using a questionnaire, and complications were analyzed.
   Results: Pure-tone audiometry showed postoperative air-bone gap means (standard deviation) of 8.1 (8.3) and 9.9 (5.4) dB; air-bone gap closure within 10 dB was achieved in 71% and 72% and within 20 dB in 93% and 96% for the NiTiBOND and the SMart piston prosthesis, respectively. Noninferiority was shown at all frequencies and in the pure-tone average. The NiTiBOND prosthesis provides excellent intraoperative handling, and no adverse reactions were reported.

AB  - For patients with a totally empty middle ear a total alloplastic middle ear prosthesis (TAM) has been developed consisting of a macroporous hydroxyapatite canal-wall segment as a foundation system from which a dense hydroxyapatite ossicular chain is suspended.  To connect the ossicular chain, we developed an alloplastic tympanic membrane made from a polymer.
   Light microscopy, morphometry, and autoradiography as well as various electron microscopy techniques were used in this study to evaluate the biocompatibility of Polyactive(R), a polyether polyester copolymer, after implantation in the rat middle ear.
   After between 2 and 4 weeks, implants were completely covered by tympanic-membrane epidermis and epithelium.  Polyactive provoked a mild foreign-body reaction, showed a degradation rate of 54 percent after 1 year, and was nontoxic.  Growth of fibrous tissue and bone into Polyactive copolymer indicated appropriate implant fixation by mechanical interlocking.  The fixation of Polyactive by ingrowth of bone is promising, not only in terms of the amount of bone but also in terms of the bone/polymer interface.  The latter is indicative of bonding osteogenesis in a way similar to that reported for hydroxyapatite implants.
   The results of this study showed that Polyactive copolymer is suitable as a degradable alloplastic tympanic membrane, both as a temporary scaffolding for the repair of tympanic membrane perforations and as a tympanic membrane in the TAM.

AB  - Objectives: Congenital cholesteatoma (CC) is accompanied by hearing loss and an intact tympanic membrane. However, the hearing loss is usually associated with otitis media, and the diagnosis of CC is frequently delayed in patients with an intact tympanic membrane. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of patients with CC. Methods: We reviewed patients with cholesteatoma from January 2011 to May 2020 and selected those meeting the congenital cholesteatoma criteria. The primary outcome measures included presenting symptoms, surgical findings, stage of disease, recurrence rate and hearing outcomes. Results: We reviewed 1646 medical files of cholesteatoma patients and identified 18 patients with congenital cholesteatoma, the mean age at operation was 8.13 +/- 1.36 years (range 3-18). The unilateral hearing loss included moderate 13 patients (72.2%), severe 4 patients (22.2%), and slight 1 (5.6%). There were 14 cases of conductive hearing loss (77.8%) and 4 cases of mixed hearing loss (22.2%). The mean course of disease was 1.41 +/- 0.05 years (range 0.4-3). The surgical management was oto-endoscope exploratory tympanotomy in 1 (5.6%), canal wall up mastoidectomy in 12 (66.7%) and canal wall down in 5 (27.8%), with 17 (94.4%) ossicular replacements. Seventeen (94.4%) patients presented with Potsic stage III-IV. Recurrence occurred in 5.6% of patients in stage III and 11.1% of patients in stage IV. After surgery, patients achieved normal voice tone hearing. Conclusions: To diagnose it early, congenital cholesteatoma should be considered as a possible aetiology for hearing loss patients with an intact tympanic membrane. In our study, most patients were diagnosed at III and IV stage. This highlights the need to promote awareness of the disease among primary physicians in the community healthcare system. Surgical management with removal of the cholesteatoma and reconstruction of the tympanum and ossicular chain is an effective treatment.

AB  - Objectives: This is a qualitative study to explore the utility of gray-scale inversion or the "invert" function of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans in the diagnosis of temporal bone anatomy and pathology. Methods: This is a case series describing an innovative application of an existing image processing tool to visualize temporal bone anatomy and pathology. Illustrative patients at a tertiary referral center with otologic symptoms and findings leading to HRCT scans of the temporal bone were included. Diagnostic HRCT scans were evaluated utilizing the gray-scale inversion function (invert function). Results: Nine illustrative cases which demonstrate conditions such as persistent stapedial artery, membranous stapes footplate, total ossicular prosthesis migration into the vestibule, third window syndrome such as superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) and cochlea-facial nerve dehiscence, otosclerosis, and ossicular chain discontinuity are included. The enhanced visualization was confirmed surgically in 3 cases, and 1 had physiological confirmation using cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP). Conclusions: Gray-scale inversion can be used to improve visualization of temporal bone anatomy and pathologic changes when diagnoses are in doubt. The invert function is a useful adjunct in the armamentarium of both radiologists and otologists when evaluating HRCT of the temporal bone.

AB  - Background: The otosclerotic process may influence the performance of the cochlear implant (CI). Difficulty in inserting the electrode array due to potential ossification of the cochlea, facial nerve stimulation, and instability of the results are potential challenges for the CI team. Objectives: To evaluate hearing results and subjective outcomes of CI users with otosclerosis and to compare them with those of CI users without otosclerosis. Method: Retrospective review of 239 adults with bilateral profound postlingual deafness who underwent unilateral cochlear implantation between 1992 and 2017. Hearing and speech understanding were assessed via pure-tone audiometry and speech perception tests. Subjective outcomes were assessed via the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire (NCIQ), the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), and the Hearing Implant Sound Quality Index (HISQUI(19)) at 6 months, 12 months, and at the last follow-up. Results: Subjects were 22 CI users with otosclerosis and 217 without otosclerosis. Both groups had a similar duration of deafness and age at CI implantation. Results did not significantly differ according to group: no significant intergroup difference was found regarding the frequency of complete electrode insertion, facial stimulation, reimplantation, or PTA4 scores at the last follow-up. Regarding speech perception, no significant intergroup difference was found on any test or at any interval. Further, subjective outcomes, as measured by the GBI, NCIQ, and HISQUI(19), did not significantly differ between groups. Conclusions: Adults with otosclerosis and profound hearing loss derive significant benefit from CI use. Audiological and self-reported outcomes are not significantly different from that of other CI users with postlingual deafness. (C) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Objective. To evaluate the inner ear effects of canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty in the treatment of chronic otitis media (COM) with regard to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and reported tinnitus and dizziness-related disability.
   Setting. Tertiary care academic medical center.
   Subjects and Methods. Prospective study of 86 patients treated by CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty for COM with or without cholesteatoma. Standard patient workup included preoperative audiogram and completion of 2 surveys: Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). Patients underwent repeat audiogram, DHI, and THI surveys at 4 to 6 months postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative data were analyzed.
   Results. No significant SNHL occurred after CWD mastoidectomy. Thirteen patients (13/34 [38%]) had DHI improvement greater than 18 points, indicating a significant improvement in dizziness-related disability. Three patients developed new-onset postoperative dizziness complaints. Twenty patients (20/43 [46.5%]) had THI improvement greater than 7 points, indicating a significant improvement in tinnitus-related disability. Five patients developed new-onset postoperative tinnitus complaints. The odds ratio for improving DHI and THI scores after surgery was 6.6 (1.8 to 25.0) and 4.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.45% to 12.2%), respectively.
   Conclusion. In this study, CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty in the treatment of COM did not cause significant SNHL. In addition, using the DHI and THI measures, patient-perceived disability from dizziness and tinnitus, respectively, was shown to decrease after mastoid surgery.

AB  - This study is aimed to assess the outcome of Type-1Tympanoplasty in patients of Chronic Otitis Media (COM)- mucosal type and document the associated hearing gain and correlate it with the improvement in Quality of life (QOL) using COMOT (Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test) 15 scoring. A hospital based prospective study was carried out in a tertiary care centre on 80 patients of mucosal type of COM. Patients were given COMOT 15 questionnaire to score the symptoms and pure tone audiometry (PTA) was done to assess hearing level. All patients underwent Type 1 Tympanoplasty via post aural approach. Patients were followed up regularly at 3rd, 6th and 12th month following surgery. QOL and PTA were reassessed during follow up visits. Among the 80 patients enrolled, 58.8% were females and 41.2% were males. The pre-operative mean value with standard deviation for ear discharge is 2.70 +/- 1.02 which got reduced to 2.4 +/- 1.07 by the end of 12th month. The preoperative average hearing loss in right ear was 25.15 +/- 15.7 while in left ear it was 26.26 +/- 16.7 which got reduced to 19.5 +/- 11.01 and 20.5 +/- 11.39 respectively. There was statistically significant improvement in QOL and hearing levels of all patients who underwent tympanoplasty as seen in the various parameters of postoperative COMOT 15 scoring with a p value of 0.001. Tympanoplasty resulted in marked improvement in disease-specific QOL as well as their hearing. Hence it should be recommended to the patients with COM for improving the QOL.

AB  - Social functioning and personal satisfaction about quality of life are issues in the spotlight in most fields of otolaryngology. However, in ear surgery, few studies performed standardised measurements through interviews and validated questionnaires. We enrolled 81 patients undergoing tympanomastoidectomy from January 2011 to December 2014, at the "A. Gemelli" Hospital of the Catholic University. Rome. 50 patients (61.7%) underwent non-obliterative Canal Wall Down (CWD) mastoidectomy, whereas 31 patients (38.3%) underwent Canal Wall Up (CWU) mastoidectomy. We administered the Chronic Ear Survey (CES) 3 and 12-months post-operatively and the Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test-15 (COMOT-15) 12 months post-operatively. Results were compared to hearing threshold, sex and age. In the CWD Group, significant improvements were observed in all CES subscale scores and total scores over time (p < 0.001) whereas in the CWU Group we found a partial improvement. Inter-group comparison showed no significant differences in administration of CES in CWD vs CWU (p > 0.05 for all subsections and overall scores). A significant difference was found only in the COMOT-15 "Hearing Function" subsection, in favour of CWU over CWD (61 vs 39 respectively; p < 0.05). A significant association was found between PTA and COMOT-15 "Hearing Function" subsection scores. According to our results, a significant difference in the post-operative QoL between CWD and CWU should not be taken for granted.

AB  - Background: Injuries of the ossicular chain have various etiologies. Skull traumas from blows to the temporal, parietal or occipital region with or without fracture of the temporal bone are the main causes of the ossicular injury; other modes of injury are rare. It depends on the type of trauma which kind of injury occurs. Mainly subluxations, luxations and fractures are to be observed. The incus is the ossicle which is the most often injured. Mostly, only one ossicle is injured, rarely two or all of them.
   Patients: From January 1997 to June 1999 we operated 19 patients with traumatic lesions of the membrane and the middle ear. In 4 cases the reason for the operation was an injury of the stapes. We observed 2 cases with broken stapes crura, I case with an impression of the stapes into the vestibulum with perilymphatic fistula and 1 case with subluxation of the stapes in the direction of the promontorium. By presenting 4 cases we want to point out the diagnostic possibilities and the operative management of such rare injuries. In all cases we applied the transmeatal approach for the operation of the middle ear. In 2 cases it was possible to place the stapes back in their anatomic position in order to re-establish the ossicular chain. In the other 2 cases we had to use middle ear prostheses which were interpositioned between the manubrium of the malleus and the footplate of the stapes.
   Results: In all cases the immediate post-operative hearing results and the long-term hearing results after 10 to 28 months were satisfying. We did not notice any post-operative complications, especially no vestibular symptoms. One patient's tinnitus was the same as before the operation.
   Conclusions: The diagnosis of a stapes injury is despite the use of sophisticated technology, especially the CT-scan of the temporal bone, often very difficult. A sensitive anamnesis seems to be very important. It depends on the kind of injury which operative technique is to be applied in order to re-establish the ossicular chain. In our opinion, it is useful to take - if it is possible - the autolog stapes for the surgical re-establishment of transmission.

AB  - Background and objectives: The chronic otitis media questionnaire-12 (COMQ-12) and chronic otitis media benefit inventory (COMBI) aim to assess the quality of life related to chronic otitis media or its surgical treatment. The objective of this study was to validate the Spanish adaptation of the COMQ-12 and COMBI. Patients and methods: Multicentre prospective instrument validation study. guidelines for the cross-cultural adaptation process were followed. The psychometric properties of the Spanish versions ("COMQ-12-Spa" for "COMQ-12-Spanish" and "COMBI-Spa" for "COMBI-Spanish") were assessed in 25 consecutive adults undergoing tympanoplasty and in a separate cohort of 25 unaffected adults. Results: COMQ-12-Spa: test-retest reliability, r = 0.98; internal consistency reliability, = 0.92. Item-subscale and item-total coefficients, >= 0.40. Between-group discrimination, p < 0.0001. COMBI-Spa: internal consistency, = 0.96. A high-intensity relationship between the variables was shown, >= 0.40. Correlation between the COMBI-Spa and the Spanish Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), r = 0.89; p < 0.01. Conclusion: Psychometric testing of the Spanish versions of the COMQ-12-Spa and COMBI-Spa yielded satisfactory results, thus allowing pre-and postintervention assessment of the subjective severity of chronic otitis media in adult patients.

AB  - Background: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is frequently associated with symptoms of inflammation like discharge from the ear or pain. In many cases, patients suffer from hearing loss causing communication problems and social withdrawal. The objective of this work was to collect prospective audiological data and data on general and disease-specific quality of life with validated quality of life measurement instruments to assess the impact of the disease on health-related quality of life (HR-QOL).
   Methods: 121 patients were included in the study. Patients were clinically examined in the hospital before and 6 months after surgery including audiological testing. They filled in the quality of life questionnaires SF-36 and Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15) pre-operatively and 6 and 12 months post-operatively, respectively.
   Results: Complete data records from 90 patients were available for statistical analysis. Disease-specific HR-QOL in patients with CSOM improved after tympanoplasty in all the scales of the COMOT-15. There was no difference in HR-QOL assessment between patients with mesotympanic respectively epitympanic CSOM. However, we did find the outcome to be worse in patients who received revision surgery compared with those receiving primary surgery. Audiometric findings correlated very well with the subscale hearing function from the COMOT-15 questionnaire. General HR-QOL measured with the SF-36 was not significantly changed by tympanoplasty.
   Conclusions: Tympanoplasty did lead to a significant improvement of disease-specific HR-QOL in patients with CSOM while general HR-QOL did not change. Very well correlations were found between the subscale hearing function from the COMOT-15 questionnaire and audiological findings. Revision surgery seems to be a predictor for a worse outcome.

AB  - Otosclerosis is associated with hearing disability, leading to communication deficits and social and psychological restrictions. The objective of our study was to analyze disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after stapes surgery and compare the outcome of HRQOL with audiometric parameters.
   Our clinical case study was conducted at two tertiary referral centers. All the 37 patients who had undergone stapes surgery were analyzed clinically and by audiometric testing (pure tone and speech audiometry) in the pre- and postoperative settings. Disease-specific HRQOL was assessed by the validated Stapesplasty Outcome Test 25 (SPOT-25) pre- and postoperatively. The subjective hearing disability was evaluated by the hearing handicap inventory for adults (HHIA). The postinterventional benefit was measured by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI).
   Disease-specific HRQOL improved significantly after stapes surgery in all scales of the SPOT-25. Postoperatively, the total score and the subscore "hearing function" correlated well with the audiometric data. The subscores "tinnitus", "social restrictions", and "mental condition" did not show significant association with audiometric parameters. The comparison of pre- and postoperative HHIA offered a significant improvement in the hearing disability. The scores of the HHIA correlated very well with the audiometric data. The GBI showed a postoperative benefit for each individual patient.
   Stapes surgery leads to a significant improvement in the hearing handicap and of disease-specific HRQOL. The audiometric parameters were shown as not being a sufficient indicator of social and mental well-being. HRQOL outcome measuring instruments should be used routinely in clinical practice to provide an individualized postoperative assessment.

AB  - Clinical experience has shown that chronic otitis media (COM) affects health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of the patients. Nevertheless, up to now no validated measurement instrument encompassing all the relevant dimensions of HR-QOL is available.
   In phase 1 the development of the Chonic Otitis Media Outcome Test (COMOT) was conducted. A group of experts identified 31 HR-QOL concepts as being relative for COM which was reduced to 15 items (COMOT-15) by sequential statistical analysis on the basis of data from 50 consecutive COM patients. In addition to the overall score (GS), three sub-scores (ear symptoms, OS; hearing function, HF; and mental being, PB) were introduced. In phase 2 validation was performed by calculating reliability, validity, and responsiveness with the data of 121 prospectively evaluated patients.
   COMOT-15 showed an excellent reliability with high internal consistency (Cronbach's Inot sign from 0.89 to 0.91) and high retest reliability coefficients (all r > 0.8). Content validity was determined by a study of the literature. COMOT-15 can distinguish COM patients from healthy subjects. Global assessment of impairment of HR-QOL by COM correlated very well with the scores of COMOT-15. However, the responsiveness of the COMOT-15 questionnaire was low.
   COMOT-15 is a reliable, valid and sensitive instrument for measurement of HR-QOL of COM patients. The results obtained with the questionnaire can be interpreted very well by the investigator. COMOT-15 should be used in otological outcomes research.

AB  - Purpose To assess the postoperative quality of life (QoL) of patients operated on for chronic otitis media (COM) and cholesteatoma by endoscopic approach, with respect to disease-specific complaints and psychological distress, using two validated questionnaires: Chronic Ear Survey (CES) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Methods Eighty-five consecutive patients operated on for cholesteatoma and COM by endoscopic tympanoplasty from March 2018 to February 2020 filled in CES and DASS-21, within one month prior to surgery. A second administration of each questionnaire was performed at the yearly postoperative evaluation. A multivariate analysis using a linear regression model was performed to evaluate the role of the different variables associated with the questionnaires' subscales and overall scores. Results A significant improvement was achieved in all CES and DASS-21 subscales after endoscopic tympanoplasty. No patient showed a DASS-21 score compatible with a psychological distress both at the pre- and postoperative assessments. At multivariate analysis, the only significant factors associated with postoperative improvement in CES scores were preoperative DASS-21 "depression" score and months of follow-up. Conclusion Endoscopic tympanoplasty shows significantly improved QoL as assessed by disease-specific and psycho-emotional questionnaires. A subjective favourable effect of fully endoscopic ear surgery was demonstrated.

AB  - Living systems such as cells and tissues are extremely sensitive to their surrounding physico-chemical microenvironment. In the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, the maintenance of culture conditions suitable for the formation of proliferation niches, for the self-renewal maintenance of stem cells, or for the promotion of a particular differentiation fate is an important issue that has been addressed using different strategies. A number of investigations suggests that a particular cell behavior can be in vitro resembled by mimicking the corresponding in vivo conditions. In this context, several biomimetic environments have been designed in order to control cell phenotypes and functions. In this review, we will analyze the most recent examples of the control of the in vitro physical micro/nanoenvironment by exploiting an innovative technique of high resolution 3D photolithography, the two-photon polymerization (2pp). The biomedical applications of this versatile and disruptive computer assisted design/manufacturing technology are very wide, and range from the fabrication of biomimetic and nanostructured scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, to the microfabrication of biomedical devices, like ossicular replacement prosthesis and microneedles.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in the quality of life of patients who underwent Type 1 tympanoplasty using the Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire 12 (COMQ-12).
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Prospectively collected data of patients aged between 18-65 years, who had undergone type 1 tympanoplasty between January 2018 to January 2019 were included in the study. The Turkish version of COMQ-12 was completed by all of the patients preoperatively as well as 12 months postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative graft uptake outcomes, hearing assessment results, and scores of COMQ-12 were evaluated. Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon test were used.
   RESULTS: A total of 98 patients were included. Noticeable improvement in the severity of symptoms, negative effect on daily life and work routine, health care, and general well-being was detected by subjective scores of the questionnaire. The COMQ-12 preoperative and postoperative overall average score was 25 and 7, respectively (p< 0.001). Graft uptake success was found to be 85%. Hearing assessment evaluation showed a mean change in air conduction values of 8.78 (SD 1.17), and a mean change in air-bone gap values of 7 (SD 0.8), both showing statistical significance (p<0.001).
   CONCLUSIONS: According to the COMQ-12 questionnaire data after surgery, symptom severity, lifestyle and work impact, health service impact, and general discomfort were significantly reduced.

AB  - Objective. To evaluate the long-term quality of life (QoL) in patients operated for cholesteatoma by canal wall-up tympanoplasty (CWUT) or canal wall-down tympanoplasty (CWDT) with mastoid obliteration.
   Methods. QoL was evaluated by the Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire - 12 (COMQ-12). For each patient, the total score and three partial subscores, concerning disease activity, functional impairment and general impact on the patient's life were calculated. These scores were correlated with the surgical technique, as well as anatomical and functional results.
   Results. 68 procedures were classified as CWUT and 78 as CWDT with obliteration. The mean follow-up was 65 months. Total and partial COMQ-12 scores did not show any significant difference between the two groups. Correlation analysis showed a significant direct association between the postoperative Air-Bone Gap (ABG) and both the COMQ-12 total score and functional subscore in the CWUT group.
   Conclusions. This is the first study comparing CWUT and CWDT with obliteration with the COMQ-12, thus confirming the overlapping results in terms of QoL. These findings, together with the evidence of the significantly lower rates of recidivism, show that CWDT with obliteration should be considered as a good alternative to CWUT.

AB  - Objective To compare the outcomes of patients with unilateral otosclerosis treated consecutively by a hearing aid then stapedotomy. Study Design Monocentric, nonrandomized, prospective, longitudinal, cohort study. Setting Tertiary university hospital. Patients Adult patients with a unilateral conductive hearing loss of at least 30 dB caused by otosclerosis. Interventions Consecutive treatment by an external hearing aid followed by stapedotomy. Main Outcome Measures Differences between hearing aids and stapedotomy in quality of life, pure-tone audiometry, binaural hearing, tinnitus severity, and patient satisfaction. Results Twenty-two patients were included, of which 20 (91%) underwent stapedotomy. Stapedotomy demonstrated increased quality of life according to Glasgow Health Status Inventory scores versus hearing aids (+10.4 +/- 9.4 [p = 0.0001]). Stapedotomy versus hearing aids showed improved pure-tone averages (-11.1 +/- 11.0 dB [p = 0.002]) and air-bone gaps (-11.8 +/- 10.7 dB [p = 0.0006]). Stapedotomy was superior to hearing aids for speech-in-noise recognition in the reverse dichotic condition (-8.4 +/- 26.9 dB [p = 0.004]) and showed improved sound localization accuracy in root mean square error (-14.5 +/- 24.5 degrees [p = 0.02]). Stapedotomy, but not hearing aids, showed improved patient self-evaluated tinnitus after baseline adjustment according to the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (-8.0 +/- 13.4 [p = 0.02]) and visual analog scale for tinnitus intensity (-28.7 +/- 34.1 [p = 0.006]). Overall, patients were more satisfied with surgery versus hearing aids. Conclusions Stapedotomy remains more effective compared with hearing aids with greater improvements in quality of life, patient satisfaction, hearing outcomes, and self-evaluated tinnitus.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effect of canal wall up with bony obliteration tympanoplasty (CWU-BOT) on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma by using the chronic otitis media questionnaire 12 (COMQ-12).
   MATERIALS and METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of the COMQ-12 of 26 patients who completed the COMQ-12 before and after a CWU-BOT with eradication of cholesteatoma followed by obliteration of the mastoid and paratympanic space with bone chips and bone pate and reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and ossicular chain.
   RESULTS: All patients were operated upon in our institute between 2014 and 2017.The median score of the 12 questions was preoperatively and postoperatively calculated, and then compared. A large effect was observed in the total score and the questions about running ear, discharge, and visits to the general practitioner. A medium positive size effect was observed in the questions about hearing in noisy surroundings, discomfort, dizziness, tinnitus, medication use, and the mental aspect of the patient. In the questions about the hearing at home and quality of life and impact on work, we noted a small positive size effect. In 50% of patients, the HRQOL became normal; the remaining 50% improved to a level very close to normal.
   CONCLUSION: Canal wall up with bony obliteration tympanoplasty (CWU-BOT) showed a clear decrease in the severity of the symptoms, life and work impact, and health care after surgery.

AB  - Objective: To compare audiologic outcomes, quality-of-life (QoL) and usage-of-device (UoD) between case-matched, otosclerotic patients with mixed hearing loss (MHL) which received (a) stapedotomy and postoperative amplification with hearing aids (SDT+HA) or (b) short-incudial process coupled active middle ear implant with simultaneous stapedotomy (mPP). Study design, setting, and patients: Prospective, matched case-control, follow-up study conducted at two tertiary otologic referral centers. Eligible were all otosclerotic patients with MHL, which received mPP at either of the two institutions. A case-matched-cohort of SDT+HA-patients was generated from the hospitals database based on preoperative audiologic findings. Main outcome measures: For sound- and speech perception, primary outcome parameters were the mean postoperative, aided air-conduction pure tone average (mpa-AC-PTA) and word recognition score at 80 dB speech level (mpa-WRS), for QoL the mean Nijmegen-Cochlear-Implant-Questionnaire (NCIQ) total-score, and for UoD the mean score rated on a 10-point Likert-scale. Results: A total of 28 patients were included; 14 received mPP; mpa-AC-PTA and mpa-WRS significantly improved from 47.1 dB-HL to 34.3 dB-HL (-12.8 dB-HL; p < 0.001) and from 75.0% to 93.2% (+18.2%; p = 0.002) compared to 46.5 dB-HL to 31.9 dB-HL (-14.8 dB-HL; p < 0.008) and 75.0% to 93.2% (+18.2%; p = 0.002) for SDT+HA. No significant difference between groups was observed (all p > 0.1). NCIQ total-score between groups did not significantly differ (70.4 vs. 69.9; p = 0.93). UoD for mPP was significantly higher (6.1 vs. 3.0; p < 0.001). Conclusions: If medical/technical problems prevent usage of HA in otosclerosis with MHL, mPP can be considered as effective treatment option with similar audiological outcome and QoL. A significantly higher UoD for mPP was observed.

AB  - Congenital middle ear malformations are rare. Most part of them are usually associated with other malformations, such as aural atresia, microtia, and dysmorphic craniofacial features. A clinical case of a 24-year-old male with a right-sided conductive hearing loss since his childhood, without craniofacial malformation, is presented. He was proposed for exploratory tympanotomy under the suspicious diagnosis of otosclerosis. The surgery revealed an abnormal location of stapes' superstructure, which was attached to the promontory and had an isolated and mobile osseous footplate in the oval window. A stapes prosthesis was inserted and resulted in closure of the air-bone gap by 25 dB. A review of the literature was also performed using MEDLINE. Two theories diverge on the embryologic origin of the stapes. Our findings seem to be in favour of the theory that defines two different embryologic origins to the stapes.

AB  - The ossicular chain of the human middle ear has a key role in sound conduction since it transfers vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea, connecting the outer and the inner part of the hearing organ.
   This study reports firstly a description of the main anatomical features of the middle ear to introduce a detailed survey of its biomechanics, focused on model development, with a collection of geometric, inertial and mechanical/material parameters. The joint issues are particularly discussed from the perspective of developing a model of the middle ear both explanatory and predictive. Such a survey underlines the remarkable dispersion of data, due also to the lack of a standardization of the experimental techniques and conditions.
   Subsequently, a 3D multi-body model of the ossicular chain and other structures of the middle ear is described. Such an approach is justified as the ossicles were proven to behave as rigid bodies in the human hearing range and was preferred to the more widely used finite element one as it simplifies the model development and improves joint modeling. The displacement of the umbo (a reference point of the tympanic membrane) in the 0.3-6 kHz frequency range was defined as input of the model, while the stapes footplate displacement as output. A parameter identification procedure was used to find parameter values for reproducing experimental and numerical reference curves taken from the literature. This simple model might represent a valid alternative to more complex models and might provide a useful tool to simulate pathological/post-surgical/post-traumatic conditions and evaluate ossicular replacement prostheses.

KW  - Perilymphatic gusher
KW  - Osteogenesis imperfecta
KW  - Stapes surgery
AB  - Perilymphatic gusher is a rare event during stapes surgery that can have dramatic consequences on hearing outcomes. While gusher has been reported in X-linked deafness and otosclerosis, this is the first report of perilymphatic gusher during stapedotomy in osteogenesis imperfecta. A 15-year-old female, with no hearing or vestibular symptoms aside from mixed hearing loss, underwent endoscopic stapedotomy when a perilymphatic gusher was unexpectedly encountered intraoperatively. Prompt insertion of the stapes prosthesis and packing with fascial and cartilage graft were used to manage the gusher. At 7-month follow-up, the patient reported improved hearing and denied dizziness; audiogram showed complete closure of air-bone gap. Preoperative computed tomography scan did not reveal obvious radiologic signs to predict the gusher. Perilymphatic gusher should thus be recognized by the otologic surgeon as a possible complication during stapes surgery in osteogenesis imperfecta despite normal imaging findings. Patients and their families should be counseled of this risk appropriately.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of the study were to assess health-related quality of life and hearing-related disability in subjects with otosclerosis 30 years after surgery. Design: An observational study was performed. Medical records were reviewed, a clinical examination as well as audiometric assessments were performed. Generic health-related quality of life was assessed by the SF-36v2 and hearing disability by a shortened version of SSQ (speech spatial and qualities of hearing scale). Study sample: Sixty-five individuals, who had undergone stapedectomy in 1977-79 at a tertiary referral center. Results: Generic health-related quality of life according to SF-36 subscale scores was comparable to that of an age-and sex-matched reference population. The SF-36 mental component summary score (MCS) was, however, significantly better than that of the reference population. The mental and physical summary component scores correlated significantly to hearing disability measured by the SSQ but not to hearing impairment. Hearing disability was displayed in all SSQ sub-scores, especially in more complex listening situations and in the localization of sounds.

AB  - Objective: Patients with moderate-to-severe mixed hearing losses (MHLs) are hard to provide sufficient benefit with currently available conventional hearing aids. Here, the long-term safety of a direct acoustic cochlear stimulator (DACS) and the effectiveness compared with conventional "high-performance'' hearing aids were investigated.
   Study Design: Prospective, within patient reference, nonrandomized, interventional multicenter clinical study performed at these 3 centers: Medical University Hannover, University of Heidelberg, and Helios Hospital Krefeld.
   Patients and Intervention: Ten otosclerosis patients with severe-to-profound MHL were preoperatively fitted with state-of-the-art conventional hearing aids (HA). After 2 months of testing conventional HA, 9 of the patients decided to be implanted with a DACS.
   Main Outcome Measures: Air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) aided and unaided thresholds, speech discrimination before and after implantation and at 3, 6, and 12 months after activation. The subjective benefit was assessed by the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB).
   Results: Preoperative hearing thresholds were preserved over the 12 month observation time after activation. Average functional gain (0.5-4 kHz) achieved with conventional HA was 47 dB compared with 56 dB with the DACS. Speech-in-noise tests revealed a lower SNR for DACS (3.1 dB) than for the HA (6.6 dB) and patients were more satisfied with the DACS.
   Conclusion: The DACS significantly improved hearing, speech intelligibility, and satisfaction in patients with a severe-to-profound mixed hearing loss and can be considered a safe and useful alternative to conventional hearing aids.

AB  - Conventional hearing aids have improved significantly in recent years; however, amplification of sound within the external auditory canal creates a number of intrinsic problems, including acoustic feedback and the need for a tight ear mold to increase usable gain.  Nonacoustic alternatives which could obviate these encumbrances have not become practical due to inefficient coupling (piezoelectric techniques) or unfeasible power requirements (electromagnetic techniques).  Recent technical advances, however, prompted a major clinical investigation of a new electromagnetic, semi-implantable hearing device.
   This study presents the details of clinical phase I, in which an electromagnetic driver was coupled with a target magnet temporarily affixed onto the lateral surface of the malleus of six hearing aid users with sensorineural losses.
   The results indicate that the electromagnetic hearing device provides sufficient gain and output characteristics to benefit individuals with sensorineural hearing loss.  Significant improvements compared to conventional hearing aids were noted in pure-tone testing and, to a lesser degree, in speech discrimination.  Subjective responses were quite favorable, indicating that the electromagnetic hearing device 1.  produces no acoustic feedback; 2.  works well in noisy environments; and 3.  provides a more quiet, natural sound than patients' conventional hearing aids.
   These favorable results led to phase II of the project, in which patients with surgically amenable mixed hearing losses were implanted with the target magnet incorporated within a hydroxyapatite ossicular prosthesis.  The results of this second-stage investigation were also encouraging and will be reported separately.

AB  - Objective: The aims of this study were to adapt the Swedish version of the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) to the International Outcome Inventory for Alternative Interventions (IOI-AI) in the context of ear surgery (IOI-AI(op)) and to test the psychometric properties. Design: The validated Swedish questionnaire IOI-HA was adapted to the IOI-AI(op) by omitting the question about hearing aid use and changing the term "hearing aid" to "surgery" in the remaining items. The validity, component structure and reliability of the IOI-AI(op) were assessed. Study sample: Subjects diagnosed with otosclerosis and undergoing stapedotomy were included in the study (n = 162). Results: High mean scores were noted for all items. Ceiling effects were noted, most pronounced for the satisfaction item. Principal component analysis (PCA) yielded a two-component structure explaining 77.5% of the variance. The test-retest reliability measured by intra class correlation coefficient was >0.9, and the internal consistency coefficient measured by Cronbach's alfa was >0.8. Conclusion: The IOI-AI(op) showed good psychometric properties. However, ceiling effects were observed. The two-component solution was in line with previous factor analyses of the IOI-HA and the IOI-AI. The comprehensive IOI-AI(op) is recommended as a useful tool to evaluate patient perspectives after ear surgery.

AB  - Purpose: To present the surgical technique and clinical outcomes of a novel modification to conventional meatoplasty.
   Materials and methods: All consecutive patients undergoing canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy incorporating the one-cut meatoplasty technique between January 2009 and February 2013 were evaluated. Primary outcome measures included meatal stenosis requiring revision surgery, frequency of drainage beyond 2 months postoperatively and results of a composite patient questionnaire incorporating the Chronic Ear Survey.
   Results: Twenty-eight of 36 (78%) eligible patients completed a questionnaire and were included. All ears underwent canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy utilizing the one-cut meatoplasty technique. At a mean follow-up of 38.0 months, the average Chronic Ear Survey score was 78.6 +/- 2.6 points. There was only one case of postoperative meatal stenosis. Intermittent otorrhea developed in 14.3% of cases but was remedied by conservative measures including in-office cleaning, ototopical therapy and water precautions. Eighty-nine percent of patients denied any self-consciousness about the aesthetic appearance of the ear.
   Conclusions: The one-cut meatoplasty is an effective alternative to traditional techniques that is simple to perform. The results of the Chronic Ear Survey indicate that the one-cut meatoplasty supports a stable and healthy, open cavity with functional results that compare favorably to other series evaluating canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy with traditional meatoplasty. Additionally, patients report high satisfaction with the appearance of their ear, and all hearing aid users could continue to utilize a hearing aid without feedback, pain, or other difficulties related to poor fitting.

AB  - PurposeThe aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness and acceptance of the active middle ear implant system Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB & REG;, MED-EL, Austria) in patients with aural atresia or aplasia (children and adults).MethodsData from 51 patients (mean age 13.9 & PLUSMN; 11.3 years), 42 (79.2%) children and adolescents, and 11 (20.8%) adults) who received a VSB implant between 2009 and 2019 at the Department of Otolaryngology at LMU Clinic Grosshadern, Munich were included in the study. Pure-tone audiometry, speech recognition in a quiet environment and in a noisy environment were performed preoperatively, during the first fitting of the audio processor, after 1-3 years, after 3-5 years, and after 5 years (if possible). The follow-up period ranged from 11 to 157 months with a mean of 58.6 months (4.8 years). Furthermore, the benefit of the VSB was evaluated by self-assessment questionnaires (Speech, Spatial, and Qualities of Hearing Scale, respectively, for parents).ResultsSignificant improvements were observed in hearing and speech comprehension immediately after the initial fitting of the VSB system (mean hearing gain 38.4 & PLUSMN; 9.4 dB HL) and at follow-up intervals (1-3, 3-5 and after 5 years) for children and adults (p < 0.01). The values remained stable over the long-term, indicating a sustained functional gain from the VSB (mean hearing gain 38.9 & PLUSMN; 9.2 dB HL). The results of the self-assessments affirm the positive influence on hearing and speech comprehension with the VSB. With the VSB, there was an improvement of 41.3 & PLUSMN; 13.7% in the Freiburg monosyllable test.ConclusionThese results (a stable hearing gain over the long term, a good tolerance of the implant and an improvement in quality of life) affirm the recommendation for using the active middle ear implant VSB as early as permitted for aural atresia and aplasia patients. This study represents the audiometric results with the (to date) largest collective of aural atresia patients and with a long follow-up period.

AB  - Purpose The aim of the study was to investigate the change in health-related quality of life ( HRQoL) after canal wall up cholesteatoma surgery, using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI).
   Methods Data from a consecutive group of 47 adults scheduled for primary cholesteatoma surgery using canal wall up (CWU) with obliteration, from January 2005 to December 2009, were analysed. Information was extracted from a medical database, and complementary data from patient files and audiograms were collected and recorded retrospectively. The GBI questionnaire was used for the assessment of HRQoL after surgery.
   Results There was no finding of residual or recurrent cholesteatomas in the study group. Hearing was improved at 1 and 3 years postoperatively. No patient suffered a total hearing loss. The overall GBI scores showed an improved HRQoL after surgery. Twenty-nine (85%) patients benefitted from surgery, 1 (3%) had no change, and 4 (12%) expressed deterioration.
   Conclusions Cholesteatoma surgery using CWU with obliteration gives an improved HRQoL for the majority of patients. The GBI questionnaire provides complementary information to hearing and healing results after cholesteatoma surgery.

AB  - Otosclerosis affects health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Until now, measurements have only been performed using audiometric data or non-validated quality of life questionnaires.
   The objective of this study was to develop the first validated disease-specific HRQOL measuring instrument to determine HRQOL in otosclerosis.
   After sequential analysis and item reduction of the initial Stapesplasty Outcome Test 47 (SPOT-47), the SPOT-25 was validated prospectively on 52 otosclerosis patients undergoing stapes surgery. In addition to the overall score, four subscores were defined (hearing function, tinnitus, social restrictions, mental condition).
   The SPOT-25 showed a high internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha > 0.7), allowed discrimination between otosclerosis patients and healthy subjects, and demonstrated acceptable test-retest reliability (r = 0.85). After stapes surgery, the HRQOL improved significantly. The responsiveness was high.
   The SPOT-25 is the first validated disease-specific instrument for HRQOL measurement in otosclerosis patients. It should be used routinely for quality control.

AB  - Hypothesis: To mechanically stimulate the round window (RW) membrane, an actuator with an interface coupler (IC) has the potential to improve sound transmission to the cochlea as compared to the most used RW stimulation device implanted today. If a proof-of-concept IC prototype shows promise as compared the most common method for RW stimulation, there is potential that future design development of an IC will be worthwhile.Background: A variety of hearing pathologies resulting in mixed and conductive hearing loss can be addressed by mechanically stimulating the RW to transmit sound to the cochlea. The most common method for RW stimulation is with the floating mass transducer (FMT, Med-El). However, the FMT suffers poor sound transmission and unreliable device positioning. The dynamic range and bandwidth of the FMT as a RW stimulator is limited because the entire FMT needs freedom to vibrate. Thus the FMT has difficulty overcoming its own inertia and it cannot be stabilized in a manner that may limit its motion. Here we test an idea of using a generic actuator that vibrates on one side while stationary and held stable on the other (unlike the FMT), and coupling the actuator vibration to the RW membrane with a proof-of concept IC designed to safely transmit sound to the cochlea. We determine if this proof-of-concept IC can perform as well or better than the FMT in one specimen. If so, further developments of the IC would be worthwhile.Methods: RW sound transmission comparison was made between an ideally implanted FMT and a proof of-concept IC prototype driven by a piezoelectric stack actuator with vibrating tip in a fresh human temporal bone. Velocities of stapes, FMT, and IC actuator were measured with laser Doppler vibrometry to determine bandwidth, linearity, and dynamic range of cochlear sound transmission. Results: Stimulation with proof-of-concept prototype of the IC provided increased sound transmission, more linear output for larger dynamic range, and wider frequency range as compared to the FMT. This experiment demonstrates the potential of the IC concept to improve performance, and that it merits further development. However, it was challenging to stabilize the coupling between an external actuator and the proof-of-concept IC prototype. Thus, although we were successful in showing that this IC concept has promise, major design improvements and developments are required in the future. Conclusions: We demonstrated that the proof-of-concept IC prototype driven with a tip connected to a piezoelectric stack actuator can stimulate the RW membrane with improved acoustic performance as compared to the FMT in one specimen. This study demonstrated proof of concept: that the idea of an IC for sound transmission to the cochlea through the RW has potential, and that it would be worthwhile to pursue the IC idea with further developments. This idea has the potential to provide robust sound transmission to the cochlea via the RW while preventing possible trauma to the cochlea. We also learned that critical design improvements are necessary because coupling the generic external actuator to the IC was challenging. A possible future IC design is to integrate a piezoelectric actuator permanently to the IC, allowing only the soft balloon membrane of the IC to vibrate the RW while the rest of the exterior housing of the combined IC (with actuator) would not vibrate and would be stabilized in a fixed manner.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: To review short- and longer-term results of type III tympanoplasties as performed by the senior author and to compare these results with those reported in the literature.
   Method: Retrospective review of 96 type III tympanoplasties, with and without mastoidectomy, performed between April 1996 and August 2000.
   Results: At a mean of 384 days postoperatively, 57.3% of patients had an air-bone gap of less than 20 dB. The average postoperative gap is 21.4 dB. Gap closure is best at 2000 Hz, with an average drop of 51% from initial value, compared with 34%, 39%, and 18% at 500, 1000, and 4000 Hz, respectively.
   Conclusion: Our results are similar to those published previously. We emphasize the improvement at 2000 Hz, which is an important frequency for speech discrimination. It would be interesting to see if it correlates with an improvement in quality of life.

AB  - Objectives To analyze health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and audiological results after stapes surgery using a Nitinol Head Prosthesis (NHP). Methods Study-Design Prospective longitudinal study. Patients Patients undergoing stapes surgery for otosclerosis and stapes reconstruction with a NHP between January 2018 and December 2018 (n = 48). Intervention Audiological measurements preoperatively and at 6 months follow-up as well as two questionnaires assessing HRQoL, i.e., the Stapes Plasty Outcome Test 25 (SPOT-25) and the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Main outcome measures Correlation of pure tone average (4PTA 0.5-3 kHz) with questionnaires assessing HrQOL preoperatively and at follow-up after stapes surgery. Results Patients showed a significantly reduced air-bone-gap (ABG, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz) at the follow up visit (median: 11.3 dB, IQR 5.0-14.4) compared to the preoperative measurements (median 27.5 dB, IQR 21.9-36.3). Disease-specific HRQoL improved significantly in all scales of the SPOT-25 apart from the subscore "tinnitus". Postoperatively, the subscore "hearing function" correlated well only with the ABG (r = 0.59, p = 0.001). The SPOT-25 and GBI total scores showed a moderate negative correlation (r = - 0.59, p = 0.008). Conclusions Stapes surgery leads to significant improvements of hearing and the HRQoL. However, correlations between HRQoL questionnaire scores and the audiometric outcomes were inconclusive, indicating that the use of HRQoL measures for the assessment of stapedotomy outcomes to complement objective outcomes should be encouraged.

AB  - Objective: To assess the factors affecting health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after ear surgery in patients with chronic otitis media (COM).
   Design: Prospective questionnaire-based outcome study.
   Setting: Tertiary care institution.
   Patients: The study population comprised 205 patients aged 21 to 67 years referred for ear surgery owing to COM with or without cholesteatoma between November 2009 and March 2011.
   Interventions: The ear surgery for COM included tympanoplasty, with or without mastoidectomy. The Korean version of the Chronic Ear Survey (K-CES), a disease-specific outcome survey, was administered before and 12 months after surgery.
   Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were the total score and subscale score, including an activity restriction-based subscale, symptom subscale, and medical resource utilization subscale. The scores were analyzed with disease-and patient-related factors affecting health-related quality of life.
   Results: Of the 205 patients enrolled, complete data from 156 patients were available for this study. The K-CES score in patients with COM improved after ear surgery in total and in all subscales of the K-CES (P<.001). In univariable analysis, poor improvement in total K-CES score was more likely to occur after ear surgery in patients with postoperative complications, diabetes mellitus, hearing loss as a chief complaint, lower air conduction threshold in postoperative audiometry, and a high level of education and in those who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy (P<.05). Multivariable analysis using multiple linear regression revealed that the occurrence of complications, presence of diabetes mellitus, level of education, and postoperative air conduction thresholds were independent factors for poor improvement in total K-CES score (P<.05).
   Conclusion: Recognition of factors that have significant relation with subjective outcomes may help surgeons to identify patients who are prone to have a lower satisfaction and provide useful information in preoperative counseling.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To investigate the simultaneous application of cartilage tympanoplasty combined with eustachian tube (ET) balloon dilatation in the treatment of adhesive otitis media (AdOM). Study Design Multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Methods Patients with AdOM were randomly divided into four groups: control group (conservative treatment), ET balloon dilatation (ETBD) group, cartilage tympanoplasty (CT) group, and cartilage tympanoplasty combined with ET balloon dilatation (ETBD+CT) group. Patients were followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment, receiving otoendoscopy and pure-tone audiometry, and were evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), visual analogue scale (VAS) for the symptom of ear stuffiness, Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test (COMOT-15), and eustachian tube scores (ETS). Results There was no improvement in tympanic membrane (TM) morphology and mean pure-tone air-bone gap (ABG) after treatment in the control and ETBD groups. The postoperative TM morphology was improved in the CT group and ETBD+CT group, although retraction pockets reoccurred in two cases of CT group. Reduced ABG and improvements in ETS, THI, VAS, and COMOT-15 were all achieved in these two groups, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions Cartilage tympanoplasty combined with ET balloon dilatation could be used as an appropriate surgical technique for AdOM, which could relieve the symptoms of tinnitus and ear stuffiness, and improve postoperative TM morphology, hearing level, ET functions, and quality of life, with low incidence of complications.

AB  - Purpose Different types of chronic middle ear disease (CMED) present with differing severity of single symptoms, such as discharge, vertigo or hearing loss, which impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Here, we aimed to (i) investigate characteristics of HRQoL and (ii) evaluate the association between HRQoL and hearing among different types of CMED. Methods In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we included adult patients undergoing surgical treatment for CMED. Primary outcomes included HRQoL assessed by the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21) and hearing assessed by pure-tone audiometry. Results In the included 108 patients (51% females), CMED were chronic otitis media (COM) with (n = 46) or without (n = 22) cholesteatoma, persistent mastoid cavity (with [n = 15] or without [n = 10] recurrent cholesteatoma), revision ossiculoplasty for hearing restoration (n = 14), and postinflammatory meatal fibrosis (n = 1). Preoperatively, the mean ZCMEI-21 score showed statistically significant differences among different types of CMED (p = 0.007) with persistent mastoid cavity without cholesteatoma exhibiting the highest score (34.1, SD 7.7) indicating poor HRQoL. At a mean follow-up period of 183 days, no statistically significant differences in the ZCMEI-21 scores among different types of CMED were observed (p = 0.67). Conclusion This study objectifies differences in HRQoL among different types of CMED. In patients with indication for functional surgery only, e.g., persistent mastoid cavity without cholesteatoma, the worst HRQoL was observed. Yet, in these types of CMED, HRQoL guides decision for treatment. Moreover, differences in HRQoL among different types of CMED were not closely associated with hearing, but largely depended on other symptoms, such as discharge or vertigo.

AB  - Background: Some preoperative and postoperative audiological outcomes may be associated with quality of life (QoL) in stapedotomy patients. Aims: The aim of this study is to determine which frequencies and conduction pathways improve following this surgery and to assess their effects on QoL. Material and methods: Cases who underwent small fenestra stapedotomy were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative and postoperative pure tone audiometry were evaluated. The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) questionnaire was also administered to assess the impact of the operation on their QoL. The relationship between audiologic results and QoL was also examined. Results: A total of 45 ears from 41 patients were included in the study. There is a statistically significant improvement in postoperative mean air conduction (AC), bone conduction (BC) and air-bone gap (ABG) values compared to preoperative values (p < .001). A significant moderate correlation was found between preoperative mean ABG and GBI scores, and between postoperative improvements in AC thresholds and ABG at all frequencies (500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz) and GBI scores (0.3<r < 0.7, p < .05). Among the postoperative BC thresholds, only the improvement at 2,000 Hz was found to have an effect on the GBI score (r = .309, p = .049). Conclusions and significance: Audiological outcomes following stapedotomy had an impact on QoL. Preoperative ABG can be used as an indicator of postoperative QOL.

AB  - Objective: To validate a disease-specific health related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument for children with chronic suppurative otitis media with or without cholesteatoma. Methods: Caregivers of 45 children with chronic suppurative otitis media, who were offered an operation (tympanoplasty or radical mastoidectomy) in a tertiary children's hospital, were administered a 5-item quality of life survey (COM-5) The COM-5, which is a modified version of OM-6, was administered four times: few weeks and few days before operation and six months and one year postoperativety. Psychometric characteristics and more specifically test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct validity, and responsiveness to clinical change of the COM-5 score were the main outcome measures.
   Results: Median COM-5 score was 2.6 (1 - to 7-point scale) with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life. Test-retest reliability was good (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.73) Construct validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between COM-5 score and global ear-related quality of life (R = -0.485), between physical suffering and ear-related physician visits (R = 0.41) and between caregiver concerns vs ear-related physician visits (R = 0.44). The mean change in COM-5 score after successful tympanoplasty was 1.1 and correlated welt with the change of global ear-retated quality of life rating (R = -0.545) as well as with the degree of clinical change reported by the caregiver (R = 0.494). The mean standardized response was 1.3 after tympanoplasty indicating the instrument's large responsiveness to clinical change after this procedure, but only 0.7 after radical mastoidectomy.
   Conclusions: The COM-5 is a valid, reliable and responsive instrument. Apart from its satisfactory psychometric characteristics, it can be easily administered in caregivers of children who require a tympanoplasty due to chronic suppurative otitis media.

AB  - To compare the efficacy between the commonly used sealing materials, i.e., adipose tissue and the gelfoam in primary endoscopic stapedotomy. Lobular fat and gelfoam have been used in patients who underwent endoscopic stapedotomy between two groups, each containing 29 patients. The hearing outcomes and postoperative complications were compared at the end of 12 weeks between two groups. The ABG of <= 10 dB was achieved in 69% of cases in group A and 76% of cases in group B. There was a significant short-term (1 week) improvement in the Dizziness Handicap Inventory score (p = 00) with patients of adipose tissue seal compared to the gelfoam. Although the audiological outcomes were comparable between the two groups, the use of the adipose tissue can be a better alternative than gelfoam to control vertigo in the early postoperative period without causing any significant morbidity to the patient.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the association between the "ChOLE" classification, hearing outcomes and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods In two tertiary referral centers, patients requiring primary or revision surgery for cholesteatoma were assessed for eligibility. Audiometric assessment was performed pre- and postoperatively. The ChOLE classification was determined intraoperatively and via the preoperative CT scan. HRQoL was assessed pre- and postoperatively using the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21). Results A total of 87 patients (mean age 45.2 years, SD 16.2) were included in this study. ChOLE stage I cholesteatoma was found in 8 (9%), stage II cholesteatoma was found in 65 (75%), and stage III cholesteatoma was found in 14 (16%) patients. Postoperatively, the mean air-bone gap (0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz) was significantly smaller than before surgery (14.3 dB vs. 23.0 dB; p = 0.0007). The mean ZCMEI-21 total score significantly decreased after surgery (26.8 vs. 20.7, p = 0.004). No correlation between the ZCMEI-21 total score and both the ChOLE stage and the extent of the cholesteatoma (ChOLE subdivision "Ch") was found. A trend towards worse HRQoL associated with a poorer status of the ossicular chain (ChOLE subdivision "O") was observed. The audiometric outcomes were not associated with the extent of the cholesteatoma. The ChOLE subdivision describing the ossicular status showed a strong association with the pre- and postoperative air conduction (AC) thresholds. Further, the ZCMEI-21 total score and its hearing subscore correlated with the AC thresholds. Conclusion The ChOLE classification does not show a clear association with HRQoL measured by the ZCMEI-21. The HRQoL neither seems to be associated with the extent of the disease nor with the ossicular chain status. Yet, surgical therapy significantly improved HRQoL by means of reduced ZCMEI-21 total scores, which were strongly associated with the AC thresholds. Intraoperative assessment of a cholesteatoma using the ChOLE classification and HRQoL complement each other and provide useful information.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by means of the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), the quality of life of patients who had undergone either intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) or canal wall down tympanoplasty (CWDT) with mastoid obliteration.
   Methods: This was a retrospective case review study performed at a tertiary referral center. Among 379 patients affected by middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma operated on between November 2000 and December 2009, 50 patients who underwent ICWT and 50 who underwent CWDT with mastoid obliteration were randomly selected. The CES scores were analyzed for both groups.
   Results: The mean scores on the CES were 6.5 +/- 2.1 in patients who underwent CWDT and 6.9 +/- 2.2 in patients treated with ICWT (t = -0.93; p > 0.05). No significant differences between the two groups were found on the activity restriction, symptom, or medical resource subscales (p > 0.05).
   Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that CWDT with mastoid obliteration resulted in a quality of life comparable with that after ICWT. Postoperative hearing loss is the most frequently reported problem for both techniques.

AB  - Objective To assess the change in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients undergoing mastoid cavity obliteration. Methods Patients who had undergone canal wall-down mastoidectomy for chronic otitis media with creation of a persistent mastoid cavity and underwent revision tympanomastoid surgery including mastoid cavity obliteration using autologous material were included. Audiological measurements including air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) pure-tone averages (PTA) and the air-bone gap (ABG) were assessed. Health-related Quality of Life (HRQoL) was assessed by the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21) pre- and postoperatively. Results A total of 25 patients (16 females and 9 males; mean age 51.6 years, 14 right and 11 left ears) were included. Patients were reexamined after a mean follow-up period of 9.2 months (SD = 6.5) after obliteration of the mastoid cavity. Compared to the preoperative visit, patients showed a significantly reduced AC PTA at the postoperative visit (mean difference: - 4.1; SD = 10.4, p = 0.045). The mean ZCMEI-21 score changed from 31.7 (SD = 14.5) preoperatively to 17.4 (SD = 15.1) postoperatively (mean difference: - 14.3; SD = 19.1; p = 0.0002). The mean ZCMEI-21 score changes were neither correlated to the AC PTA shift (p = 0.60) nor to the ABG shift (p = 0.66). Conclusions This is the first study reporting a highly significant and clinically important improvement in HRQoL after mastoid cavity obliteration in a prospective setting. The improvement in HRQoL was not correlated to the hearing improvement. As a clinical implication, we provide evidence for a substantial subjective benefit of the surgical obliteration of a symptomatic mastoid cavity and, therefore, encourage this surgical procedure.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: To study hearing status and quality of life outcomes in patients with conductive hearing loss (CBL), and to develop a prognostic disease severity staging system for use in future clinical outcomes studies in CBL. Study Design: Clinical outcomes research study in three stages: 1) Prospective development and psychometric validation of a disease-specific hearing status outcomes instrument for CHL. 2) Prospective observational outcomes study of patient-based hearing status and quality of life (QOL) outcomes after treatment of CHL. 3) Development of a prognostic disease-severity staging system to stratify patients into groups of similar treatment outcome. Methods: Psychometric instrument validation: assessment of test-retest reliability, internal consistency reliability, content, construct and criterion validity, and responsiveness to change. Statistical assessment of the impact of CHL on patient-based hearing status and QOL, and the change in hearing status and QOL after treatment. Using data from the prospective study and multivariate regression, identification of pretreatment independent variables, which predict good outcome after treatment, and development of a severity staging system. Results: Test-retest reliability (r > 0.70) and internal consistency reliability (alpha > 0.70) were adequate for both subscales of the hearing status instrument. Construct validity was demonstrated by adequate convergent/divergent validity with other health status instruments on multi-item multitrait correlation matrixes. Criterion validity was demonstrated using audiometric threshold data. Responsiveness to change was demonstrated using the standardized response mean after treatment (SRM = 0.40 and 0.61 for the two subscales). Emotional hearing status and social/situational hearing status improved significantly after treatment of CHL: emotional score, 31.1 to 56.6 (P < .001); social/situational score, 56.7 to 63.7 (P = .01). Mean QOL subscale scores for patients with CHL were not significantly different from healthy populations, and global QOL scores did not change significantly after treatment of CBL. Using proportional improvement in emotional hearing status as an outcome, we identified several pretreatment factors that predicted good outcome (i.e., larger proportional improvement): level of pretreatment emotional hearing status, presence of sensorineural component of HL, and etiology of CHL (otosclerosis vs. all other causes). Some hypothesized predictive independent factors, such as bilateral HL, audiometric threshold level, pretreatment functional status, employment status, age, and duration of BL, were not identified as significant predictors of outcome in the multivariate analysis. We constructed a prognostic disease severity staging system in which the three predictor variables were each given a score of 0 or 1, and these three scores were added to obtain the disease stage (stage 0, 1, 2, or 3). Higher disease stage indicated more severe disease or a lower proportional improvement in emotional hearing status after treatment. This staging system appropriately stratified patients into groups of similar outcome after treatment (P = .02) and has significant potential use for future outcomes research on CHL. Conclusions: We have developed and validated a patient-based hearing status outcomes instrument for use in CHL. We have measured hearing status and quality of life outcomes after treatment of CHL, and we have developed a prognostic disease severity staging system that predicts the improvement in emotional hearing status after treatment of CHL.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate and compare hearing outcomes, intraoperative and postoperative complications and tinnitus characteristics, with particular regard to the effects of stapes surgery on the course of tinnitus. Two groups were evaluated: one group of patients were treated with classical stapedotomy and the second group was composed of patients who underwent reversal technique. Eighty-four patients aged between 22 and 62 years with otosclerosis were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 49, 17 male, mean age 38, patients treated with classic stapedotomy) and group 2 (n = 35, 13 male, mean age 40, patients treated with reversal stapedotomy). Classical and reversal stapedotomy techniques were performed using CO2 laser; self-crimping titanium piston prosthesis were positioned in patients treated with reversal stapedotomy and classical stapedotomy. Preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluation using pure tone audiometry (air-bone gap (ABG), bone-conduction thresholds and air-conduction thresholds). Tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) scale and intraoperative/postoperative complications were assessed in both groups. Wilcoxon's test and Friedman's test followed by post hoc analysis were used. There were no statistically significant differences in ABG, air conduction, bone conduction, and THI score variations after surgery between the two groups. Complications in both groups were not significant, and different. In conclusion, reversal and classic stapedotomies performed with CO2 laser can be considered efficient, safe and reliable techniques considering the hearing outcomes and complications recorded.

AB  - Background: The surgical treatment of otosclerosis consists of the replacement of the stapes using a piston.
   Aims/Objectives: The objective of this study is to assess the audiometric results and quality of life (QOL) of patients who underwent surgery for otosclerosis by stapedectomy with fascia interposition (STIP) or by stapedotomy using CO2 laser (SLaser) without fascia interposition.
   Material and Methods: Ninety-one patients operated on for otosclerosis by STIP (40 patients) and by SLaser (51 patients) were included. Audiometric results were graphically displayed using the Amsterdam Hearing Evaluation Plot and were compared to the Common Otology Database (COD) comprising 660 patients. The patients' QOL was assessed with an otological validated survey. The significance level was p < .05.
   Results: There was no significant difference in hearing improvement between SLaser and STIP-operated patients. There was no significant difference between our results and that of COD. QOL was significantly improved (+3.5/10) postoperatively for both STIP and SLaser in both social and professional fields.
   Conclusions and Significance: By comparing QOL and hearing gain of STIP and SLaser, our results suggest that both surgical techniques are a safe and successful treatment for otosclerotic stapes fixation. Further studies aiming at comparing larger series may confirm and refine these results.

AB  - Background: Eustachian tube dysfunction is a poorly defined condition associated with various symptoms and it can predispose to middle-ear disease. Balloon dilation Eustachian tuboplasty has been proposed as a treatment for Eustachian tube dysfunction.
   Objective: To evaluate the subjective and objective outcomes of balloon dilation Eustachian tuboplasty in patients with recurrent, previously treated chronic Eustachian tube dysfunction.
   Methods: The study was conducted on 11 patients ( 13 ears) who had undergone previous unsuccessful medical and surgical treatment. Tympanometry was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included pure tone audiogram assessment and seven-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire score.
   Results: Balloon dilation Eustachian tuboplasty resulted in significant improvements in 11 patients' subjective but not objective outcome measures.
   Conclusion: The objective abnormality and subjective symptoms in Eustachian tube dysfunction may represent two distinct pathological processes, which may nevertheless influence and exacerbate each other.

AB  - Objective: Our study aimed to translate the chronic otitis media questionnaire-12 (COMQ-12) into the Arabic language, evaluate the internal consistency of the test and test-retest reliability, and validate the adaptation for further use in Arabic studies. Study Design: A prospective observation monocenter cohort study. Settings: This study was done at Kafrelsheikh University Hospital, Egypt. Patients: One hundred twenty five ear pathology-free patients were asked to complete the questionnaire forming group A. One hundred twenty five patients with different forms of COM completed the questionnaire 2 weeks before the planned ear surgery and the same day of the operation, forming group B. Those patients who underwent the ear surgery, completed the questionnaire again 6 months after the operation forming group C. Intervention: We did an Arabic forward and backward translation of the original COMQ-12. The patients in group B underwent ear surgery (tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy). After fulfilling the questionnaire in different groups, we assessed the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of COMQ-12: internal consistency, reliability, reproducibility, validity, and responsiveness. Main Outcome Measures: Cronbach's alpha was 0.973. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 0.981, while the Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.973. Results: A statistically significant difference was present between group A (average total score 2.38 +/- 1.543) and group B (average total score 35.86 +/- 5.98). Also, there was a statistically significant difference between group B and group C (average total score 7.46 +/- 8.294). The calculated cut-off point of the total score was more than or equal to eight. Conclusion: The cross-culturally Arabic adaptation of COMQ-12 was reliable, valid with strong internal consistency and responsiveness. It can detect the significant effect of COM on the quality of life of Arabic patients. This effect would be improved obviously after surgical management that markedly enhanced the preoperative hearing problem.

AB  - Objectives: A cross-sectional observational study was designed to evaluate patient satisfaction after stapedotomy. Methods: Two validated questionnaires, the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS) and the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI), were used to assess patients for whom audiometric data were available. Results: The response rate was 79%. The PIADS score showed that 96% of patients reported an improvement in quality of life. The HHI score, however, showed that 32% of patients still experienced a marked degree of handicap after surgery. The HHI scores correlated positively with postoperative audiometric data, and the PIADS scores correlated positively with the degree of change in audiometric data. Conclusions: The results of this study support the role of small fenestra stapedotomy as a primary treatment for otosclerosis. The study also identifies a certain subpopulation of patients with residual handicap who may require further aural rehabilitation.

AB  - BACKGROUND. The goal of our investigation was to facilitate research on clinical negotiation between patients and physicians by developing a reliable and valid classification system for patients' requests in office practice.
   METHODS. We developed the Taxonomy of Requests by Patients (TORP) using input from researchers, clinicians, and patient focus groups. To assess the system's reliability and validity, we applied TORP to audiotaped encounters between 139 patients and 6 northern California internists, Reliability was assessed with the kappa statistic as a measure of interrater agreement. Face validity was assessed through expert and patient judgment of the coding system. Content validity was examined by monitoring the incidence of unclassifiable requests. Construct validity was evaluated by examining the relationship between patient requests and patient health status; patient request fulfillment and patient satisfaction; and patient requests and physician perceptions of the visit.
   RESULTS. The 139 patients made 772 requests (619 requests for information and 153 requests for physician action). Average interrater agreement across a sample of 40 cases was 94% (kappa = 0.93; P < .001). Patients with better health status made fewer requests (r = -0.17; P = .048). Having more chronic diseases was associated with more requests for physician action (r = 0.32; P = .0002). Patients with more unfulfilled requests had lower visit satisfaction (r = -0.32; P < .001). More patient requests was also associated with physician reports of longer visit times (P = .016) and increased visit demands (P = .006).
   CONCLUSIONS, Our study provides evidence that TORP is a reliable and valid system for capturing and categorizing patients' requests in adult primary care. Further research is needed to confirm the system's validity, expand its applicability, and explore its usefulness as a tool for studying clinical negotiation.

TI  - Cartilage tympanoplasty in the treatment of adhesive otitis media with and without Eustachian tube balloon dilatation
T2  - JOURNAL OF OTOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Purpose: To compare cartilage tympanoplasty (CT) combined with eustachian tube balloon dilatation (ETBD) and cartilage tympanoplasty alone as a surgical treatment modality for adhesive otitis media (AdOM) in terms of graft healing, audiological outcomes, and impact on life style, using Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15). Methods: 50 patients with AdOM were randomly classified into 2 groups: 25 patients for cartilage tympanoplasty only (CT group) and 25 patients for cartilage tympanoplasty combined with eustachian tube balloon dilatation (CT + ETBD group). Clinical outcomes in both groups were compared at 3 and 6 months of follow up. Results: There was no significant difference in graft healing between the two groups. Postoperative COMOT-15 scores significantly decreased in both groups with a significant difference between the groups with regard to the decrease in COMOT-15 scores at 3 and 6 months of follow-up (P < 0.05). Hearing improvement was achieved, as the mean preoperative ABG was 26.5 +/- 5.4 and 27.1 +/- 4.6 dB, and the mean postoperative ABG at 6 months was 19.4 +/- 4.4 and 14.6 +/- 3.9 dB in the CT and the CT + ETBD groups, respectively. The difference in the magnitude of ABG reduction in the two groups was significant at 3 and 6 months of postoperative follow-up (P < 0.05) in favour of the CT + ETBD group. Conclusion: ETBD can increase the success rate of cartilage tympanoplasty in patients with AdOM by enhancing the audiological outcome and quality of life.

AB  - Background: Tinnitus is a common disease in public. It is not only associated with neuronal, muscular, vascular pathologies, but also with related psychological parameters. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between tinnitus, anxiety and depression in patients undergoing tympanoplasty.
   Methods: Patients with tinnitus and operated for chronic otitis media were included in our study. Before and after the operation, tinnitus handicap inventory, beck anxiety and depression scales were filled and pre- and postoperative values were compared. In addition, our patients were divided into two groups as tinnitus improve and did not improve and differences between them were investigated.
   Results: 148 patients were included in our study. Of 148 patients, 60 were male and 88 were female. There was no significant difference between the patients with and without tinnitus when the dermografic features, hearing levels and physical examination findings were compared.
   After the operation, the patients who did not improve tinnitus had higher levels of depression and depression than others (< 0.001).
   Conclusion: As a result of our study, anxiety and depression scales of the patients whose tinnitus did not improve were found to be higher than the patients whose tinnitus improved.

AB  - Background: Results and success measures of cholesteatoma surgery are generally described using objective data whereas subjective data are mostly lacking. Patients experiences and complaints are becoming more important alongside clinical and audiometric outcome measures in cholesteatoma care. Objective: To investigate the course of patient-reported complaints, the impact of complaints, audiometric measures and the stability of audiometric measures, and complaints over time after primary and recurrent/residual cholesteatoma surgery. Methods: Postoperative patients were prospectively included and divided into primary acquired and recurrent/residual cholesteatoma. The EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D-3L), Otology Questionnaire Amsterdam (OQUA), and the Speech Spatial Questionnaire (SSQ) were completed by 144 patients up to 2 years postoperative. Patient-reported complaints divided in eight separate domains, postoperative hearing and impact on daily life were longitudinally assessed by means of linear mixed models. Results: Hearing loss and tinnitus are the most reported postoperative complaints over time. Patient-reported loss of taste and the impact of all complaints decline over time. All other patient-reported complaints remain stable over time, only itch complaints fluctuate. Primary cholesteatoma patients score significantly higher on hearing loss complaints compared with recurrent/residual patients although they have comparable mean audiometric hearing loss. Furthermore, pure-tone hearing threshold, instead of asymmetric hearing loss, is correlated with the localization domain of the SSQ. Conclusion: This study provides important insights in the course of complaints and its impact on daily life after cholesteatoma surgery. Overall, the postoperative patient-reported complaints after cholesteatoma surgery are generally low in the studied population.

AB  - Objective: This systematic review aims to describe the impact of otologic surgery as a treatment for chronic otitis media (COM) on the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of adult patients.Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science until May 2023. Prospective studies including adult patients with COM (cholesteatoma) who underwent canal wall up mastoidectomy, canal wall down mastoidectomy, or tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy, with pre- and postoperative HRQoL measurements, were considered eligible. Questionnaire validation studies were excluded. The risk of bias and study quality were evaluated with a Quality Assessment Tool (for before-after studies with no control group). To assess the change in HRQoL, pre- and postoperative HRQoL values and absolute changes were extracted, synthesized, and presented in tables. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated to enhance comparisons.Results: Of the 720 studies identified, 16 met the inclusion criteria of this review. Different questionnaires were used throughout the studies. The CES and COMOT-15 were used in five studies and the ZCMEI-21 and COMQ-12 in three studies. All studies indicated statistically significant improvement in HRQoL from pre- to postoperative, measured with disease-specific HRQoL questionnaires. General HRQoL questionnaires did not show significant improvement. Calculated SMDs ranged from 0.24 to 6.99.Discussion and conclusion: Included studies had low (n = 10) to high (n = 6) risk of bias and poor (n = 4), fair (n = 7) or good (n = 5) study quality. Surgical treatment positively impacts the HRQoL of adult COM patients with and without cholesteatoma. However, the clinical relevance of the reported changes is unknown due to the lack of minimal clinically important differences (MCID) or cut-off values in each questionnaire. Therefore, further research regarding the MCIDs of each questionnaire is needed. Future research should also report preoperative chief symptoms and indications for surgery to improve individual patient counseling.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate the postoperative quality of life (QoL) after revision canal wall down mastoidectomy with mastoid obliteration (rCWD).
   Material and methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients treated by rCWD for cholesteatoma between 2016 and 2019. A control group including all patients treated by primary canal wall down with mastoid obliteration (pCWD) for cholesteatoma between 2009 and 2014 was used for the comparison of the postoperative QoL, assessed by the COMQ-12.
   Results: The rCWD and pCWD groups respectively counted 38 and 78 patients with an average follow-up of 30 and 62 months respectively. No significant difference was found in terms of QoL between the two groups. An intra-group analysis among rCWD patients, showed that patients treated by canal wall down (CWD) at the primary surgery had a significantly worse post-revision QoL compared to those initially treated by canal wall up (CWU), specifically in the hearing and balance domains of the questionnaire.
   Conclusions: Revision mastoid obliteration leads to similar QoL results to those obtained after primary CWD with obliteration. Patients who had undergone a CWD as primary surgery complain worse hearing and balance problems compared to those primarily submitted to CWU, even after revision surgery.

TI  - Teachers' theoretical orientations toward reading and pupil control ideology: A national survey
T2  - READING RESEARCH AND INSTRUCTION
LA  - English
KW  - MODEL
AB  - Based on a sun ev of Utah elementary teachers (Authors, 1997), a stratified three-stage cluster sample of 418 elementary school teachers (grades K-6) throughtout the United States was surveyed to examine relationships between their theoretical beliefs toward reading instruction and their attitudes about pupil control. Two survey instruments were combined for data collection: (a) the Theoretical Orientation to Reading Profile (TORP) (DeFord, 1985) which classifies reading orientations as phonics, skills, or whole language, and (b) the Pupil Control Ideology Form (PCI) (Willower, Eidell, & Hoy, 1967), which categorizes teacher attitudes about student control as custodial or humanistic. A Chi-square analysis showed a very strong relationship (p < 0.001), indicating that as teachers' scores moved toward the whole language end of the TORP scale, their PCI scores were mon humanistic. This result was not surprising, since both views share common progressive philosophical roots. Conversely, as teachers' reading orientations were classified as phonics and skills-based, their ideas of management were more custodial, a result that was anticipated since both views stem from behaviorist thought. Practical implications, comparisons with related studies, and possible areas for further research are discussed.

AB  - Background: After otorrhea and hearing loss, Tinnitus is the most common symptom in patients with chronic otitis media (COM). The aim of this study was to evaluate the improvement of tinnitus in COM patients after tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy surgeries. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted on COM patients suffering from Tinnitus referred to Baqiyatallah hospital, Tehran, Iran undergoing tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy surgeries between March 2013 and August 2014. Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) questionnaires were filled before and two months after surgery by each patient, and considered subjects were compared with each other. Audiometry test was taken from each patient before and two months after surgery. Audiometry results as well as Air-Bone gap were measured and evaluated prior and after surgery. Data were analyzed using SPSS software by ANOVA, sample t-test and Chi-square tests. Results: Eventually, 26 male and 24 female patients with a mean age of 38.62 +/- 11.88 years were enrolled. Air conduction at all frequencies was 49.99 +/- 17.37 before and 36.98 +/- 22.06 after surgery (P < 0.001). Severity of tinnitus was 62.92 +/- 30.54 before and 30.54 +/- 20.08 after surgery based on THI (P < 0.001). Also, it was 7.46 +/- 1.66 before and 3.5 +/- 2.06 after surgery based on VAS evaluations (P < 0.001). Tinnitus severity reduction was significantly associated with the improvement of hearing loss and decrement of air-Bone gap (P < 0.001). Tinnitus symptoms such as loudness, annoyance, impact on life and perception of Tinnitus significantly reduced after surgery. Moreover, Tympanomastoidectomy was more effective on the improvement of Tinnitus in comparison with Tympanoplasty (P = 0.019). Conclusion: It seems that, both tympanomastoidectomy and tympanoplasty surgeries are effective on the improvement of tinnitus in patients with COM; however, Tympanomastoidectom surgery was shown to be more effective.

AB  - Objective: Canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomies represent the most common cholesteatoma surgical techniques. In this meta-analysis, we compare the postoperative quality of life (QoL) in patients treated with either CWU or CWD mastoidectomy.Methods: A literature search was conducted in the following three electronic databases: Medline/PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Articles were assessed for eligibility in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement and data were extracted independently by two authors. Biases assessment was conducted for each study according to the Methodological Items for Non-Randomized Studies (MINORS) tool. Meta-analysis was performed for postoperative QoL following CWU versus CWD mastoidectomy.Results: Our systematic review included four studies that met the inclusion criteria, three prospective cohort studies, and one retrospective cohort study. The meta-analysis did not favor treatment with one of the two surgical techniques. Postoperative QoL did not show a statistically significant difference between CWU and CWD mastoidectomies (p > 0.05).Conclusion: Our systematic review and meta-analysis results indicate that QoL is not statistically significantly better among patients who underwent CWU mastoidectomies when compared with CWD. The trend of selecting CWU over CWD mastoidectomies in selected cases - for QoL purposes - is not always based on evidence-based data.

AB  - This study investigated the discriminant validation of the Test of Reading Performance (TORP), a new scale designed to evaluate the reading performance of elementary-school students. The sample consisted of 181 elementary-school students drawn from public elementary schools in northern Greece using stratified random procedures. The TORP was hypothesized to measure size constructs, namely: "letter knowledge," "phoneme blending," "word identification," "syntax," "morphology," and "passage comprehension." Suing standard deviations (SD) from the mean, three groups of students were formed as follows: A group of low achievers in reading (N = 9) including students who scored between 1 and -1.5 SD from the mean of the group. A group of students at risk of reading difficulties (N = 6) including students who scored between -1.5 and -2 SDs below the man of the group. A group of students at risk of serious reading difficulties (N = 6) including students who scored -2 or more SDs below the mean of the group. The rest of the students (no risk, N = 122) comprised the fourth group. Using discriminant analyses it was evaluated how well the linear combination of the 15 variables that comprised the TORP could discriminate students of different reading ability. Results indicated that correct classification rates for low achievers, those at risk for reading problems, those at risk of serious reading problems, and the no-risk group were 89%, 100%, 83%, and 97%, respectively. Evidence for partial validation of the TORP was provided through the use of confirmatory factor analysis and indices of sensitivity and specificity. It is concluded that the TORP can be utilized for the identification of children at risk for low achievement in reading. Analysis of the misclassified cases indicated that increased variability might have been responsible for the existing misclassification. More research is needed to determine the discriminant validation of TORP with samples of children with specific reading disabilities.

AB  - Introduction The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a serious exergame in improving the neuropsychiatric symptoms of patients with neurocognitive disorders. Methods X-Torp is a serious exergame combining motor and cognitive activities. Ninety-one subjects (mean age = 81.7 years, mean Mini-Mental State Examination = 18.3) were recruited in 16 centers. Centers were randomized into intervention and control centers. Subjects underwent assessment for cognitive and behavioral symptoms at baseline (BL), the end of the intervention (W12), and 12 weeks after the end of the intervention (W24). Results The comparison of neuropsychiatric symptoms between BL and W12 and W24 showed that subjects of the intervention group improved in apathy between BL and W12. Mixed analysis (time BL, W12, W24 x group) indicated a significant increase in apathy and neuropsychiatric symptoms in the control subjects. Discussion The use of X-Torp improved neuropsychiatric symptoms, particularly apathy. Future studies should more consistently use behavioral and neuropsychiatric symptoms as outcome measures.

TI  - Development of teachers' theoretical orientations toward reading and pupil control ideology
T2  - READING RESEARCH AND INSTRUCTION
LA  - English
AB  - A random sample of 437 elementary school teachers in the state of Utah was surveyed to examine relationships between theoretical beliefs toward reading instruction and attitudes about pupil control. Two survey instruments were combined for data collection: (a) The Theoretical Orientation to Reading Profile (TORP) (DeFord, 1985) which classifies reading orientations as phonics, skills, or whole language, and (b) The Pupil Control Ideology Form (PCI) (Willower, Eidell, & Hoy, 1967) which categorizes teacher attitudes about student control as custodial or humanistic. A significant, negative correlation (r = -.41, p < .0001) was found, indicating that as teachers' scores moved toward the whole language end of the TORP scale, their PCI scores were more humanistic, since both views share common progressive philosophical roots. Conversely, as teachers' reading orientations were classified as phonics and skills-based, their ideas of management were more custodial. Both views stem from behavioristic thought. Practical implications, comparisons with related studies, and possible areas for further research are discussed.

AB  - Background: We present the initial outcomes of transoral robotic parathyroidectomy (TORP) using the transoral vestibular approach in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Method: A retrospective case series analysis was performed on patients diagnosed with PHPT between October 2016 and July 2019 who underwent transoral robotic surgery for parathyroidectomy. Results: Thirteen patients (five males and eight females) successfully underwent TORP at our institution from October 2016 to July 2019. Eight patients underwent TORP alone, and five underwent TORP combined with transoral robotic thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma. No intra- or postoperative complications were observed. Serum levels of parathyroid hormone, total calcium, and ionized calcium decreased to normal postoperatively and continued to decrease during the follow-up period. Conclusion: This study suggests that TORP holds promise for the treatment of patients with PHPT with the advantages of the robotic procedure, including dynamic visualization and meticulous dissection.

AB  - Functional and subjective evaluation of 96 patients with CSOM following Tympanoplasty was conducted to assess health-related quality of life (HR-QOL). Many instruments are tried by various authors in evaluating relevant dimensions of HR-QOL. A prospective study was conducted to know the patient satisfaction and it is correlated with the Graft healing and audiological measurement. COMOT-15 parameter described by Baumann I, Kurpiers B, Plinkert PK, Praetorius M et al. was used in Indian scenario. It showed good correlation between the subscale hearing function from the COMOT-15 questionnaire and audiological findings. AIM: To prospectively evaluate subjective improvement in Health related Quality of Life and Disease specific Quality of Life in patients undergoing surgery for CSOM. To evaluate the relation between audiometric and psychometric measurements in post Tympanoplasty patients. The study also aims to audit the results of surgery in a surgeon's perspective of integration of the graft, prosthesis function and objective audiological improvement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 110 patients who underwent surgery for CSOM at Government General Hospital, Kurnool, attached to Kurnool Medical College, Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh were assessed with Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test (COMOT-15), Visual Analogue Scale, PTA, Closure of AB gap and otoscopic examination for evidence of graft healing and prosthesis function. The study was conducted between September 2011 and January 2014 and the patients were assessed at 6 months 12 months statistically analyzed to calculate the overall benefit to the patient. RESULTS: Use of multiple parameters like COMOT-15, Visual Analogue Scale, PTA and Closure of AB gap in assessing Tympanoplasty patients showed an easy and practicable method of evaluation with reliability. The test reliability coefficients was (all r> 0.6). Content validity was determined by a study of the literature. These tests can distinguish CSOM patients from healthy subjects. The responsiveness of the COMOT-15 questionnaire was good since it was translated in their mother tongue TELUGU. CONCLUSIONS: A Bidirectional approach to evaluate post-surgery patients for CSOM was a reliable, valid and sensitive with instruments for measurement of HR-QOL of CSOM patients. The results obtained with the questionnaire can be interpreted very well by the investigator. COMOT-15, VAS, PTA and AB gap closure can be used conveniently to audit the otological outcomes of research.

AB  - As a unique geological and geographical unit, the Tibetan Plateau dramatically impacts the world's environment and especially controls climatic and environmental changes in China, Asia and even in the Northern Hemisphere. Tibetan Plateau, therefore, provides a field laboratory for studying global change. With support from various agencies in the People's Republic of China, a Tibetan Observation and Research Platform (TORP) is now implementing. Firstly the background of the establishment of the TORP, the establishing and monitoring plan of long-term scale (5-10 years) of the TORP has been introduced. Then the preliminary observational analysis results, such as the characteristics of land surface heat fluxes and CO2 flux partitioning (diurnal variation and inter-monthly variation etc.), the characteristics of atmospheric and soil variables, the structure of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL) and the turbulent characteristics have also been shown in this paper.

AB  - Objectives/HypothesisTo determine the effect of otolaryngology trainee participation on clinical outcomes in patients who undergo endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS) for chronic rhinosinusitis.
   Study DesignSecondary analysis of prospectively collected data.
   MethodsPatients enrolled in a sinus surgery outcomes study between May 2011 and March 2013 were stratified into two groupsthose who were operated on by an attending alone and those operated on by an attending with a trainee present (resident, fellow, or both). Patients completed quality of life (QOL) surveys including the Chronic Sinusitis Survey (CSS), 22-item Sino-Nasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22), and EuroQol 5-dimension survey preoperatively and 1 year postoperatively. Operative time, estimated blood loss (EBL), complication rates, and survey scores were compared between groups.
   ResultsThe study population consisted of 452 patients. The attending alone (n=119) and trainee (n=333) groups were statistically comparable in terms of patient demographics, disease severity, and extent of surgery. Mean operative time was significantly shorter in the attending-alone group (80.0 vs. 90.6 minutes, P<.01). Mean EBL (105 mL attending vs. 117 mL trainee, P=.39) and complication rates (3.3% attending vs. 0.6% trainee, P=.07) were similar between groups. Observed changes in QOL measures following ESS were comparable between groups, although absolute improvement in the SNOT-22 scores (19.0 attending vs. 24.5 trainee, P=.05) did show a trend toward greater improvement in the trainee group.
   ConclusionsTrainee participation in ESS is associated with prolongation in surgical time; however, such participation was not found to adversely affect patient safety or clinical outcomes.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate what characteristics of tinnitus in patients with chronic otitis media was reduced after tympanoplasty and to assess the relationship between post-operative tinnitus reduction and pre-operative tinnitus tone, tinnitus duration, post-operative hearing recovery, and tympanogram. Medical records were prospective between March 2013 and May 2016. Audiologic evaluation by pure tone audiometry and acoustic impedance and tinnitus assessment using scores on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) was conducted preoperatively and 6 months post-operatively. The data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test, Student's and paired t test, and ANOVA. The pre-operative incidence of tinnitus in patients with COM was 47%. There was a very significant difference between pre-operative and post-operative mean THI scores (p < 0.05). Tinnitus was reduced or alleviated in 83% of tinnitus patients. Pre-operative low-tone tinnitus was significantly reduced 6 months after surgery. After surgery, air-conducted hearing improvement at 250, 500, and 1000 Hz in the tinnitus significant recovery group was greater than the tinnitus non-significant recovery group (p < 0.05). Tinnitus reduction in tympanogram A was significantly greater than in tympanograms B or C (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation between tinnitus duration and tinnitus reduction (p > 0.05). There was no significant effect of presence cholesteatoma and dry period on the gain THI (p > 0.05). The types of tympanoplasty had no effect on tinnitus improvement (p > 0.05). No patients experienced new tinnitus after surgery. Following tympanoplasty, most patients experienced a reduction in tinnitus. Pre-operative low-tone tinnitus is easier to reduce after tympanoplasty. Post-operative normal tympanogram and improved low-frequency AC hearing were important to tinnitus reduction.

AB  - BackgroundOtosclerosis is characterized by abnormal bone growth in the otie capsule. Nowadays, stapedotomy is commonly used for otosclerosis treatment. Currently, postoperative dizziness has been associated with stapedotomy. In 1981, intratympanic dexamethasone was utilized to manage inner ear disorders like tinnitus and acute sensorineural hearing loss. However, there is much uncertainty regarding the effect and safety of topical steroid therapy in the middle ear during stapedotomy. In the present study, we assessed the effect of topical steroid therapy during stapedotomy on postoperative dizziness.MethodsOtosclerosis patients eligible for stapedotomy were randomly divided into two groups based on dexamethasone administration or placebo. Audiometric and tympanometry results were observed and recorded for the involved frequencies. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory was used to quantify patient perceptions of dizziness and balance issues. Audiometry and dizziness assessments were repeated at discharge and 4 months after the operation.ResultsThe study comprised 72 otosclerosis patients undergoing stapedotomy. At discharge, the intervention group showed a significant reduction in the incidence of dizziness compared to the placebo group. However, in the 4-month follow-up after the operation, both groups experienced a decrease in dizziness incidence, with no significant difference between them. There was also no significant difference in audiometric levels between the two groups. Interestingly, the intervention group had a significantly lower need for systemic anti-dizziness drugs after surgery compared to the control group.ConclusionTopical dexamethasone during stapedotomy effectively minimizes dizziness at discharge and reduces the need for postoperative anti-dizziness medication.Level of evidence2.
   Topical dexamethasone during surgery reduces post-stapedotomy dizziness, the need for systemic anti-dizziness medication during hospitalization, and shortens hospital stay. image

AB  - PurposeEndoscopic type I tympanoplasty was originally introduced in the 1990s and the extensive spread of this practice can be easily observed. The conventional technique performed involves the repair of a tympanic membrane perforation and is defined as microscopic type I tympanoplasty. The aim of this study is the comparison of quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes with endoscopic to that with microscopic type I tympanoplasty.MethodsAll patients, or in the case of children with the aid of a parent, were asked to complete a novel QoL questionnaire drafted by our study group. The analysis was performed with descriptive statistics-mean, SD and relative frequency-and with a mixed model (generalized least squares fit). A two-sided p value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.ResultsA total of 83 patients completed the questionnaire, 38 in the endoscopic group and 45 in the microscopic group. Every question represented a different. A statistically significant result was found in favor of the endoscopic approach regarding average hospitalization rate (p = 0.003) and cosmetic outcomes (p = 0.015). No statistically significant difference was otherwise observed between the groups.ConclusionsBased on our prospective cohort study, the QoL outcomes of endoscopic type I tympanoplasty in terms of postoperative pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, taste disorder and hearing were comparable to the microscopic type I tympanoplasty. In regard to cosmetics, an increase in desirable results was achieved in the endoscopic group, particularly the average hospitalization rate proved to be statistically significantly lower than in the microscopic group.

AB  - Otosclerosis is a well-known disease which mainly affects middle-aged female patients, causing conductive or mixed hearing loss. Diagnosis is essentially made through a complete audiometric battery testing, while treatment substantially relies on stapes surgery. In this study, we analyzed audiometric and Quality-of-Life data from 33 patients in order to refine the surgical indications (unilateral versus bilateral stapes surgery) and assess the best technique (stapedotomy versus partial stapedectomy) and timing of treatment. The original questionnaire OTOS, in the Italian language, was administered to all patients. In this study, most of the patients were female (18/33), with a mean age of 53 years old. Both surgical techniques appear to be effective with no significant difference in post-operative Air Bone Gap. OTOS questionnaire appeared to be effective in assessing quality of life in patients treated by stapes surgery. Post-operative QoL appeared to be similar in bilaterally and unilaterally operated patients, suggesting that a contralateral intervention after effective surgery should be undertaken only if expressly requested by the patient.

AB  - Chronic Otitis Media (COM) is a major indication for tympanoplasty. It is important to predict the outcome of surgery and give proper counselling for the patient. This avoids untoward expectations. To measure the outcome of patients who underwent tympanoplasty for mucosal type of chronic otitis media (COM) using Middle ear risk index (MERI) score. Any possible correlation of MERI score with outcomes? Assess quality-of-life. Prospective analytical comparative cohort study. Sample size was 75. All patients underwent tympanoplasty for mucosal type of COM with hearing loss. The patients were categorised into mild, moderate and severe groups based on the MERI score. The hearing benefit was calculated from the pre- and post-op difference in PTA. The graft uptake status was graded. The relation between MERI score, graft status and hearing benefit were analysed and compared. QOL was assessed by COMOT-15 questionnaire. Patients with a high MERI score had lower rate of graft uptake, whereas, patients with mild MERI had greater hearing benefit and those with severe MERI had lesser hearing benefit postoperative. MERI score is a prognostic tool to predict the outcome of tympanoplasty. It has an inverse relation with graft uptake and hearing benefit. Based on MERI score, the chances for surgical success and hearing benefit could be explained to the patient to give them realistic expectations.

AB  - Introduction Tinnitus is experienced by a significant part of the patients suffering from otosclerosis.
   Objective To assess the prevalence of tinnitus in otosclerosis, its main features, and the impact on the daily life.
   Methods Patients diagnosed with otosclerosis in 2019 in a tertiary hospital were enrolled in the study. Demographic data were retrieved and, besides a regular audiometric evaluation, the patients underwent acuphenometry to assess the psychoacoustic measurements (pitch and loudness), and the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI).
   Results In total, 66 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria, with a female predominance (63.6%; n = 42), and a mean age of 48.7 years. The mean air-bone gap was of 26.3 dB. A total of 72.7% complained of tinnitus; it was mostly unilateral, identified in the low frequencies, namely 500 Hz, with median loudness of 7.5 dB. The median score on the THI score was of 37; most patients had a mild handicap (33.3%, n = 16), followed by those with a severe handicap (22.9%; n = 11). The female gender had a statistically significant association with the presence of tinnitus. The THI scores were higher in middle-aged patients (age groups: 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years), which was statistically significant. No correlation was found between audiometry results and the prevalence of tinnitus or score on the THI. On the other hand, high-pitched tinnitus, compared to low pitched-tinnitus, was associated with larger air-bone gaps.
   Conclusion The prevalence of tinnitus in our population was in line with the prevalences reported in the literature. It caused a catastrophic handicap in 22.9% of the patients. High-pitched tinnitus was associated with higher handicap. Nonetheless, the existence of tinnitus and its severity were not associated with the degree of hearing loss.

AB  - Temporalis fascia is being used as graft material for tympanic membrane repair for over six decades. Though cartilage with or without perichondrium is also being used for different situations, still temporalis fascia graft is being considered as an ideal graft for tympanoplasty. Earlier the dried temporalis fascia was used as a graft but now freshly taken wet temporalis fascia is increasingly being used as a more 'physiological/ live' graft. The present study was planned to compare the results of use of wet and dry temporalis fascia in chronic otitis media mucosal disease. The prospective study was conducted on 100 patients of chronic suppurative otitis media mucosal disease. Chronic ear survey questionnaire were filled to note the impact on quality of life. Otoscopic, oto-endoscopic and examination under microscope performed. Patients were allocated into two groups alternately. Freshly taken wet temporalis graft was used in group I whereas dry temporalis fascia was used in group II. Hearing evaluation by pure tone audiogram was done preoperatively and at 6th months post-operatively. Pre-operative and post-operative hearings in both the groups were compared. Air bone gap closures after surgery in between both the groups were compared to see for any statistical difference. We found similar graft uptake in both the groups after 6 months of surgery. The air bone gap closure in group I was 10.80 +/- 5.74 and group II was 9.28 +/- 4.81, there was no significant difference. However senior authors noted that in some of the cases in group I with fresh wet graft placement neo-tympanum formation was noticed early showing good circumferential leash of blood vessels all around signifying early vascularisation.

AB  - Objective: To investigate a pathology of conductive hearing loss caused by an incomplete ossicular discontinuity. It can manifest as a triad of the following: 1) conductive hearing loss most prominent in the high frequencies (hfCHL), defined as [ABG for 4 kHz] > [mean ABG for 0.25-0.5 kHz] + 10 dB or more; 2) fluctuating hearing loss; and 3) short-lasting improvement of hearing after Valsalva maneuver.
   Study Design: Retrospective clinical trial.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: Fourteen patients with an incomplete ossicular discontinuity who underwent incus interposition were included.
   Intervention: Incus interposition, mathematical model.
   Main Outcome Measures: First, the prevalence of the triad was documented. Second, the hypothesis that mechanical ossicular compliance was responsible for the triad of symptoms was evaluated and simulated in a mathematical model. Finally, the postoperative hearing results with a follow-up of 12 months were analyzed and compared with those reported in the literature.
   Results: The presence of the triad of symptoms is a strong indicator for detecting patients with an incomplete ossicular discontinuity. High frequency conductive hearing loss was present in 93% (13/14 patients). Ten (71%) of the 14 patients presented with fluctuating hearing loss and improvement of hearing after Valsalva maneuver. The hfCHL could be simulated adequately in the mathematical model. Success rate for surgical intervention (ABG < 20 dB; 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) was 93% and was comparable to the results reported in the literature.
   Conclusion: Patients with hfCHL, fluctuating hearing loss, and improvement of hearing after Valsalva maneuver are likely to have an incomplete ossicular discontinuity. A favorable postoperative hearing recovery by incus interposition can be expected.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate operative comfort and stress in patients undergoing stapedotomy for otosclerosis under local versus general anesthesia.
   Material and methods: Consecutive otosclerosis patients managed over a 9-month period responded to 3 validated questionnaires to assess peri- and post-operative comfort: Glasgow Benefit Inventory, Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale. These results and audiometric data were compared between local and general anesthesia groups.
   Results: Twenty-one patients were included in the local anesthesia group and 7 in the general anesthesia group, after exclusion of patients with history of otosclerosis surgery. There was no significant inter-group difference on Glasgow Benefit Inventory (P = 0.38) or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (P = 0.86). Perceived Stress Scale scores were higher in the general anesthesia group (P = 0.038). In total, 67% of patients reported no discomfort under local anesthesia, and 86% were ready to undergo the procedure under local anesthesia again. There were no significant differences in postoperative symptoms, or in air-bone gap = 10 dB (local anesthesia 81%, general anesthesia 71%; P = 0.156).
   Conclusions: Local anesthesia in otosclerosis surgery did not increase stress or postoperative symptoms compared to general anesthesia. Audiometric results were not affected by type of anesthesia. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Objective. The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of endoscopic cartilage myringoplasty (ECM) with or without plasma radiofrequency (RF) tuboplasty (PRT) for repairing chronic large perforation with Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). Materials and methods. Chronic large perforations with ETD were randomly divided into receiving ECM or ECM plus PRT. During the 24 months follow-up, the Eustachian tube score (ETS), Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire-7 (ETDQ-7), ET inflammation scale, hearing results, and graft success rate of the patients were analyzed. Results. A total of 61 subjects were included in the study. Difference of ETS was significant before and after surgery in the ECM + PRT group (P < .05) but the ECM group was not (P > .05). Also, significant between-group difference was found regardless of post-24 months ETS and improvement value. Postoperative ETDQ-7 scores were significantly reduced compared with preoperative ETDQ-7 scores in both groups (P < .05), also, significant between-group difference was found regardless of post-24 months ETDQ-7 scores and improvement value. The graft success rate was 86.7% in the ECM group and 96.8% in the ECM + PRT group at postoperative 24 months (P > .05). In addition, although the ECM + PRT group showed a better air-bone gap improvement than the ECM group, the difference was not significant (13.01 +/- 2.97 vs 10.92 +/- 0.69 dB; P > .05). No PRT procedure-related serious adverse events were reported during the follow-up process. No patients developed atelectasis or otitis media with effusion in either group. Conclusion. ECM combined with low-temperature PRT did not affect the graft success rate but showed a better long-term improvement in ETS and ETDQ-7 than cartilage myringoplasty for the treatment of chronic perforation with ETD. In addition, although PRT showed a better hearing improvement, the difference was not significant between the 2 groups.

AB  - Introduction: Malleus, Incus and Stapes are the three middle ear ossicles which form an articulated chain and help in conduction of sound from external ear to inner ear. Morphometric study of these ossicles has been going since the early 60s. Although the methods of been changing due to advent of newer technologies and treatments.
   Methods: We studied ossicles of 60 temporal bones. The ossicles have been obtained by 'canal wall down' mastoidectomy technique. They have been measured by an open software, Fiji (https://imagej.nih.gov ) where the scale was standardized and set to mm (millimeter).
   Results: The mean total length of the malleus is 8.23 mm; a mean angle of 128.76 degrees, mean width of the head 2.56 mm, and mean length of manubrium is 4.17 mm. The mean total length of incus is 7.04 mm, mean angle of 97.23 degrees, mean total width of 5.31 mm, and mean length of long process is 3.27 mm. The mean total height of stapes is 3.44 mm; mean width of the footplate is 1.10 mm and a mean angle of 51.01 degrees.
   Discussion: Morphometric data obtained in the present study can be useful for the reconstructive procedures. Preoperative radiological assessment is advised for these small bones. The present study also emphasizes on the future directions where in reconstructive procedures can be improved with the artistic renderings of the blueprints provided, for new prosthetic designs which can be manufactured by using Teflon materials.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the Effect of concurrent nasal surgery on the eustachian tube function (ETF) and myringoplasty outcomes for the chronic perforations with coexistent nasal pathology.
   Materials and methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of 93 patients with perforations who underwent same-day myringoplasty and nasal-septal surgery. Group A exhibited septal deviations (n = 34) and Group B inflammatory sinus disease (n = 59). Groups were compared with respect to pre- and postoperative air-bone gaps (ABGs), graft success rates and ETF (Eustachian tube score [ETS] and seven-item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire [ETDQ-7]) at 6 and 24 months. Results: Graft success rates were 100.0% in Group A and 98.3% in Group B at 6 months postoperatively (P = 0.445). Graft success rates were 85.3% in Group A and 96.6% in Group B at 24 months postoperatively (P = 0.046), the re-perforation rate was significantly higher in Group A than in Group B (P = 0.015). Although the preoperative ETS was similar between two groups, the postoperative ETS in the Group B was significantly higher compared with Group A regardless of at postoperative 6th and 24th months. In addition, difference was significant for the patients with positive Valsalva maneuver among two groups at postoperative 24th months. Also, the improvement in the ETDQ-7 score in the B group was significantly higher than that in the A group at postoperative 6th and 24th months.
   Conclusions: Concurrent nasal surgery and myringoplasty is feasible. In addition, ESS improves ETF and thus long-term outcomes of myringoplasty for the chronic perforations with inflammatory sinus disease.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to compare the outcomes of endoscopic cartilage underlay myringoplasty(CNM) with or without balloon Eustachian tuboplasty (BET) for the treatment of chronic perforation with Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD). Materials and methods: A total of 50 ears diagnosed with chronic perforation and ETD were randomly divided into receiving alone CNM and CNM + BET. During the 12 months follow-up, the Eustachian tube score (ETS), Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire-7 (ETDQ-7), ET inflammation scale, hearing results and graft success rate of the patients were recorded and analyzed. Results: The improvement in the ETDQ-7 score was 6.23 +/- 2.51 in the CNM + BET group, which was significantly higher than that in the CNM group (4.22 +/- 3.85, P < 0.01) at postoperative 3 months, however, no significant between-group difference was found at post-12 months. The graft success rate was 88.0% in the CNM group and 92.0 % in the CNM + BET group at postoperative 3 months (P > 0.05). Also, no significant difference was found among two groups (84.0 % vs 88.0 %, P > 0.05).The ABG improvement was 13.16 +/- 3.19 dB in the CNM + BET group and 9.74 +/- 2.56 dB in the CNM group, with a statistically significant between-group difference (P < 0.01) at postoperative 3 months. However, no significant between-group difference was found at postoperative 12 months. During followup process, neither complications nor patulous symptoms were noted. No patients developted atelectasis or otitis media with effusion. However, myringitis was seen in 8 % patients in the CNM group and 12 % patients in the CNM + BET group. Conclusions: Although BET combined with endoscopic cartilage myringoplasty had better short-term improvement of hearing and ETDQ-7 scores compared with endoscopic cartilage myringoplasty for the treatment of chronic large perforation with ETD, the long-term outcomes was not satisfactory. Also, BET did not improve the 3-and 12 months graft success rate.

AB  - Background: The use of Serious exerGames (SeG) as enriched environments (EE), which promotes cognitive simulation with physical activity in a positive emotional context, has been proposed to represent a powerful method to slow down the decline due to neurodegenerative diseases (ND), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, so far, no SeG targeting EE has been tested in ND subjects.
   Objective: This study aimed at evaluating the usability and short-term training effects of X-Torp, an action SeG designed for elderly ND subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.
   Methods: X-Torp is a SeG played using the Microsoft (R) Kinect (TM). 10 ND subjects and 8 healthy elderly controls (HEC) were enrolled in a 1-month program with three training sessions per week. Usability was evaluated through game time, game performance, the aerobic intensity level reached, perceived emotions, and perceived usability.
   Results: All participants successfully completed the training program. ND subjects played less and had a lower game performance compared to HEC. During the sessions, ND subjects maintained a light intensity of aerobic activity, while HEC maintained a moderate intensity. Both groups experienced only positive emotions, and reported a 'moderate' to 'high' perceived competence, a 'moderate' game difficulty, and a 'high' interest in the game.
   Conclusion: Usability results suggest that X-Torp represents a usable EE for healthy subjects and persons with MCI and AD. However, in order to reach moderate or high intensity of aerobic activity, X-Torp control modes should be adapted to become more physically stimulating.

AB  - The Tibetan Plateau, with the most prominent and complicated terrain on the globe and an elevation of more than 4,000 m, on average, above sea level, is very important in Asian monsoon circulation and global climate change. The lack of quantitative understanding of interactions between the land surface and atmosphere makes it difficult to model the complete energy and water cycles over the Tibetan Plateau and their effects on global climate change. Therefore, the number of atmosphere-land interaction studies over the Tibetan Plateau has increased in recent years. But experiments have been limited by observational parameters, and most investigations have only been done in summer and at a few locations. With support from various agencies in the People's Republic of China, a Tibetan Observation and Research Platform (TORP) is now focusing on land-surface processes and the environment over the plateau, with an emphasis on atmosphere-land interaction. We show the background and the progress of TORPs long-term monitoring plan (5-10 years), as well as present the TORP data policy and the uses of TORP data. (Page 1487)

AB  - Objectives: The main study endpoint was tolerance of stapedotomy under local anesthesia with seda-tion and under general anesthesia using stress and quality of life assessment questionnaires. Secondary endpoints comprised operative time and functional results. Material and method: In a consecutive series of stapedotomy patients operated on over a 12-month period, quality of life and perioperative stress were analysed by 3 questionnaires: the Glasgow Benefit Inven-tory, Cohen's perceived stress scale and the Post-traumatic stress disorder checklist scale. Questionnaire responses and audiometric data were compared between groups treated under local anesthesia with sedation and under general anesthesia. Results: Twenty-two patients were included in the local anesthesia with sedation group and 6 in the general anesthesia group. There was no difference between the groups for quality of life, onset of post-traumatic stress, or perceived pre-and postoperative stress. There was also no difference in operative time. The audiometric data confirmed the reliability of stapedotomy. Stapedotomy under local anesthesia with sedation improved air conduction with < 10 dB air-bone gap (ABG), comparable to results under general anesthesia. The rate of ABG < 10 dB was 71.4%; no labyrinthisation was observed. Conclusion: Under local anesthesia with sedation, stapedotomy was well tolerated without increasing the stress associated with otosclerosis surgery. By correcting hearing loss, the procedure improves quality of life. (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: To analyse the anatomical, functional and quality-of-life results when using bioactive glass in mastoid and epitympanic obliteration.
   Design: Prospective clinical study.
   Setting: Tertiary referral centre.
   Participants: Forty-one cases (39 patients) operated between May 2013 and January 2015.
   Main outcome measures: Anatomical results were evaluated by otomicroscopy 1 year after surgery and using imaging to detect residual disease. Functional results were studied by postoperative hearing gain. Quality of life was assessed with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory questionnaire and the success of surgery by a surgery-specific questionnaire.
   Results: At 1 year, all patients presented a well-healed external auditory canal, with an intact tympanic membrane. In cases with cholesteatoma (n = 23), no recurrent retraction pockets or residual disease were observed on imaging studies. The overall air-bone gap closure was 7.7 +/- 1.84 dB (mean +/- SE of the mean, P < 0.001, paired t-test). No significant differences were found on hearing results when comparing primary versus revision surgery, canal-wall-up versus canal-wall-down obliterations, type of tympanoplasty and presence of cholesteatoma (multifactor ANOVA). The Glasgow Benefit Inventory improved with an average score of 28 and the success of surgery questionnaire showed a significant improvement in ear discharge and a moderate improvement in hearing and equilibrium.
   Conclusions: The use of bioactive glass for mastoid and epitympanic obliteration in canal-wall-down or canal-wall-up tympanoplasties is an effective procedure in both primary and revision surgery. The anatomical and functional results appear to be well correlated with patient experience and to the improvement in quality of life.

AB  - Objective: According to the literature, between 40 and 90% of otosclerosis patients suffering from hearing loss also suffer from tinnitus on the affected side. For a lot of these patients tinnitus represents a handicap that is just as debilitating as the hearing loss itself. The main goal of the surgical treatment of otosclerosis is a significant improvement in hearing loss, but frequent reports of reduced tinnitus after surgery suggest that this can be a positive side effect.
   Methods: All patients who underwent stapedotomy were initially included in the study. Retrospectively, the tinnitus questionnaire as compiled by Goebel and Hiller was sent to the patients, and 34 patients (37 ears) replied. The pre- and postoperative cases of tinnitus were divided into compensated and non-compensated tinnitus. In addition the following tinnitus-related factors were evaluated: emotional, cognitive and mental burden; intrusiveness of the tinnitus; hearing problems; somatic ailments; and sleep disturbances.
   Results: Over 80% of the patients surveyed suffered from tinnitus pre-operation. The tinnitus disappeared or improved in over 60% of the cases after stapedotomy. In addition, the related factors surveyed also improved appreciably post surgery and reached a significant level in patients with compensated tinnitus.
   Conclusion: Besides a significant improvement in hearing loss the intensity and the psychosomatic burden of a pre-operative tinnitus can be reduced by stapedotomy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aims To demonstrate the non-inferiority of perioperative comfort in patients undergoing otosclerosis surgery under local anesthesia versus general anesthesia and to compare audiometric results, quality of life and complications. Materials and methods A prospective non-interventional study was performed. Patients undergoing otosclerosis surgery between January 2019 and March 2021 at the University Hospital of Rennes were included consecutively. Perioperative comfort of LA versus GA (at ward admission, surgery, recovery and 48 h following surgery) was measured on a visual analogue scale at 10 days postoperatively and quality of life by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory at 3 months. Complications and audiometric results were also assessed. To demonstrate the non-inferiority of LA versus GA with a margin of 1.5 points on the comfort VAS, a power of 80% and a first-order risk of 5, 100 patients were included and statistical analyses were performed in accordance with CONSORT2010 statement. Results One hundred ears were analyzed, 46% operated under local anesthesia and 54% under general anesthesia. The two groups were similar in terms of demographic and pathological characteristics. Local anesthesia was non-inferior to general anesthesia in terms of comfort with a comfort VAS of 8.74 +/- 1.55 and 9.08 +/- 0.93 respectively (p < 0.0001). There were no significant differences in rates of complications, audiometric results and quality of life between local and general anesthesia. Conclusion Local anesthesia is non-inferior to general anesthesia in terms of perioperative patient comfort with similar audiometric results, postoperative quality of life and complication rates.

AB  - Purpose This study aimed to conduct a comparative analysis of audiological and postoperative clinical outcomes between the endoscopic and microscopic stapedotomy approaches. Methods This study employed a randomized, controlled design. Twenty-seven patients with bilateral otosclerosis underwent stapedotomy in both ears, with randomized allocation of the surgical technique (endoscopic vs. microscopic) for the first operated ear. Air-bone gap (ABG) and ABG gain were measured at least 12 months postoperatively. Postoperative outcomes including pain (Visual Analog Scale-VAS), dizziness, early-term (day 1) and late-term (6 months) dysgeusia were evaluated. The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) assessed health-related quality of life at one month postoperatively, and operative time was measured. Results This study compared endoscopic (n = 27 ears) and microscopic (n = 27 ears) stapedotomy for otosclerosis. Both groups achieved similar hearing improvement with no significant differences in pre-operative and post-operative bone/air conduction thresholds, ABG, and ABG gain (all p > 0.05). The endoscopic stapedotomy group demonstrated reduced postoperative pain (lower VAS scores, p < 0.001), lower early dysgeusia (3.7% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.005), shorter operative time (47.3 vs. 75.4 min, p < 0.001) and improved patient-reported outcomes (higher GBI score, p = 0.014) when compared to microscopic stapedotomy group. No significant differences were observed in postoperative dizziness or late-term dysgeusia between groups. Conclusion This study found similar hearing improvement with both endoscopic and microscopic stapedotomy for otosclerosis. However, the endoscopic approach showed advantages in reduced postoperative pain, early dysgeusia, and operative time, with improved patient-reported quality of life. These findings suggest endoscopic stapedotomy as a valuable alternative to the conventional microscopic approach.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the long-term safety and performance of four different vibroplasty couplers (round window, oval window, CliP and Bell coupler) in combination with an active middle ear implant. Methods: This was a multicentre, prospective, long-term study including 5 German hospitals. Thirty adult subjects suffering from conductive or mixed hearing loss were initially enrolled for the study, 24 of these were included in the final analysis with up to 36 months of postsurgical follow-up data. Bone conduction and air conduction were measured pre- and postoperatively to evaluate safety. Postoperative aided sound field thresholds and Freiburger monosyllable word recognition scores were compared to unaided pre-implantation results to confirm performance. Additional speech tests compared postoperative unaided with aided results. To determine patient satisfaction, an established quality-of-life questionnaire developed for conventional hearing aid usage was administered to all subjects. Results: Mean postoperative bone conduction thresholds remained stable throughout the whole study period. Mean functional gain for all couplers investigated was 38.5 +/- 11.4 dB HL (12 months) and 38.8 +/- 12.5 dB HL (36 months). Mean word recognition scores at 65 dB SPL increased from 2.9% in the unaided by 64.2% to 67.1% in the aided situation. The mean postoperative speech reception in quiet (or 50% understanding of words in sentences) shows a speech intelligibility improvement at 36 months of 17.8 +/- 12.4 dB SPL over the unaided condition. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improved by 5.9 +/- 7.2 dB SNR over the unaided condition. High subjective device satisfaction was reflected by the International Inventory for Hearing Aids scored very positively. Conclusion: A significant improvement was seen with all couplers, and audiological performance did not significantly differ between 12 and 36 months after surgery. (C) 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - This study aims to determine the benefit of stapes surgery for otosclerosis in 121 patients with a mixed hearing loss and a preoperative bone conduction (BC) threshold >30 dB. Average postoperative air conduction (AC) improved from 61.5 dB to 34.3 dB. Average air-bone gap closed from 27.1 dB to 6.1 dB. Bone conduction improved from 34.3 dB to 28.2 dB, with 38% of patients achieving a postoperative AC of <30 dB. Glasgow Benefit Inventory scores showed significantly increased quality of life postoperatively in the 88 patients who responded to follow-up, with an average score of 56. There was a mean reduction in daily hearing aid use postsurgery of 5.48 hours, with 56% of patients who responded to follow-up questionnaire no longer needing to use one. When assessing suitability for stapes surgery, surgeons should consider that preoperative BC thresholds may be a poor indicator of the true cochlear reserve and therefore the potential for improvement in AC thresholds and quality of life.

AB  - PurposeTo investigate the short-term efficacy of third-generation bisphosphonate in the management of tinnitus associated with otosclerosis.MethodsA prospective case-control study included 100 patients with otosclerosis-associated bothersome tinnitus. Patients were assigned to two groups: group A (control): 25 patients who planned to receive only complementary supplements, oral vitamin D plus calcium, and group B (case): 75 patients who planned to receive oral bisphosphonate plus routine vitamin D and calcium supplements. Group B was subdivided into B1: 25 patients without any previous intervention, B2: 25 patients with persistent tinnitus for more than 6 months after a previous uncomplicated stapedotomy in the same ear, and B3: 25 patients with persistent tinnitus for more than 6 months after hearing aid fitting. The outcome was tinnitus assessment both subjectively (tinnitus intensity, frequency, and questionnaire) and objectively (tinnitus intensity and frequency).ResultsThe female-to-male ratio was 1.6:1 with ages ranging from 40 to 61 years. The baseline revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups. After 6 months, there were statistically significant differences, both objectively and subjectively. The tinnitus questionnaire median (IQR) for group B was 16 (30), whereas control group A had 52 (24). The tinnitus severity median (IQR) for group B was 20 (30), compared to group A's 52 (42). After 6 months, 40% of the cases in group B demonstrated complete improvement, compared to 0% in control group A.ConclusionWe demonstrated significant tinnitus improvement in cases treated with bisphosphonate compared to the control group.

AB  - Background: Chronic otitis media (COM) remains a major public health issue and is associated with relentless discharge from the ear, pain, significant functional limitation of hearing, leading to communication problems and frequent specialist visits. Aims: To assess the improvement in quality of life of patients of COM (safe type) and surgical success in terms of graft uptake and improvement in hearing. Patients and Methods: A prospective questionnaire-based outcome study was directed in 100 patients with COM who were treated with Type I Tympanoplasty at our institution between May 2018 and May 2020. All patients were asked to fill Modified Chronic Otitis Media 4 (COM-4) survey before operation and 3 months after operation. Preoperative and postoperative total ear scores, audiological results, postoperative graft uptake were assessed. Results: The correlation between preoperative and postoperative assessment by questionnaire was statistically critical (P < 0.001). There was significant improvement in hearing postoperatively (P < 0.001). Effective graft uptake was seen in 80%. Conclusion: The current study emphasizes that Type 1 Tympanoplasty fundamentally improves quality of life of patients in terms of physical suffering, hearing loss. emotional distress postoperatively.

AB  - Introduction: Otosclerosis is the primary cause of conductive hearing loss with normal otoscopy. As the condition worsens, certain patients may develop a sensorineural component. Patients with successful surgeries may still need hearing aids, which creates a dilemma for health professionals as there are insufficient data to make informed decisions. This study investigated the influence of the surgeon's proficiency level, individual patient factors (e.g., age at the time of intervention and survival rates), and surgery costs on the cost-effectiveness of stapes surgery. Methods: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using an adapted Markov model incorporating annual all-cause mortalities. In addition, we introduced sensitivity analyses to address the effects of surgical expertise on adults with bilateral conductive hearing loss due to otosclerosis. A model was developed based on a decision tree with treatment options and complication scenarios for otosclerosis patients undergoing stapes surgery or receiving hearing aids. Annual all-cause mortality was considered. A sensitivity analysis was performed assigned to different training levels ("experts" and "less experienced") to simulate the effects of surgical experience on the cost-effectiveness of surgical outcomes. Successful surgery was defined as closing of the air-bone gap to 10 dB or less. Based on published data, "experts" were simulated with a 93.7% success rate, and "less experienced" were manufactured with a 68.9% success rate. Results: Stapes surgery provides improved quality of life (QoL) compared to hearing aids with lower cumulative costs up to 87 years of age in the case of "expert" surgeons and up to 78 years of age, when performed by "less experienced" surgeons. Conclusions: Primary stapes surgery is highly cost-effective and delivers improved QoL compared to hearing aids with lower cumulative costs. Additionally, undergoing stapes surgical training remains highly cost-effective.

AB  - Lignin, an abundant biomass waste, was degraded under microwave irradiation with H(2)O(2)as the oxidant and metalloporphyrin as the catalyst. The effect of substituent group (4-methylphenyl, 4-methoxyphenyl, 4-bromophenyl and 4-carboxyphenyl) at themeso-benzene ring of metalloporphyrin, central metal ion (Co, Mn, Ni and Fe) and axial ligand (chlorine,p-hydroxypyridine,p-pyridinecarboxaldehyde) on the degradation of lignin was investigated. The electron-withdrawing group not only reduces the electron cloud density on the porphyrin ring, but also promotes the formation of higher active intermediate [(Porp)Me-IV=O](+center dot). Therefore, the presence of stronger electron-withdrawing substituents makes the metalloporphyrins more efficient in lignin degradation. Compared to Co porphyrin, there are less amount of [(Porp)Me-IV=O](+)center dot formed when Mn, Fe or Ni porphyrin was used as the catalyst for degrading lignin. Consequently, Co porphyrin contributed to a higher YAM (the yield of aromatic monomers). The strong nucleophilicity and the low steric hinderance of axial ligand was advantageous for the stability of metalloporphyrins, which is favorable for improving the catalytic activity to the degradation of lignin. It is found that the YAM increases 20.1% from 5.6% by using CoTBrPPCl as the reaction catalyst under the optimized conditions

AB  - Hemin has attracted considerable interest as an efficient catalyst recently, however, its direct application is inefficient due to severe molecular aggregation. Immobilizing hemin on various supports is a feasible approach to address this issue. In this work, a CNTs-hemin catalyst was prepared by loading hemin onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through ball milling. Compared with hemin, CNTs-hemin demonstrates remarkably enhanced performance in the peroxymonosulfate system, with a 650-fold improvement of apparent rate constant, reaching 97.8% degradation of sulfathiazole in 5 min. High-valent iron-oxo porphyrin cation ((Porp)+???FeIV=O) radicals are proposed as the dominant reactive species in the CNTs-hemin/peroxymonosulfate system instead of sulfate radicals (SO4???-), hydroxyl radicals (???OH), superoxide radicals (O2???-) and singlet oxygen (1O2). More in-depth mechanisms reveal that the strong electron transfer between CNTs and hemin promotes the generation of (Porp)+???FeIV=O radicals through a heterolysis pathway. This research enriches the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of supported biomimetic catalysts for PMS activation and provides a perspective on the role of support materials for catalytic activity.

AB  - Objective: To study objective or subjective preoperative factors predicting improvement in listening capabilities and patient satisfaction after stapes surgery in otosclerosis.
   Study Design: Prospective, multicenter study.
   Setting: Two tertiary referral centers.
   Patients: Fifty-four consecutive adult patients with otosclerosis.
   Interventions: Stapedotomy, stapedectomy.
   Main Outcome Measures: Pure tone and speech audiometry and questionnaires were assessed preoperatively and repeated 6 months postoperatively. The questionnaires consisted of a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-10) to score the overall quality of life, and the Operation Benefit Profile to assess the listening capability in various circumstances. Stereophony, defined by the Belfast rule of thumb, was used to divide the patients in 3 categories having unilateral, symmetric bilateral, or asymmetric bilateral hearing loss.
   Results: Six patients were considered early failures of surgery, and 8 patients were lost to follow-up. In the remaining 40 patients (43 ears), all audiometric parameters improved significantly. The postoperative air-bone gap was less than 10 dB in 70%. The postoperative average air conduction threshold was less than 30 dB in 49%. The postoperative quality of life was excellent (VAS, >= 9) in 45% and did not correlate with any preoperative parameter. Preoperative and postoperative overall listening capabilities correlated slightly (Spearman r, 0.47). The postoperative VAS correlated with all postoperative audiometric parameters and the Operation Benefit Profile.
   Conclusion: Uncomplicated stapes surgery itself is the only predictor of improvement in listening capabilities and patient satisfaction 6 months after stapes surgery in otosclerosis.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to translate the Chronic Otitis Media Benefit Inventory (COMBI) into Turkish and evaluate the questionnaire's reliability in assessing benefit outcomes in patients after ear surgery.
   Methods: A total of 30 patients with chronic otitis media who underwent ear surgery were asked to fill out the translated Turkish version of the COMBI questionnaire six months after their surgery twice, 10 days apart. The patients were divided into two groups in two different ways based on surgical and audiological outcomes. These were surgical success (SS), surgical failure (SF), audiological success (AS), audiological failure (AF) groups. Student's -t test was performed to show the differences in the COMBI scores of the groups. Cronbach's alpha value was calculated to test internal consistency, Pearson's correlation coefficient was measured to demonstrate test-retest reliability and factor analysis was run.
   Results: The average score of the SS group was 51.08 and significantly higher than the score of the SF group (42.40) (p=0.012). There was, however, no statistically significant difference between the average scores of the AS and the AF groups (p=0.330). A Cronbach's alpha value of 0.862 was found. Pearson's r value was calculated 0.810. Factor analysis showed that a three-factor solution explained the 70.2% of the variance.
   Conclusion: The Turkish version of the COMBI is a valid test with high test-retest reliability. It should be used with objective assessment tools for better understanding how patients benefit from the surgery.

AB  - ObjectiveTo evaluate the difference in overall, hospital, and out-of-hospital cost difference of day-case stapes surgery, compared with inpatient stapes surgery, while maintaining equal hearing outcomes and quality of life (QoL).Study designA single-center, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial in a tertiary referral center.MethodsA total of 112 adult patients planned for primary or revision stapes surgery for clinically suspected otosclerosis were randomly assigned to either the day-case or inpatient treatment group. An evaluation was performed of the difference in total health care-related costs (hospital and out-of-hospital costs) from a hospital and patient perspective over the course of 1 year. Audiometric measurements included pure-tone audiometric measurements and speech audiometry measured at 2 months and 1 year postoperatively. QoL was assessed at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively, using the EQ-5D and HUI3 questionnaires.ResultsA total of 109 cases (100 patients) were analyzed due to three dropouts. The total health care-related costs were <euro>16,586 in the inpatient group (n = 54) and <euro>16,904 in the day-case group (n = 55). The mean postoperative hospital stay was 0.9 days (mean costs of <euro>854) in the inpatient group and 0.5 days (mean costs of <euro>561) in the day-case group (both mean differences statistically significant), with a crossover rate from day-case to the inpatient group of 36% (n = 20) and a crossover rate from inpatient to the day-case group of 11% (n = 6). There were no differences in postoperative complications and objective hearing outcomes. Besides an increased number (0.2) of postoperative telephone consultations in the day-case group, there were no statistically significant differences in postoperative hospital and out-of-hospital costs or visits. The QoL showed no statistically significant differences.ConclusionA day-case approach in primary or revision stapes surgery does not result in a statistically significant reduction of health care-related hospital and out-of-hospital costs compared with an inpatient approach. It also does not affect the surgical outcome (objective audiometric measurements and complication rate), QoL, and postoperative course (number of postoperative hospital and out-of-hospital visits).Level of evidence: 1.ConclusionA day-case approach in primary or revision stapes surgery does not result in a statistically significant reduction of health care-related hospital and out-of-hospital costs compared with an inpatient approach.

AB  - Objective: Otologic trauma was the most common physical injury sustained after the April 15, 2013, Boston Marathon bombings. The goal of this study is to describe the resultant otologic morbidity and to report on early outcomes.
   Study Design: Multi-institutional prospective cohort study.
   Methods: Children and adults seen for otologic complaints related to the Boston Marathon bombings comprised the study population. Participants completed symptom assessments, quality-of-life questionnaires, and audiograms at initial and 6-month visits. Otologic evaluation and treatment, including tympanoplasty results, were reviewed.
   Results: More than 100 patients from eight medical campuses have been evaluated for blast-related otologic injuries; 94 have enrolled. Only 7% had any otologic symptoms before the blasts. Ninety percent of hospitalized patients sustained tympanic membrane perforation. Proximity to blast (RR = 2.7, p < 0.01) and significant nonotologic injury (RR = 2.7, p < 0.01) were positive predictors of perforation. Spontaneous healing occurred in 38% of patients, and tympanoplasty success was 86%. After oral steroid therapy in eight patients, improvement in hearing at 2 and 4 kHz was seen, although changes did not reach statistical significance. Hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty hearing in noise remain persistent and, in some cases, progressive complaints for patients. Otologic-specific quality of life was impaired in this population.
   Conclusion: Blast-related otologic injuries constitute a major source of ongoingmorbidity after the BostonMarathon bombings. Continued follow-up and care of this patient population are warranted.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of stapes surgery in patients presenting with a preoperative mixed hearing loss (bone conduction thresholds >= 40 dB; 40 < air conduction thresholds (AC) < 85 dB). Patients and Methods: A total of 30 patients (32 ears) with mixed hearing loss who underwent primary stapedotomy were evaluated. Audiometric parameters were assessed before and after surgery. Contralateral thresholds were also reported. The need for a hearing aid (HA) after surgery and its impact on quality of life were also measured. Results: AC and word recognition at 40, 55 and 70 dB were significantly improved after stapes surgery. Only 16.6% of the patients needed an HA after surgery and reported being satisfied with the aid. Conclusion: Stapes surgery improved auditory function in patients with mixed hearing loss, allowing most patients to delay the need for an HA without worsening their quality of life. (C) 2018 S.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate postoperative hearing outcomes after lateral temporal bone resection (LTBR) with reconstruction of the external auditory canal (EAC) and conductive function for early-stage EAC carcinoma. Methods: We retrospectively examined patients diagnosed with early-stage EAC carcinoma treated with surgery alone between January 2006 and December 2012. Patients who had postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were excluded. Patients receiving LTBR in combination with tympanoplasty were divided into two groups based on the reconstruction of the EAC with and without (w/o) split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs). Audiological data included the preoperative hearing thresholds and the most recent postoperative hearing thresholds obtained at least 12 months after surgery. The hearing outcome was evaluated based on puretone audiograms using the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery for the evaluation of the results of treatment of conductive hearing loss. The postoperative quality of life (QOL) for patients was evaluated using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Results: All patients (n = 15) achieved disease-free survival without significant morbidity or mortality. When we compared the mean air-bone gaps after surgery, those in the STSG group (n = 8) were found to be significantly lower than those in the w/o STSG group (n = 7; p < 0.001). The success rate for postoperative hearing was 75.0% in the STSG group, which was significantly higher than that in the w/o STSG group (p = 0.014). All patients in the w/o STSG group showed stenosis and closure of the EAC at fewer than 10 months after surgery. In contrast, all patients in the STSG group showed preserved conformation of the new EAC for more than 12 months after surgery. When we compared the mean GBI score between the two groups of patients, the overall and general health scores in the STSG group were found to be significantly higher than those in the w/o STSG group (p = 0.021, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Reconstruction of the EAC using a rolled-up STSG technique in combination with tympanoplasty after LTBR is useful for hearing preservation and the observation of locoregional lesions after surgery, resulting in improved QOL for patients.

AB  - To compare the safety and efficacy of the transobturator tape (Monarc (R)) with the retropubic tape (tension-free vaginal tape, TVT (R)) for the treatment of urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) a prospective, single-blinded, multi-centre randomised clinical controlled trial was undertaken in four urogynaecology units in Australia. One hundred and eighty-seven women with USI were randomly allocated to undergo surgery with either the Monarc sling (n=80) or TVT (n=107). Outcome measures were intra-operative complications (especially bladder injury), as well as peri-operative complications, symptomatology, quality of life and urodynamic outcomes. At 3 months, data were available on 140 women, 82 (59%) TVT and 58 (42%) Monarc. The TVT group was significantly more likely to be complicated by bladder injury (7 TVT, 0 Monarc, p<0.05). Blood loss and operative time were significantly less in the Monarc group, which was 49 mls (31) vs that of the TVT group, which was 64 mls (41) p<0.05; 18.5 min (6.5) TVT vs 14.6 min (6) Monarc (p<0.001). The subjective and objective stress incontinence cure rates were 86.6% (71) vs 72.4% (42) p=0.77 and 79.3 vs 84.5%, p=0.51 for the TVT and Monarc groups, respectively. Both groups reported similar improvement in incontinence impact and satisfaction with their operation, although return to activity was significantly quicker with the transobturator route (p=0.029). The transobturator tape appears to be as effective as the retro-pubic tape in the short term, with a reduction in the risk of intra-operative bladder injury, shorter operating time, decreased blood loss, and quicker return to usual activities.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The study aims to investigate the effect of stapedotomy on audiology measurements and the disease-specific health-related quality of life for patients with otosclerosis using the Danish Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25 as a quality of life measuring tool.
   METHODS: In this study, 50 patients who had undergone stapedotomy at our department between September 2017 and December 2020 were included. Data collection was performed by audiometric testing (pure tone and speech audiometry) in the pre- and postoperative settings. Health-related quality of life was assessed pre- and postoperatively in 30 patients using the validated Danish Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25.
   RESULTS: The mean improvement in air conduction thresholds was 27.7 dB and the mean improvement in air-bone gap was 21.8 dB. Healthrelated quality of life improved significantly after stapes surgery in all subscores of the Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25 (hearing, mental condition, social restriction, and general), except for "tinnitus." The improvement in the audiometric data correlated significantly with the improvement in "total score" and "hearing function" but not with "tinnitus," "social restrictions," and "mental condition."
   CONCLUSION: Stapedotomy leads to significant improvement in hearing and health-related quality of life. The Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25 can be used as a valuable supplement to the hearing test by assessing health-related quality of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy of stapedoplasty in patients aged 60 and older, based on audiometric data and a questionnaire about quality of life.
   DESIGN: A retrospective (1994-2000) study.
   SETTING: People living in southern and central Italy.
   PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-three patients: 32 consecutive patients aged 60 and older (group 1) and 31 consecutive patients younger than 60 (group 2).
   MEASUREMENTS: In each patient, we evaluated the pre- and postoperative auditory thresholds. Each patient answered a questionnaire about postoperative quality of life.
   RESULTS: When comparing the pre- and postoperative air conduction thresholds and air-bone gap in the patients aged 60 and older, a statistically significant (P < .001) improvement at each frequency was observed. When elaborating the answers to the questionnaire about postoperative quality of life, we noticed that the older patients experienced a greater improvement.
   CONCLUSION: The results show that stapedoplasty offers greater improvement in quality of life for selected adults aged 60 and older than for younger adults. The operation also appears to be as safe for adults aged 60 and older as for younger adults. Stapedoplasty provides subjects with satisfactory social hearing level (hearing capacity sufficient for normal social relations) and slows the progression of otosclerosis. Providing older patients with good auditory functionality improves their state of health, quality of life, and cognitive processes.

AB  - Objective: To assess hyperacusis after stapedotomy and its possible influencing factors.
   Study design: Prospective, interventional, and longitudinal study.
   Setting: A tertiary referral center.
   Patients: Fifty consecutive patients (35 females, mean age = 46.8 years).
   Intervention: All patients underwent stapedotomy. The validated Portuguese version of the "Hyperacusis Questionnaire" (HQ) was administered before and two weeks and one month after surgery.
   Results: No hyperacusis was reported by any patient before surgery. At two weeks after surgery, all patients experienced hyperacusis, with a mean HQ at 16.88 +/- 6.54 (range 4-25). One month after surgery, hyperacusis had already resolved in most patients. Gender, preoperative presentation or surgeon had no influence on HQ scores (p > 0.05). Patients with previous contralateral stapedotomy showed lower HQ scores (p = 0.001). Audiological parameters improvement measured at one month after surgery (PTA, SRT and contralateral SRT) were associated with HQ higher scores.
   Conclusion: This study confirms that hyperacusis is a common complaint after stapedotomy that usually resolves in one month after surgery. The HQ highest scores were registered among patients with the highest audiological gain after surgery. This suggests that hyperacusis may be a positive prognostic factor for audiological success after stapedotomy. (c) 2020 PLA General Hospital Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

AB  - Purpose of Review To summarize and critically review recent literature on the relative cost-effectiveness of hearing augmentation versus stapes surgery for the treatment of otosclerosis. Recent Findings Otosclerosis leads to reduced patient quality of life, which can be ameliorated by either stapes surgery, or hearing aid usage. The success of stapes surgery is high, and the risks of serious postoperative complications are low. Hearing aids don't have the complications of surgery but are associated with long-term costs. Cost-effectiveness models have shown that stapes surgery is a cost-effective method for treating otosclerosis. Both stapes surgery and hearing aids can improve patient-reported quality of life in otosclerosis. Stapes surgery has larger upfront costs and surgical risks, but hearing aids are associated with longer lifetime costs. Stapes surgery is cost-effective for the treatment of otosclerosis.

AB  - Objective: To review the published literature related to the different obliteration and reconstruction techniques in the management of the canal wall down mastoidectomy.
   Methods: A PubMed (Medline) and LILACS databases as well as crossed references search was performed with the following Mesh terms: "cholesteatoma", "cholesteatoma-middle ear", "otitis media", "otitis media, suppurative", "mastoiditis", "mastoidectomy", "canal wall down mastoidectomy", "radical mastoidectomy", "mastoid obliteration" and crossed references. Inclusion criteria were adult patients subject to mastoid cavity obliteration and posterior canal wall reconstruction. The technique and materials used, anatomic and functional results, complications, recurrence rates, and changes in quality of life, were analyzed. A total of 94 articles were screened, 38 were included for full-text detailed review.
   Results: Twenty-one articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Techniques and materials used for canal wall reconstruction, tympanoplasty, and ossiculoplasty were varied and included autologous, biosynthetic, or both. Auditory results were reported in 16 studies and were inconsistent. Three studies reported improvement in the quality of life using the GBI scale. Follow-up time ranged from 1 to 83 months. Eleven articles used imaging studies to evaluate postoperative disease recurrence. The highest recurrence rate reported for cholesteatoma after obliteration was 19%. The most frequently reported complications were retraction pockets and transient otorrhea.
   Conclusion: Plenty of techniques combining grafts and other materials have been used to overcome mastoidectomy cavity problems. So far, it is still not possible to standardize an ideal procedure. The available level of evidence for this topic is low and limited. (C) 2021 PLA General Hospital Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

AB  - Objectives: Quality-of-life issues related to chronic otitis media (COM) include physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, hearing loss, speech symptoms, social symptoms, and parents' emotional symptoms. In this study we evaluated the effects of tympanoplasty on the quality of life of pediatric patients.
   Methods: In a questionnaire-based outcome study, we reviewed 56 of 78 pediatric patients with COM who were treated with type I tympanoplasty at our institution between December 2008 and February 2010. All patients were asked to fill out the COM-5 questionnaire with their parents, before operation and 6 months after operation. Preoperative and postoperative total ear scores, preoperative and postoperative ear scores with an intact tympanic membrane, preoperative and postoperative ear scores with a perforated tympanic membrane, and preoperative and postoperative audiological results were assessed.
   Results: After type I tympanoplasty, 45 patients (80.3%) had successful closure of the tympanic membrane, but 11 patients (19.7%) had unsuccessful closure of the tympanic membrane. There was a significant decrease in physical suffering, hearing loss, emotional distress, activity limitations, and caregiver's concerns scores in patients with intact tympanic membranes after operation (p<0.01).
   Conclusions: Children with COM had a significant increase in their quality of life after successful tympanoplasty. Our results also suggested that tympanoplasty was successful in pediatric patients with COM.

AB  - The current study fabricated magnetic functional reduced graphene oxide (MFRGO) by relying on FeCl4- magnetic anion confined to cationic 1-methyl imidazolium. Furthermore, for improving the electrochemical performance of conductive polymer, hybrid poly ortho aminophenol (POAP)/ MFRGO films have then been fabricated by PORP electropolymerization in the presence of MFRGO nanorods as active electrodes for electrochemical supercapacitors. Surface and electrochemical analyses have been used for characterization of MFRGO and POAP/ MFRGO composite films. Different electrochemical methods including galvanostatic charge discharge experiments, cyclic voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy have been applied to study the system performance. Prepared composite film exhibited a significantly high specific capacity, high rate capability and excellent cycling stability (capacitance retention of similar to 91% even after 1000 cycles). These results suggest that electrosynthesized composite films are a promising electrode material for energy storage applications in high-performance pseudocapacitors.

AB  - Background: Otosclerosis is characterized by bony deposits in the otic capsule, resulting in stapes fixation and progressive hearing loss. It can be treated effectively by surgically removing (part of) the stapes and replacing it with a prosthesis. Increasingly, stapes surgery is performed as a day-case procedure. The major drive towards day-case surgery has been out of economic considerations. However, it is also increasingly an explicit patient request and leads to shorter waiting times for surgery, a reduced risk of infection and most likely positively influences the patient's quality of life as a result of rapid discharge and rehabilitation. Even though stapes surgery seems well suited to a day-case approach, given the low complication rates and early recovery, evidence is scarce and of low quality.
   Methods and design: A single-center unblinded randomized controlled trial was designed to (primarily) investigate the effect of hearing outcomes of day-case stapes surgery compared to inpatient stapes surgery and (secondarily) investigate the effect of both methods on quality of life, tinnitus, vertigo and cost-effectiveness. One hundred and twelve adult otosclerosis patients who are eligible for stapes surgery will be randomly assigned to either the day-case or inpatient treatment group. The primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed using pure-tone audiometry (at approximately 2 months and 1 year follow-up), questionnaires (at 3 months and 1 year follow-up) and costs diaries (weekly the first month after which once a month until 1 year follow-up).
   Discussion/conclusion: This trial allows for a comparison between day-case and inpatient stapes surgery to investigate the hypothesis that day-case stapes surgery is associated with a higher quality of life and higher cost-effectiveness, while maintaining equal hearing results, compared to inpatient stapes surgery.

AB  - Conclusions. The patients recovered from the surgery as after unilateral surgery. The success rate for hearing improvement was good both subjectively and objectively, and this was also displayed in the quality of life. According to our study, simultaneous bilateral stapes surgery can be performed safely in selected patients with bilateral conductive hearing loss. Objectives. Otosclerosis is bilateral in the majority of patients. In this study we evaluated the outcome of simultaneous bilateral stapes surgery. Subjects and methods. Eighteen patients suffering from bilateral otosclerosis or osteogenesis imperfecta were prospectively included. After operation, hearing and vestibular function were followed by audiometry and visual feedback posturography (VFP). Patients estimated their hearing gain, the intensity of vestibular symptoms and quality of life score with a questionnaire during the follow-up period of 1 year. Results. The mean improvement in pure-tone average (PTA) air conduction (PTA-AC) was 18 dB (range 1-41 dB). The mean air-bone gap (AB-GAP) diminished from 22 dB (range 10-41 dB) to 7 dB on both sides (range 0-18 dB). The mean preoperative score of 2.3 for hearing improved significantly to 4.1 (p < 0.001). Vestibular symptoms were mild and temporary. The VFP was not permanently impaired in any of the patients. The quality of life score improved significantly from 3.4 to 1.3 postoperatively (p < 0.001).

AB  - Although chronic otitis media is a major cause of conductive and mixed hearing loss, auditory rehabilitation is currently not optimal for this patient group. Planning for hearing rehabilitation must accompany strategies for infection control when surgically managing patients with chronic otitis media. Several barriers prevent adequate hearing restoration in such a heterogeneous patient population. A lack of standardized reporting of surgical interventions, hearing, and quality of life outcomes impedes meta-analyses of existing data and the generation of high-quality evidence, including cost-effectiveness data, through prospective studies. This, in turn, prevents the ability of clinicians to stratify patients based on prognostic indicators, which could guide the decision-making pathway. Strategies to improve reporting standards and methods have the potential to classify patients with chronic otitis media preoperatively, which could guide decision-making for hearing restoration with ossiculoplasty versus prosthetic hearing devices. Appropriately selected clinical guidelines would not only foster directed research but could enhance patient-centered and evidence-based decision-making regarding hearing rehabilitation in the surgical planning process.

AB  - Hoverflies are a conspicuous and popular family within the Diptera. The larvae as well as the adults are able to colonize a wide range of habitats, and many species play important roles as pollinators, in pest management and nowadays in applied nature conservation issues. Despite of this, the state of knowledge on the hoverflies of Austria is deficient: Available literature is outdated in systematics and the species inventory is obviously incomplete. These facts led us to study the Austrian hoverfly fauna in more detail. Syrphidae records from an extensive literature search, additional unpublished data from museum collections and data from own fieldwork were compiled to build a comprehensive checklist of Austrian hoverflies. The species distributions are given by federal state in order to retain a precise overview of this Diptera group. The framework of this research is based on 20520 records and in total, 271957 individuals. The checklist includes 430 confirmed species. An additional 25 hoverfly species are discussed but not included in the list. These are species for which it is unclear if the locality lies within the present borders of Austria, or whose voucher specimens were not available for re-examination. In total 17 hoverfly species are new to Austria: Anasimyia contracta Claussen & Torp, 1980; Brachyopa Platycheirus laskai (Nielsen, 1999); Sphegina verecunda Collin, 1937; Temnostoma angustistriatum Krivosheina, 2002 and Temnostoma meridionale Krivosheina & Mamayev, 1962. In addition, 278 first records for several Austrian federal states are published. With 331 species, Styria currently hosts the largest number of documented species per federal state, followed by Lower Austria (307 spp.), Upper Austria (269 spp.), Carinthia (259 spp.), Vorarlberg (234 spp.), Burgenland (201 spp.), North Tyrol (172 spp.), Vienna (169 spp.), Salzburg (155 spp.) and Eastern Tyrol (154 spp.).

AB  - Single-atom catalysts with full utilization of metal centers can bridge the gap between molecular and solid-state catalysis. Metal-nitrogen-carbon materials prepared via pyrolysis are promising single-atom catalysts but often also comprise metallic particles. Here, we pyrolytically synthesize a Co-N-C material only comprising atomically dispersed cobalt ions and identify with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility measurements and density functional theory the structure and electronic state of three porphyrinic moieties, CoN4C12, CoN3C10,(porp) and CoN2C5. The O-2 electro-reduction and operando X-ray absorption response are measured in acidic medium on Co-N-C and compared to those of a Fe-N-C catalyst prepared similarly. We show that cobalt moieties are unmodified from 0.0 to 1.0 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode, while Fe-based moieties experience structural and electronic-state changes. On the basis of density functional theory analysis and established relationships between redox potential and O-2-adsorption strength, we conclude that cobaltbased moieties bind O-2 too weakly for efficient O-2 reduction.

TI  - Protocol for a validation study of the translated stapesplasty outcome test 25 for measurement of disease-specific quality of life in Dutch patients with otosclerosis

AB  - Introduction Otosclerosis is a common cause of acquired conductive hearing loss and can be treated using hearing aids or surgically. Surgical success rates or surgical results are usually reported using pure-tone audiometric thresholds and/or speech discrimination scores. Audiometric results and patient-reported quality of life after stapes surgery do not seem to correlate well. It is therefore our opinion that health-related quality of life measurements should be implemented as an additional outcome measure after stapes surgery. So far, there is a lack of a valid, reliable and clinically feasible measuring tool for determining health-related quality of life in Dutch patients with otosclerosis who undergo stapes surgery.
   Methods and analysis A prospective validation study was designed to translate and validate the disease-specific Stapesplasty Outcome Test 25 (SPOT-25) in a population of Dutch patients with otosclerosis who undergo primary stapes surgery. A total of 125 patients with otosclerosis who will be undergoing primary stapes surgery and 50 healthy controls will be included. The patients with otosclerosis will fulfil several questionnaires preoperatively, 6 to 8 weeks postoperatively and 8 to 10 weeks postoperatively with a 2-week interval between the postoperative administrations. The patients' audiometric results, which are measured routinely before and after undergoing primary stapes surgery, will also be used. The healthy controls will fulfil the translated SPOT-25 once. First, the original SPOT-25 will be translated from German to Dutch in a six-step process. Second, the translated SPOT-25 will be pilot-tested in a subset of patients. Lastly, validity, reliability and responsiveness of the translated SPOT-25 will be analysed.
   Ethics and dissemination The research protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University Medical Center Utrecht (protocol 18-768/C; V.1, November 2018). Initially, we planned to include 50 patients. At a later stage we decided to increase the sample size to 100 patients. We notified the Institutional Review Board of this change to the protocol. The trial results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed medical journals and presented at scientific conferences.

AB  - New sources of resistance to fungal diseases, including FHB (Fusarium head blight), need to be identified. The results of research investigating ancient wheat species with desirable traits appear promising. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of Fusarium culmorum (W. G. Sm.) Sacc., F. graminearum Schwabe, F. poae (Peck) Wollenw, F. avenaceum (Fr.) Sacc. and F. langsethiae Torp & Nirenberg in the grain and glumes of diploid Triticum monococcum ssp. monococcum, tetraploid T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum, T. turgidum ssp. polonicum and T. turgidum ssp. durum, and hexaploid T. aestivum ssp. spelta and T. aestivum ssp. aestivum grown in north-eastern and south-eastern Poland and to analyze the trichothecene genotypes of the isolated strains. The results of this study also point to shifts in the genotype of Polish F. culmorum and F. graminearum populations from 3-ADON to NIV and 15-ADON to 3-ADON genotypes, respectively. Our findings indicate that selected einkorn lines could potentially be used as sources of genetic material for breeding new varieties resistant to FHB. The fungal genotypes should be closely screened in Poland and the neighboring countries to assess the effects of potential genotypes profile change on fungal virulence, toxin loading and host specificity.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of stapes surgery after 20 years of follow-up and to compare the results between large fenestra versus small fenestra stapedotomy.
   Study Design: Retrospective clinical study.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center (university hospital).
   Patients: One hundred forty-two patients with otosclerosis treated by surgery.
   Intervention: Eighty patients had a total stapedectomy with House-wire prosthesis and 62 patients a stapedotomy with Teflon-piston prosthesis.
   Main Outcome Measures: Preoperative, postoperative, and long-term hearing thresholds were compared. Patients filled in a questionnaire about the impact of surgery on the quality of life and postoperative symptoms.
   Results: The long-term pure tone average improvement did not differ significantly between the techniques compared with the preoperative values. The air-bone gap tended to enlarge as a function of time. The change in the pure tone average was 0.9 dB per year for both techniques. In the questionnaire, some patients reported vertigo, tinnitus, loud noise intolerance, and taste disturbances. Loud noise intolerance seemed to persist in the long term. Surgery had no effect on preoperative tinnitus.
   Conclusions: There were no statistically significant differences between the techniques regarding hearing results. Over the long term, both techniques are safe and effective in restoring hearing and improving quality of life.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis Assumed advantages of a minimally invasive endoscopic transmeatal approach in ear surgery are less postoperative pain, faster healing, and preservation of functional anatomy. We evaluated pain after ear surgery and compared endoscopic transmeatal, microscopic endaural, and retroauricular approaches. Study Design Prospective cohort study. Methods A prospective evaluation of pain during 3 weeks after ear surgery was performed. Three groups were defined: endoscopic transmeatal, microscopic endaural, and retroauricular. Data from 20 fully completed questionnaires (Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form) per group were analyzed with Bayesian and frequentist statistics. Results For all approaches, low pain scores were found, not exceeding 4 on a scale of 0 to 10. Analysis of the worst, least, and average pain scores documented per 24 hours showed no statistically significant difference nor equality between groups. With Bayesian statistics, a Bayes factor of 1.07, 0.25, and 0.51 was found, respectively. With frequentist statistics apvalue of .092, .783, and 0.291 was found, respectively. Small, but statistically significant, differences were found for sleep, natural sleeping position, normal work, and pain medication taken. The location of pain correlates with the incision site. Conclusions The results of this study show that the surgical approach has no clinically relevant influence on postoperative pain after ear surgery. The statistically significant differences on natural sleeping position, sleep, normal work, and amount of pain medication taken are small and should be interpreted with caution. Therefore, these should not be decisive factors in the choice of surgical approach in ear surgery. Level of Evidence 3Laryngoscope, 2020

AB  - Background: Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) is increasingly used in otology, with a growing body of evidence to support its efficacy and safety. The purpose of this survey is to understand the prevalence of EES usage in Australia, attitudes towards EES, and barriers preventing its adoption amongst Australian otolaryngologists.Methods: Members of the Australian Society of Otolaryngology - Head & Neck Surgery (ASOHNS) were contacted to complete a survey on EES. The content of the questionnaire focused on indications for usage, case volumes, attitudes, perceptions, and barriers of EES uptake. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the responses.Results: Sixty-five responses were received (representing 14.4% of ASOHNS members). Twenty-eight (43%) respondents reported performing EES in their practice (EES surgeon), whereas 37 (56.9%) do not perform endoscopic dissection intraoperatively (non-EES surgeon). Of the 28 EES surgeons, only 5 (17.8%) have performed over 50 EES cases. Most common indications for EES were tympanoplasty, cholesteatoma, and ossiculoplasty. Of the 37 non-EES surgeons, 17 (45.9%) use the endoscope intraoperatively to inspect without dissection. The mean duration in practice between EES and non-EES surgeons was 13.0 vs. 21.4 years (P<0.01). Twenty-two (78.6%) in the EES group have attended an EES workshop, compared to 9 (24.3%) in the non-EES group. Both groups felt positively that EES would be relevant in the future of otology (EES group: 4.8, non-EES group 4.0, on a 5-point Likert scale).Conclusions: Although the study response rate was limited, preliminary attitudes towards the adoption and use of EES are positive. Further efforts, including research and workshop development, could help improve penetrance of EES in Australia.

AB  - Harnessing renewable solar energy to valorize CO2 has emerged as a promising and enduring solution to address energy and environmental challenges. However, achieving high efficiency and selectivity in the photocatalytic reduction of CO2, without relying on metals, photosensitizers, or sacrificial agents, remains a formidable hurdle. In the continuing pursuit of sustainable synthesis, in this study, we present the development of a novel metal-free photocatalyst, composed of porphyrin and a triazine-based porous organic polymeric network (TPT-porp) for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 coupled with oxidative benzylamine homocoupling under natural sunlight for the first time. Astonishingly, we achieved an exceptional CO production rate, reaching 1786 mu mol g(-1) h(-1), with an outstanding selectivity of >90% and selective oxidation of benzylamine, yielding N-benzylbenzaldimine with a conversion of 65% and selectivity exceeding 98% in 6 h of irradiation under natural sunlight. A remarkably high AQY of 9.34% (at lambda = 430 nm) and solar-to-fuel conversion of 0.24% was attained for CO production. A series of controlled experiments, EPR studies, (CO2)-C-13 labelling experiments, and DFT studies were employed to unravel the underlying mechanism of this dual photoredox process. In summary, our pioneering study opens up unprecedented avenues for the investigation of metal-free photocatalysts capable for dual photoredox processes, and these findings offer tremendous potential for advancing the field of sustainable photocatalysis.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) significantly impacts auditory functions and overall quality of life. Although tympanoplasty is recognized for its auditory benefits, its broader psychological impacts in CSOM patients remain underexplored. Method: In this sequential explanatory mixed-methods study, 100 adult CSOM patients undergoing tympanoplasty were evaluated from January 2022 to December 2023. The study integrated quantitative assessments (Pure-Tone Audiometry, Speech Audiometry, COMOT-15, HADS) and qualitative data from semi-structured interviews. Results: Post-tympanoplasty, patients exhibited a notable improvement in auditory functions, with an average decrease in Pure-Tone Audiometry (PTA) thresholds by 30 dB and a 28% increase in speech recognition scores. Psychological assessments reflected a significant enhancement in quality of life, with an average decrease of 25 points in COMOT-15 scores, and reductions in HADS anxiety and depression scores by an average of 7 and 6 points, respectively. Qualitative interviews reinforced these results, emphasizing improved social interactions and emotional well-being. A strong correlation was observed between the auditory and psychological improvements. Conclusion: The study demonstrates that tympanoplasty in CSOM patients leads to significant auditory and psychological improvements, highlighting the necessity of a comprehensive treatment approach. This underscores the importance of considering both physical and mental health in CSOM management.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Cholesteatoma is a sac in the middle ear cleft lined by stratified squamous epithelium and containing keratin debris. It is capable of soft tissue and bone destruction, thus leading to several, even life-threatening, complications. Surgical therapy is the mainstay of management.
   Aims and Objectives-To study the distribution of cholesteatoma in different age groups & various socioeconomic classes, its various modes of presentation, complications, different modes of management and postoperative outcome.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   The study has been carried out on 80 patients in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, MKCG Medical College & Hospital, Berhampur, Odisha, from October 2011 to September 2013. Thorough history of all the patients was taken and complete ear, nose and throat examination was done. Hearing was assessed by pure tone audiometry. HRCT scan of bilateral temporal bones was done in patients with complications. All the patients underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy along with postoperative follow-up.
   Setting and Design-Prospective study conducted at a tertiary referral institution.
   RESULTS
   Cholesteatoma was most common in the second decade of life, mostly in low socioeconomic class. The common mode of presentation was fowl smelling ear discharge followed by conductive hearing loss. 30 cases presented with complications-21 cases of mastoid abscess, 3 cases of meningitis, 1 case each of facial nerve paralysis, Luc's abscess, zygomatic abscess, jugular vein thrombosis, petrositis and temporal lobe abscess. All cases were treated with Canal wall down mastoidectomy, with tympanoplasty done in 11 cases. Postoperative complications like discharging cavity was present in 18 cases. Hearing improvement was more than 10 dB in 70% cases.
   CONCLUSION
   Cholesteatoma is an aggressive disease. Improving socioeconomic condition and increasing awareness about the disease will prevent the progression of the disease & its complications can be reduced. Thus, basic knowledge about the disease among the medical practitioners promotes timely diagnosis and prompt referral, so that appropriate surgical intervention would reduce mortality and morbidity due to cholesteatoma.

AB  - Periodontal disease is a multifactorial, bacterially induced inflammatory condition characterized by the progressive destruction of periodontal tissues. The successful nonsurgical treatment of periodontitis requires multifunctional technologies offering antibacterial therapies and promotion of bone regeneration simultaneously. For the first time, in this study, an injectable piezoelectric hydrogel (PiezoGEL) was developed after combining gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) with biocompatible piezoelectric fillers of barium titanate (BTO) that produce electrical charges when stimulated by biomechanical vibrations (e.g., mastication, movements). We harnessed the benefits of hydrogels (injectable, light curable, conforms to pocket spaces, biocompatible) with the bioactive effects of piezoelectric charges. A thorough biomaterial characterization confirmed piezoelectric fillers' successful integration with the hydrogel, photopolymerizability, injectability for clinical use, and electrical charge generation to enable bioactive effects (antibacterial and bone tissue regeneration). PiezoGEL showed significant reductions in pathogenic biofilm biomass (similar to 41%), metabolic activity (similar to 75%), and the number of viable cells (similar to 2-3 log) compared to hydrogels without BTO fillers in vitro. Molecular analysis related the antibacterial effects to be associated with reduced cell adhesion (downregulation of porP and fimA) and increased oxidative stress (upregulation of oxyR) genes. Moreover, PiezoGEL significantly enhanced bone marrow stem cell (BMSC) viability and osteogenic differentiation by upregulating RUNX2, COL1A1, and ALP. In vivo, PiezoGEL effectively reduced periodontal inflammation and increased bone tissue regeneration compared to control groups in a mice model. Findings from this study suggest PiezoGEL to be a promising and novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of periodontal disease nonsurgically.

AB  - Objective.-To examine the relationship between doctor-parent communication patterns and parents' perceptions that they were listened to by the doctor.
   Design.-Cross-sectional, clinic-based survey. Before the visit, parents were asked about the strength of their desires/preferences for being listened to; after the visit, they were asked if their desires were fulfilled and to rate their satisfaction with care. Encounters were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded for parent requests for information and action and physician responses to those requests. Coding was performed using an adapted version of the Taxonomy of Requests by Patients (TORP). Physician responses to parental requests for information were coded as brief. moderate, or prolonged fulfillment or as partially fulfilled, ignored, or denied.
   Setting.-Two private pediatric practices, I community based and I university based.
   Participants.-Ten of 13 eligible physicians (participation rate. 77%) and 306 of 356 eligible parents (participation rate, 86%) who sought care for their children's respiratory illnesses. Parents were invited to participate if they spoke and read English and if their child was 2-10 years old. had a chief complaint of cold symptoms. and was seeing one of the participating physicians. Complete data were obtained for 287 doctor-parent encounters (94%).
   Results.-Before the visit. 74% of parents reported that they considered it necessary for the physician to listen to their ideas about their child's illness. Among these parents. 62% (n = 130) reported after the visit that the physician had listened to their ideas. As the proportion of moderate-length responses to parent requests for information increased, parents were significantly more likely to report being listened to (P < .05). Multivariate results indicated a 59% probability of parents reporting that they were listened to when given moderate-length responses, 45% when given brief responses, 39% when given prolonged responses, and 12% when requests for information were only partially fulfilled., ignored, or denied. The length of response to parent requests for information was not related to overall parent satisfaction.
   Conclusions.-Parents who received moderate-length answers to their questions were most likely to report that they were listened to. Although it is assumed that lengthier, in-depth explanations result in higher satisfaction, this study suggests that more doctor talk does not necessarily constitute better communication.

AB  - Cytophaga hutchinsonii glides rapidly over surfaces and employs a novel collection of cell-associated proteins to digest crystalline cellulose. HimarEm1 transposon mutagenesis was used to isolate a mutant with an insertion in CHU_0170 (sprP) that was partially deficient in gliding motility and was unable to digest filter paper cellulose. SprP is similar in sequence to the Porphyromonas gingivalis type IX secretion system (T9SS) protein PorP that is involved in the secretion of gingipain protease virulence factors and to the Flavobacterium johnsoniae T9SS protein SprF that is needed to deliver components of the gliding motility machinery to the cell surface. We developed an efficient method to construct targeted nonpolar mutations in C. hutchinsonii and deleted sprP. The deletion mutant was defective in gliding and failed to digest cellulose, and complementation with sprP on a plasmid restored both abilities. Sequence analysis predicted that CHU_3105 is secreted by the T9SS, and deletion of sprP resulted in decreased levels of extracellular CHU_3105. The results suggest that SprP may function in protein secretion. The T9SS may be required for motility and cellulose utilization because cell surface proteins predicted to be involved in both processes have C-terminal domains that are thought to target them to this secretion system. The efficient genetic tools now available for C. hutchinsonii should allow a detailed analysis of the cellulolytic, gliding motility, and protein secretion machineries of this common but poorly understood bacterium.

AB  - Chronic otitis media surgery in the only hearing ear. Objectives: The present study aimed to investigate how quality of life was impacted in patients who underwent surgery for chronic otitis media in their only remaining hearing ear (OHE). Such surgical treatment is controversial, and avoided by many surgeons due to the high risk of hearing loss due to surgery. However, if the patient is left untreated, hearing may further deteriorate over time, decreasing the patient's quality of life to an undesirable level.
   Method: We performed a retrospective single-institution study of a prospectively collected database in a tertiary university hospital. Twenty-three patients with OHE who underwent surgical treatment were retrospectively analyzed. The patients' age, sex, treated ear, indications, and preoperative and postoperative hearing levels were recorded. The data were statistically analyzed.
   Results: Of the 23 patients with 01-1E, 15 regularly attended follow-up for at least two years. In all cases, the tympanic membrane perforations were closed and the ear drum became dry. An air-bone gap gain of <= 20 dB was measured in five patients, <= 10 dB in seven, and two patients showed no significant change (4-10 dB). One patient showed minimal hearing deterioration of -2 dB.
   Conclusion: Patients with OHE can be treated surgically to improve hearing levels and quality of life. Modern surgical techniques and instruments - especially in experienced hands - may reduce the possible surgical risks. If hearing deteriorates due to surgery, it may be improved, for example, with cochlear implantation surgery.

AB  - Background: Septoplasty, endoscopic sinus surgery, and tympanoplasty are the most commonly performed elective functional ear-nose-throat surgeries. Aim: This study investigated the relationship between preoperative anxiety, bruxism, and postoperative pain in inpatient groups undergoing three different functional otorhinolaryngologic surgeries. Patients and Methods: This study was conducted in a single center of a tertiary referral hospital. The patients (n = 90) who had undergone septoplasty (group A), endoscopic sinus surgery (group B), and tympanoplasty (group C) were included. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire and the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety Information Scale (APAIS) were administered. To evaluate bruxism, a self-questionnaire was administered, and for the evaluation of pain, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was administered. Results: In group C, preoperative STAI and APAIS and early and late pain values were higher than in the other groups. When patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of bruxism. A significant difference was found between the preoperative STAI and immediate and late VAS values (P < 0.001). A strong correlation was observed between APAIS and early and late VAS values in group C (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Patients who will undergo tympanoplasty should be aware of the preoperative anxiety level and pain follow-up. Bruxism can be considered a vital follow-up parameter that manifests due to high preoperative anxiety. It may also be useful to examine preoperative bruxism and take appropriate measures due to its pain-increasing effect in patients.

AB  - Background: The rise in the use of prescription opioids for postoperative analgesia within surgery has mirrored an increased trend of opioid-related morbidity within Canada and the United States. This study prospectively studied daily pain levels and medication requirements postoperatively in patients undergoing elective Otolaryngology-Head and Neck surgery procedures.
   Methods: Patients were asked to prospectively document their pain level and medication use daily for 7 days postoperatively. A final survey was used to quantify unused medication left at home and clarify each patient's disposal plan. We included patients undergoing elective outpatient or short stay surgeries from three tertiary care centers in Toronto, Ontario from September 2016 to September 2017. Previous opioids users or patients suffering from chronic pain were excluded.
   Results: A final cohort of 56 eligible adult patients were included in the study. The most common procedures were thyroidectomy (n=19), endoscopic sinus surgery (n=10), tympanoplasty/ossiculoplasty (n=7), and cochlear implant (n=5). Most patients received a prescription for acetaminophen/codeine (n=29, 51.8%) or acetaminophen/oxycodone (n=22, 39.3%) and used on average 29% of their initial prescription. Patients most commonly opted to keep their unused narcotics at home (n=23, 41%). A total of 710 tablets of narcotics were overprescribed in our study population, 351 of which were kept in patients' home for future use.
   Conclusion: There is a clear tendency to overestimate postoperative pain resulting in significant overprescription of opioids among Otolaryngologists.

AB  - The Type IX secretion system (T9SS) is a versatile multi-protein complex restricted to bacteria of the Bacteriodetes phylum and responsible for the secretion or cell surface exposition of diverse proteins that participate to Slayer formation, gliding motility or pathogenesis. The T9SS is poorly characterized but a number of proteins involved in the assembly of the secretion apparatus in the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis have been identified based on genome substractive analyses. Among these proteins, PorY, and PorX encode typical two-component system (TCS) sensor and CheY-like response regulator respectively. Although the porX and porY genes do not localize at the same genetic locus, it has been proposed that PorXY form a bona fide TCS. Deletion of porX in P. gingivalis causes a slight decrease of the expression of a number of other T9SS genes, including soy, porT, porP, porK, porL, porM, porN, and porY. Here, we show that PorX and the soluble cytoplasmic domain of PorY interact. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, DNA-protein co-purification and heterologous host expression assays, we demonstrate that PorX does not bind T9SS gene promoters and does not directly regulate expression of the T9SS genes. Finally, we show that PorX interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of PorL, a component of the T9SS membrane core complex and propose that the CheY-like PorX protein might be involved in the dynamics of the T9SS.

AB  - Recent interferences of hemodynamic functions via modified brain neuronal mechanisms have proven to be major causes of dementia and sleeping disorders. In this work, cerebral expression differences of the neuroactive vesicular chromogranin A (CgA) and distinct a GABA(A)R subunits were detected in the facultative hibernating hamster. In particular, damaged neuronal fields of hypotensive torpor (TORP) state were correlated to elevated CgA and GABA(A)R alpha(1), alpha(4) mRNA levels in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), central amygdalar nucleus (CeA) plus solitary tractus nucleus (NTS). Conversely, few neurodegeneration signals of hypertensive arousal (AROU) state, accounted for mostly lower CgA levels in the same areas. This state also provided increased alpha(2)-containing sites in amygdala, hippocampal and NTS neurons together with elevated alpha(4)-containing receptors in the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus (Pe). Interestingly in our hibernating model, CgA appeared to preferentially feature inhibitory neurosignals as indicated by preliminary perfusion of amygdalar sites with its highly specific antihypertensive derived peptide (catestatin) promoting GABA-dependent sIPSCs. Overall, evident neuronal damages plus altered expression capacities of CgA and alpha(1)-, alpha(2)-, alpha(4)-CABAAR5 in CeA, Pe, PVN as well as NTS during both hibernating states corroborate for the first time key molecular switching events guaranteeing useful cardiovascular rescuing abilities of neurodegenerative disorders.

AB  - Objective: In the year 2000, the Otological Society of Japan proposed a new criteria to assess the levek of hearing known as Criteria 2(m. However, these criteria are intended to assess pure tone threshold after tympanoplasty and the results do not necessarily reflect the hearing condition from the patient's perspective. Thus, it is essential to stud), the relationship between the subjective evaluation ot post-operative hearing based oil the patient's own assessment and the objective assessment by audiometry. Methods: The present study is a questionnaire-based survey on the levels of post-operative hearing in 460 patients whose degree of satisfaction with their levels of hearing was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS). The hearing level was assessed based on the Criteria 2000 established by the Otological Society of Japan. Results: The post-operative results indicated a success rate of 78.7%. According to the questionnaire-based survey, 64.4% patients considered their hearing as "improved". The average VAS score was the highest in the "improved" group and gradually decreased when in the "deteriorated" group. The highest success rate was obtained in patients who assessed their hearing as "improved" and the lowest rate was seen in those who assessed their hearing as "deteriorated". On the other hand, the success rate in the three groups. "slightly improved". "unchanged", and "slightly deteriorated", was almost similar and did not relate to the objective audiometry findings. Therefore. except for the "improved" and deteriorated" groups, there is no relation between the subjective self-assessment and the objective post-operative, hearing. Conclusion: A bi-directional approach. one from an audiological (objective) and one front the patient's perspective (subjective). especially using VAS. is quite useful for the post-operative assessment of hearing, (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - In patients with inadequate hearing improvement after tympanoplasty and failure of conventional hearing aid fitting, active hearing implants provide an alternative treatment option. Active middle ear implants function as a vibromechanical bypass of the stiffness and damping effect of a poorly oscillating tympanic membrane and the (reconstructed) ossicular chain. The selection of the hearing system depends on the maximum output levels of the hearing system and the anatomical conditions in mostly multiply operated ears. The development of variable coupling elements for active middle ear implants led to an extension of the indications to include not only purely sensorineural hearing loss but also mixed and conductive hearing loss in patients, as the transducer can now be coupled to the (mobile) stapes or the round window membrane. The article provides an overview of current clinical study results and recommendations on the indications for active hearing implants in patients with chronic otitis media.

AB  - Objective: To survey graduating residents or recent graduates of otolaryngology residency programs to evaluate their Otology/Neurotology (ON) experience in residency and discern if they had received adequate training in time to decide whether to pursue a fellowship in Otology or Neurotology.
   Study Design: Internet-based survey.
   Methods: A survey was distributed to all US otolaryngology residency programs to distribute to 5th year residents and recent graduates in last 4 years. The survey assessed satisfaction in ON experience, presence of ON fellows, adequacy of experience to decide on ON fellowship, postgraduate year (PGY) year at which residents observed, performed, and proficiently performed five procedures (tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy, ossiculoplasty, stapedectomy, and cochlear implant), and plan for performing these surgeries in practice.
   Results: 89/106 (84%) of respondents felt they had adequate training in Otology in time to decide whether or not to pursue a fellowship and were found to observe and perform surgeries significantly earlier in training by PGY including: mastoidectomy (observed PGY 1.9 versus PGY 2.3, performed PGY 2.9 versus PGY 3.5), ossiculoplasty (observed 2.1 versus 3.0, performed 3.6 versus 4.3), stapedectomy (observed 2.3 versus 3.0, performed 3.9 versus 4.5), and cochlear implant (observed 2.1 versus 2.8, performed 3.4 versus 4.1) all p < 0.05. There were 19/106 (17.9%) respondents who came from programs with fellowships and 78.9% thought fellows were beneficial to their ON experience.
   Conclusions: Early exposure to ON surgeries may aid in residents' decision to pursue a fellowship in ON. The presence of fellows appears to facilitate residents' ON experience.

AB  - Objectives: Literature review shows a limited number of studies investigating chronic pain following ear surgeries. The effect of mastoidectomy on chronic postsurgical pain, however, has never been investigated. The present study investigates not only the incidence and severity of chronic pain following ear surgeries with and without mastoidectomy, but also predisposing diseases for pain.
   Patients and Methods: The study was performed in a total of 150 patients who underwent tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy through a retroauricular incision in a single tertiary health care center. During the routine postoperative 3rd-month examination, the patients were questioned for the presence and severity of chronic pain, as well as the diseases that might predispose the pain.
   Results: The difference between the visual analog scale scores of the groups was not statistically significant. Comparison of pain character revealed that neuropathic pain is more prevalent in both the groups. Evaluating the relationship between concomitant diseases and chronic pain, it was observed that migraine, cervical pathology, and acute postsurgical pain were closely associated with chronic pain.
   Conclusion: It was demonstrated that mastoidectomy does not pose an additional risk for chronic postsurgical pain. However, patients with migraine, cervical pathology, and acute postsurgical pain are at risk for chronic postsurgical pain.

   Introduction: Neck pain is a common complaint among fighter pilots. With implementation of the joint helmet mounted cuing system (JHMCS), the strain on the pilot's neck has increased. Methods: We surveyed 58 F-16 pilots from the Royal Danish Air Force by anonymous questionnaires. More than half of these pilots used JHMCS regularly. Results: The response rate Was 100%. Of the pilots, 97% experienced neck pain in flight or shortly after flying, 83% within the last year. Right side neck pain was significantly more frequent than left side, odds ratio 3.25. There was a strong tendency toward predominant right-sided shoulder pain. The pilots reported that combined rotation and extension movements were especially hazardous. Only 1 in 10 pilots moved his head independent of G-load Neck pain influenced operational flying, especially the ability to perform a "check six" movement sufficiently, and affected flying with high G loads as occurs in basic fighter maneuvers and air combat maneuvering. Discussion: To avoid neck problems the majority of pilots aim to avoid certain head movements and to fix their neck before exposing themselves to high +G(z) loads. With the implementation of JHMCS, two conflicting goals are evident and working at cross-purposes. A pilot's head should remain stationary while exposed to high +G(z) loads. However, maximizing the advantages of JHMCS encourages the pilot to move his head sharply while exposed to high +G(z) loads. Training programs, to help the pilots cope with these challenges are warranted.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the subjective evaluation of patients postoperatively about their hearing, otorrhea, and tinnitus by using a questionnaire and to determine factors affecting patient satisfaction following tympanoplasty.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: Patients who underwent tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy due to chronic otitis media were included the study. Patients were called by telephone and invited to a control examination and to answer a questionnaire survey. Patients who came to the control examination were asked about any changes in their hearing and the presence or absence of tinnitus and otorrhea. The overall subjective satisfaction of the surgery was measured by visual analog scale (VAS).
   RESULTS: One hundred forty-seven patients who underwent tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy with a mean age 33.32 +/- 11.27 were included the study. There were statistically significant differences between the patients whose grafts were successfully healed versus those not healed, according to VAS score (p<0.001). VAS score was significantly higher in patients whose tinnitus decreased or disappeared (p=0.001) and in patients whose otorrhea completely disappeared (p=0.008).
   CONCLUSION: Postoperative patient satisfaction must be taken into consideration for the evaluation of the success of tympanoplasty surgery, in addition to objective criteria. Healing of the tympanic membrane, relief of tinnitus, hearing improvement, and relief from otorrhea were highly correlated with patient satisfaction.

AB  - Objectives: We evaluated the relationship between pathological nasal conditions and pathological middle ear conditions on a large-scale epidemiological basis, conducted as a cross-sectional study at the population level using Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) data.
   Study design: A cross-sectional study.
   Methods: In a retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from the KNHANES (2008-2012), which used a stratified, multi-stage, probability-cluster sampling method in a rolling sampling survey of South Korean citizens.
   Results: The prevalences of nasal and middle ear pathologies were evaluated. Chronic postnasal drip, chronic hypertrophic rhinitis, and nasal polyps were correlated with the presence of middle ear pathologies; allergic rhinitis was negatively correlated. The prevalences of chronic otitis media and septal deviation showed no relationship. Only nasal polyps showed a tendency to be associated with cholesteatomatous otitis media in patients with COM.
   Conclusions: Our results indicate the need for a nasal assessment when evaluating COM. Additionally, correction of nasal pathologies may be useful with the surgical treatment of COM to improve patient success rates and satisfaction.

AB  - This case study describes a 72-year-old female with a history of stapedectomy 40 years prior. She presented experiencing vertigo, fogginess, and imbalance for 9 months. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed that the prosthesis was displaced into the vestibule by approximately 2.1 to 2.4 mm. The patient was presented with treatment options, including observation, removal, replacement of the prosthesis, and an oval window patch. The patient opted for observation as the symptoms she was experiencing did not significantly impact her quality of life. Although a stapedectomy may fail for a multitude of reasons, some of the most common causes are prosthesis displacement, especially out of the oval window into the middle ear or away from the incus. Incus necrosis may also play a substantial role in failure.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the audiologic outcomes of the patients who underwent endoscopy on one ear and microscopic tympanoplasty on the other, and to investigate the operative time, graft success, postoperative pain and health status. This prospective randomized controlled study was carried out in Ege University ENT Department between February 2015 and September 2016. The patients who had bilateral chronic otitis media, normal middle ear mucosa and a hearing loss difference of 10 dB or less between the two ears randomly underwent microscopic tympanoplasty in one ear and endoscopic tympanoplasty in the contralateral ear, with 6-month intervals. 13 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 36.17 +/- 3.61 years (range 17-53 years, 7 female, 6 male). The improvement in air-bone gap for groups 1 (endoscopic) and 2 (microscopic) was 9.48 +/- 5.23 and 9.89 +/- 2.79 dB, respectively. The duration of the surgery in group 1 was significantly lower than that in group 2 (p < 0.01). VAS scores were 2.15 +/- 0.37 and 3.76 +/- 1.64 cm for groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.006). The endoscopic approach for type 1 tympanoplasty offers shorter surgery time, better health status and lower postoperative pain than microscopic surgery. In addition, endoscopic surgery offers comparable improvement in air-bone gap and similar graft success. The endoscopic approach has comparable audiological and morphological graft outcomes with the microscopic one. The endoscopic approach yielded better health and pain status for the same patients.
   Level of evidence This is an individual randomized controlled trial. The level of evidence is 1b.

AB  - IntroductionOne-handedness is a challenge in conventional endoscopic ear surgery (EES). We present results on the first-ever application of the passive endoscope holder 'Endofix exo' (Co. AKTORmed GmbH, Neutraubling, Germany) in EES, which enables two-handed surgery. MethodsThis two-sided study compares cut-suture time, operating time, postoperative complications, graft take rates, hearing results and quality of life in patients who underwent first stage tympanoplasty due to tympanic membrane perforation with intact ossicular chain conditions. 25 patients received classic EES (EES-, mean age: 28 +/- 21 years) and 15 received EES with the passive holder (EES+, mean age: 48 +/- 21 years). ResultsMean operating times (EES-: 96 +/- 38 (SD) min; EES+: 107 +/- 33 min), cut-suture times (EES-: 68 +/- 30 min; EES+: 73 +/- 31 min), complications, graft take rates and hearing results (preoperative air bone gap (ABG) (PTA4): 15 dB +/- SD 8 dB (EES-); 16 dB +/- SD 8 dB (EES+); postoperative ABG (PTA4): 11.25dB +/- SD 11.3dB (EES-); 14 dB +/- SD 10 dB (EES+)) did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between the two groups. Postoperative hearing results and quality of life tended to improve in both groups (p > 0.05). DiscussionThe passive endoscope holder has been successfully applied during the course of the study. However, modifications of the endoscope holder and further studies are recommended focusing on positioning of grafts and prostheses to obtain conclusive results regarding the superiority of two-handed EES over one-handed conventional EES.

AB  - Tenacibaculum maritimum, the etiological agent of tenacibaculosis in marine fish, constitutively secretes extracellular products (ECPs) in which protein content has not been yet comprehensively studied. In this work, the prevalence of extracellular proteolytic and lipolytic activities related to virulence was analyzed in 64 T. maritimum strains belonging to the O1-O4 serotypes. The results showed the existence of a great intra-specific heterogeneity in the enzymatic capacity, particularly within serotype O4. Thus, the secretome of a strain belonging to this serotype was characterized by analyzing the protein content of ECPs and the possible production of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Notably, the ECPs of T. maritimum SP9.1 contain a large amount of OMVs that were characterized by electron microscopy and purified. Thus, ECPs were divided into soluble (S-ECPs) and insoluble fractions (OMVs), and their protein content was analyzed by a high-throughput proteomic approach. A total of 641 proteins were identified in ECPs including some virulence-related factors, which were mainly found in one of the fractions, either OMVs or S-ECPs. Outer membrane proteins such as TonB-dependent siderophore transporters and the type IX secretion system (T9SS)-related proteins PorP, PorT, and SprA appeared to be mainly associated with OMVs. By contrast, putative virulence factors such as sialidase SiaA, chondroitinase CslA, sphingomyelinase Sph, ceramidase Cer, and collagenase Col were found only in the S-ECPs. These findings clearly demonstrate that T. maritimum releases, through surface blebbing, OMVs specifically enriched in TonB-dependent transporters and T9SS proteins. Interestingly, in vitro and in vivo assays also showed that OMVs could play a key role in virulence by promoting surface adhesion and biofilm formation and maximizing the cytotoxic effects of the ECPs. The characterization of T. maritimum secretome provides insights into ECP function and can constitute the basis for future studies aimed to elucidate the full role of OMVs in the pathogenesis of fish tenacibaculosis.

AB  - Positive surgical indications for an only hearing ear were evaluated in order to improve patients' quality of life. Fifteen cases of surgery involving an only hearing ear over the past eight years were retrospectively reviewed. Of eight perforated chronic otitis media cases, seven underwent type one tympanoplasty and one underwent simple underlay myringoplasty regardless of otorrhoea at the time of surgery. Of six cholesteatoma cases, two received the canal wall up method and four received the canal wall down method. Ossiculoplasty was carefully performed in six cases. Hearing was improved in seven cases, whereas it remained unchanged in seven cases and deteriorated in one case. Of nine patients, two did not need a hearing aid after surgery. Five patients with severe combined hearing loss (> 90 dB) were able to communicate with a hearing aid, alleviating their anxiety regarding hearing loss. Only hearing ears with chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma can be successfully treated by tympanoplasty with or without ossiculoplasty.

AB  - Newer surgical tools, which have been widely accepted as important adjuncts in otological surgery, include the laser. otoendoscopy and facial nerve monitoring. A confidential postal questionnaire survey was carried out to evaluate the usage of these newer techniques among the Consultant members of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Our study revealed that the usage of otoendoscopy, laser and/or facial nerve monitoring is not as widespread as might be thought among otological surgeons in the United Kingdom.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated functional results after stapedotomy in terms of the influence of preoperative hearing threshold.
   STUDY DESIGN: Case series and chart review.
   SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We classified 141 patients according to preoperative mean air-conduction threshold: 40 to 54 dB, group 1; 55 to 69 dB, group 2; and 70 to 89 dB, group 1 Speech discrimination scores also were noted.
   RESULTS: All groups showed significant improvement. The greatest increase in postoperative speech discrimination score was seen in group 3. Group I improved from moderate hearing loss (mean, 49 dB) to normal (mean, 24 dB); group 2, from moderately severe loss (mean, 61.2 dB) to mild (mean, 28 dB); and group 3. from severe loss (mean, 76.4 dB) to moderate (mean, 41.1 dB).
   CONCLUSION: Success in treating otosclerosis does not depend on extent of preoperative hearing loss. Patients with severe loss improved to moderate, increasing the benefit front use of a hearing aid. The patients attained good auditory function, improving their quality of life.

AB  - Far-advanced otosclerosis (FAO) refers to severe otosclerosis with scarce auditory functions. The identification of the best method to correctly listen to sound and speech has a large impact on patients' quality of life. We retrospectively analyzed the auditory function of 15 patients affected by FAO who were treated with stapedectomy plus hearing aids independent of the severity of their auditory deficit before surgery. The combination of surgery and hearing aids allowed excellent recovery of the perception of pure tone sounds and speech. Four patients, because of poor auditory thresholds, needed a cochlear implant after stapedectomy. Despite being based on a small sample of patients, our results suggest that stapedotomy plus hearing aids could improve the auditory capacities of patients with FAO independent of their auditory thresholds at T0. The careful selection of patients is fundamental to obtain the best outcomes.

AB  - Purpose of Review This review will highlight recent outcome-based evidence guiding decision making for cochlear implantation in advanced otosclerosis, related complications, and technical surgical considerations in otosclerosis and the obstructed cochlea. Recent Findings Cochlear implantation in advanced otosclerosis results in consistent, excellent auditory outcomes with improvement in both objective speech recognition scores and subjective quality of life measures. Facial nerve stimulation may occur at higher rates in otosclerosis cochlear implant recipients. Cochlear implantation in the setting of luminal obstruction in osteosclerotic patients may be managed with altered surgical technique to achieve successful auditory improvements. Pre-operative imaging with high resolution CT or MRI may help anticipate intraoperative challenges and post-operative complications in cochlear implantation. Cochlear implantation is an established, successful treatment for profound hearing loss in advanced otosclerosis. Surgeon knowledge of outcomes, complications, and potential surgical challenges is important to appropriately counsel patients regarding auditory rehabilitation options in advanced otosclerosis.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate that neurotologists enjoy performing stapedectomies. Subjects: A group of survey recipients consisting of 174 neurotologists who perform stapedectomy, a nonoverlapping control group of 145 head/neck oncologists who perform parotidectomy, and a second nonoverlapping control group of 365 pediatric otolaryngologists who perform tonsillectomy. Outcome Measures: Responses to surveys distributed by electronic mail to the 3 nonoverlapping recipient groups during nonoverlapping 4-week periods. Results: During the 4-week survey periods, 84 of 174 neurotologists (48%) responded, while 33 of 145 oncologists (23%) and 87 of 365 pediatric otolaryngologists (24%) responded. Most neurotologists performed stapedectomy (80/84; 95% of survey responders), while 33 of 33 (100% of survey responders) oncologists performed parotidectomy and 87 of 87 (100% of survey responders) pediatric otolaryngologists performed tonsillectomy. Seventy-six of the 80 neurotologists who performed stapedectomies (95%) enjoyed performing it, slightly more than the 30 of the 33 oncologists who performed parotidectomies (91%) and appreciably more than the 67 of 87 pediatric otolaryngologists who performed tonsillectomies (77%). Twenty-three neurotologists (30%) would sacrifice vacation time to perform additional stapedectomies, slightly more than 8 oncologists (27%) for additional parotidectomies and more than the 7 pediatric otolaryngologists (10%) for additional tonsillectomies. Ten (13%) of the neurotologists, 3 (9%) of the oncologists, and 1 (2%) of the pediatric otolaryngologists would sacrifice 5 or more vacation days to perform more of the procedures. Conclusions: Our data suggest that neurotologists enjoy performing stapedectomy.

KW  - Surgery
AB  - Background: The pathogenesis of recurrent cholesteatoma can be roughly divided into residual lesions and re-retraction of the epithelium. To prevent both residual and re-retraction cholesteatoma, we performed canal wall down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration using the bone pate plate for canal wall reconstruction as a fundamental surgical treatment for patients with acquired cholesteatoma. We attempted to achieve the complete extirpation of cholesteatoma in the wide surgical field made by the canal wall down procedure and simultaneously prevent recurrent retraction cholesteatoma and regain the physiologic canal wall, in which patients can have a ``maintenance-free ear.''
   Objective: The surgical method used in the present study was described, and the long-term postoperative results of this method were evaluated.
   Study Design: Retrospective study.
   Patients: Participants were 118 patients with acquired cholesteatoma who underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration and could be followed-up for more than 5 years.
   Main Outcome Measures: Postoperative changes in the reconstructed canal wall, the rate of otorrhea, and exposure of the material were examined using endoscopic images, medical charts, and CT scans.
   Results: A total of 113 ears (95.8 %) achieved the nearly physiologic appearance of the external auditory canal, and these conditions were maintained throughout the follow-up periods. However, recurrent cholesteatoma was not observed during the follow-up periods. Postoperative otorrhea was observed in 2.5% of ears. Exposure of the bone pate was only noted in 1 patient (0.8 %). Postoperative CT scans confirmed that ossification developed in the bone pate used in the reconstructed canal wall and mastoid surface.
   Conclusion: Canal wall down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration using the bone pate plate for canal wall reconstruction prevents both recurrent and residual cholesteatoma and contributes to a good quality of life for the patient.

AB  - Objective Our study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of mastoid obliteration compared to the canal wall up (CWU) technique in cholesteatoma surgery based on the systematic review of the literature and the meta-analysis of the data. Methods The systematic search was performed in four major databases (MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and CENTRAL) on October 14, 2021. Studies comparing the CWU technique and mastoid obliteration were included. The exclusion criteria were less than 12 months follow-up, congenital cholesteatoma, indefinite description of the surgical method, and animal studies. The protocol was registered on Prospero (registration number: CRD42021282485). The risk of bias was evaluated with the ROBINS-I tool. Residual and recurrent disease proportions as primary outcomes, quality of life, ear discharge, infection rates, hearing results, and operation time as secondary outcomes were analyzed. In the quantitative synthesis, the random effect model was used, and heterogeneity was identified. Results A total of 11 articles with 2077 operations' data were found eligible. All the identified studies were retrospective cohorts. The odds of pooled residual and recurrent disease proportion were significantly lower in the obliteration group compared to CWU (OR = 0.45, CI:0.28;0.80, p = 0.014). However, when separated, the proportion of ears with recurrent (OR = 0.41, CI:0.11;1.57, p = 0.140) or residual (OR = 0.59, CI:0.23, 1.50, p = 0.207) disease did not show a significant difference, even though the odds were quite similar. The qualitative synthesis identified no significant difference in the secondary outcomes, but obliteration elongated the operation time. Conclusion Mastoid obliteration significantly decreased the proportion of residual and recurrent cholesteatoma in pooled analyses compared to the CWU technique with low-quality of data.

AB  - Background: There is ongoing debate over the optimal surgical approach for cholesteatoma treatment1-5. The aim of this review was to determine whether canal-wall down with mastoid obliteration is associated with favourable outcomes compared to either canal-wall down without obliteration or canal-wall up. The primary outcome was cholesteatoma reoccurrence with secondary outcomes including otorrhoea, reoperation and patient-reported outcome measures.Methods: Medline, Embase, Cochrane databases and clinicaltrials.gov were searched for studies reporting out-comes of patients undergoing primary CWD-MO for cholesteatoma and directly compared with CWD and CWU mastoidectomies. Data were collated and meta-analysis performed.Results: 2379 patients were included from 12 studies that met the inclusion criteria. CWD-MO was found to be associated with significantly less risk of recurrence when compared to CWU (OR = 0.330 (95 % CI 0.191-0.570, p < 0.001). When compared to CWD, CWD-MO was associate with significantly lower incidence of persistent otorrhoea (OR 0.405 (95 % CI 0.232-0.706, p < 0.001) while the rates of recurrence were comparable (OR: 1.231 [95 % CI: 0.550-2.757] p = 0.613). Otorrhoea rates between CWD-MO and CWU were equivalent as was reoperation. Quality of life and hearing outcomes were variably reported.Conclusions: This systematic review demonstrates that CWD-MO technique achieves lower recurrence rates comparable to CWD approaches and superior to CWU, while offering improved long-term control of otorrhoea. The final procedural choice should be decided based on surgeon experience, skill set and individual patient factors. To address the risk of selection bias, a randomised controlled trial is needed to answer this important research question.

AB  - Endonasal ballon dilatation of the Eustachian tube (BET) is a promising treatment for Eustachian tube dysfunction with encouraging results over the last years in adults. In addition, in children, single studies demonstrated promising results, but revealed the necessity for broader and additional studies. Our retrospective analysis presents outcomes with BET in children with chronic obstructive dysfunction of the Eustachian tube, showing resistance to the conventional therapy after adenotomy with paracentesis or grommets (ventilation tubes). The data of 52 children, having undergone BET from April 2011 to April 2016, were retrospectively evaluated. Most children in our study presented middle ear effusion (47%), adhesive (21%), chronic otitis media (13%), or recurrent acute otitis media (11%). In 24 (37%) children, we combined BET with a paracentesis, in 5 (8%) patients with a tympanoplasty type I and in 3 (5%) patients with a type III. All children were assessed using an audiogram, tympanometry, and tubomanometry (50 mbar) before and after BET. In addition, we evaluated the results of the Lubecker questionnaire, which we performed before and after BET. The childrens' ear-related and quality of life-related symptoms, such as pressure equalization, ear pressure, hearing loss, pain and limitation in daily life, and satisfaction pre- and postoperatively, were analyzed. In the majority of patients, we could see an improvement in the ear pressure, hearing loss, limitation in daily life, and satisfaction with recurrent inflammations, underlined by better outcomes in the tubomanometry and the tympanogram. BET in children is a safe, efficient, and promising method to treat chronic tube dysfunction, especially as a second line treatment, when adenotomy, paracentesis, or grommets failed before.

AB  - Objective To compare postoperative pain and analgesic use in children following transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES) vs non-transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (non-TEES). Study Design Prospective case series. Setting Tertiary care center. Methods Surveys using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale and recording the frequency and dosage of consumed analgesics were administered prospectively to caregivers of children undergoing otologic surgery between May 2018 to February 2020. Pain intensity and medication use were recorded twice daily for 6 days, starting on postoperative day 0. Mean pain scores and mean number of consumed analgesic doses were compared between groups. Results Survey response rate was 57.9%. Among 53 patients who completed the survey, 35 (66.0%) underwent TEES and 18 (34.0%) underwent non-TEES. Mean pain ratings on postoperative days 0 and 1 were significantly lower among children undergoing TEES (2.2 and 2.1) vs non-TEES (4.0 and 4.1), P = .045 and P = .008, respectively (Mann-Whitney U test). The mean pain ratings across the 6 days were similar in TEES (1.7) and non-TEES (2.6) (P = .140, Mann-Whitney U test). The mean number of analgesic doses consumed per half-day over the 6 days was significantly lower among children undergoing TEES (0.3) vs non-TEES (0.6; P = .049, Mann-Whitney U test). Conclusion Postoperative pain following TEES and non-TEES in children was overall low. Children undergoing TEES had a small but statistically significant decrease in pain on postoperative days 0 and 1 and decreased use of pain medications compared to non-TEES.

AB  - Purpose Evaluate perception of preparedness for independent practice following the Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery residency program of Universite de Montreal. Methods Cross-sectional survey of graduates from the past 10 years. Participants were asked about their level of confidence at the end of their residency for various procedures using a 5-point Likert scale. Results 7 out of 27 procedures were mastered by most physicians at the end of residency. The highest confidence level was in head and neck surgery (4 out of 5 procedures with a mean confidence level of 4 or higher) and lowest in laryngology and otology (both having 3 procedures with a median confidence level of 2 or less). The lowest confidence level was seen in ossiculoplasty and thyroplasty, being the only procedures to have a mean confidence level below 2. The highest scores were seen in superficial parotidectomy, direct microlaryngoscopy and trans-oral drainage of an abscess. These latter were the only procedures in which 100% of the respondent had a confidence level of 4 or 5. Discussion It has recently been suspected that these fields were potential weaknesses, so adjustments were made. This study provides new information to improves the curriculum. Recent and incoming change's impact on resident's confidence will be assessed in the future. Conclusion This study highlights procedures and Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery subspecialties in which more surgical exposure or curriculum changes could increase resident's confidence and skills as part of a comprehensive Otorhinolaryngology practice.

AB  - Implantable auditory devices (IADs) are a viable hearing restoration option for patients with hearing loss. Conditions such as chronic otitis externa, congenital aural atresia, and chronic otitis media can be treated with a variety of implants. Progressive disease are also amenable to restoration with IADs, providing stabilized hearing. When considering the best rehabilitative options, the patient's preference, ease of surgery, ease of device use, quality of life, and the traditional alternatives (such as ossiculoplasty, hearing aids, and cochlear implants) need to be considered. Patients with conductive, mixed, and sensorineural losses, mild to severe in nature, can be candidates for IADs.

AB  - Carcinoma of the external auditory canal (EAC) is an unusual head and neck malignancy. The pathophysiology of these tumors is different from other skin lesions because of their anatomical and functional characteristics. Early-stage carcinoma of the EAC can be generally cured by surgical treatment, and reconstruction of the EAC with a tympanoplasty can help to retain hearing, thus improving the patients' quality of life. In this study, we present two cases of early-stage carcinoma of the EAC treated by canal reconstruction using skin grafts after lateral temporal bone resection. A rolled-up skin graft with a temporalmuscle flap was useful for keeping the form and maintaining the postoperative hearing. An adequate size of the skin graft and blood supply to the graft bed are important for achieving a successful operation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate platelet-rich fibrin's potential role as packing material in both the middle ear and external auditory canal.
   METHODS: Twenty-nine patients undergoing transcanal endoscopic type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty were included in this controlled prospective clinical study. Patients were randomly assigned to platelet-rich fibrin (n = 14) or absorbable gelatine (n = 15) groups. Preoperative and postoperative pure-tone audiometry results, graft healing rates, tympanometry values, and Glasgow Benefit Inventory scores were compared.
   RESULTS: No significant postoperative complications were observed and the graft intake rate was 100% in both groups. Mean aft-bone gap gain was 9.82 +/- 4 dB HL in the postoperative first month and 10.08 +/- 491 dB HL in the sixth postoperative month in the platelet-rich fibrin group. There was no statistically significant difference between the postoperative air-bone gap gains of the groups in the first (P= .537) and sixth month (P= .723) controls. There was no statistically significant difference in compliance (P = .453) between groups. The physical benefit scores of the Glasgow Benefit Inventory were significantly higher in the platelet-rich fibrin group (P= .01).There was no difference in general and sodas benefit scores (P> .05).
   CONCLUSION: As a middle and external auditory canal packing agent, platelet-rich fibrin was as successful as absorbable gelatine in transcanal endoscopic cartilage tympanoplasty with similar functional results and graft healing rate.

AB  - This review presents a comprehensive history of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of the revolutionary application of machine learning (ML) to medical research and clinical utilization, particularly for the benefit of researchers interested in the application of ML in otology. To this end, we discuss the key components of ML-input, output, and algorithms. In particular, some representation algorithms commonly used in medical research are discussed. Subsequently, we review ML applications in otology research, including diagnosis, influential identification, and surgical outcome prediction. In the context of surgical outcome prediction, specific surgical treatments, including cochlear implantation, active middle ear implantation, tympanoplasty, and vestibular schwannoma resection, are considered. Finally, we highlight the obstacles and challenges that need to be overcome in future research.

AB  - Objective: To identify a consensus on the postoperative barorestrictions after stapes surgery and to examine the clinical barotrauma experience within this patient population encountered by the surveyed physicians.
   Data Source: A 34-item survey was developed, allowing for detailed analysis of physician demographic data, practice characteristics, surgical experience, and clinical experience with barotrauma after stapes surgery. The postoperative restrictions addressed by the survey included those for air travel, snorkeling, and scuba diving. Recommendations for the use of ventilation tubes and hyperbaric oxygen therapy were investigated as well.
   Study Selection: Surveys were mailed to 419 active members of the American Otological Society and the American Neurotology Society as listed in the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) 1994-1995 Conjoint Directory. A total of 284 (67.8%) surveys were returned, of which 53 were not sufficiently completed and were excluded in the statistical analysis.
   Data Extraction: The demographic data and clinical experience were analyzed to determine statistical association with the postoperative recommendations using chi(2) or Fisher's exact tests. The kappa statistic was used as a measure of consistency between physicians' recommended restriction for a specific activity after a stapedectomy or stapedotomy.
   Conclusion: No consensus was demonstrated as to restrictions from activities such as air travel, snorkeling, or scuba diving. Despite this lack of consensus, no significant difference was demonstrated in the prevalence of barotrauma reported within the responding physicians' practices based on their individual recommendations for these activities.

AB  - To investigate individual stapes surgery practice in the UK, a retrospective study was conducted by postal questionnaire to all 'assumed' stapes-performing otologists. 225 questionnaires were sent out to practicing otologists in the UK. 184 replies (81.8 %) indicated that 134 (72.9 %) otologists perform stapes surgery [stapedectomy (8.2 %), stapedotomy (91.0 %) or other (0.8 %)]. The '6-10 stapes operation per year' category is the most common, with most using general anaesthetic (GA) (78.3 %). Unilateral surgery is advised in 89.6 %, and 96.3 % perform second-side surgery, with all advising the option of a hearing aid prior to surgery. The majority (88.1 %) would fit the prosthesis after removing the stapes, with the top three prostheses being Causse, Smart and Teflon (as described by respondents). 42.5 % always use a vein graft or fat to cover the fenestration, 9.3 % use a laser and 48.5 % carry out the surgery as a day case. For an overhanging facial nerve (less than 50 % of the footplate obscured), the majority stated that it would depend whether they would abandon surgery. 25.4 % have encountered a 'gusher' and 83.6 % would recommend revision surgery. 82.8 % have a registrar present when carrying out stapes operations, but 69.4 % only offer training to trainees with an otological interest. In the UK, stapedotomy is the preferred technique. Most prefer the Causse prosthesis, general anaesthesia and an inpatient stay. Hearing aids are advised prior to surgery. Day-case and inpatient practice is about equal. 'Gushers' are encountered rarely. Revision surgery is advised if a conductive loss returns. Flying is recommended from 6 weeks. Most otologists are willing to teach trainees with an otological interest.

AB  - Purpose of review The incidence of blast injuries has increased, and the ear is the highest risk organ. Ear injury induced by blast exposure is important in both military and civilian conditions. The permanent hearing loss caused by blast exposure is associated with a decline in the quality of life. In this review, I describe recent therapeutic strategies for each of the ear pathologies caused by blast exposure. Recent findings For tympanic membrane perforation after blast exposure, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been used as a less invasive treatment to repair the tympanic membrane. The closure rates of tympanic membrane perforations treated with bFGF were reported to be comparable to those following conventional tympanoplasty. For sensorineural hearing loss after blast exposure, treatment with neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) or neurotrophin-3, antioxidants, and Atoh1 induction have recently been applied, and some of them were considered for clinical application. Recent advances of therapeutics for blast-induced hearing loss, based on their pathologies, have been outlined. There are several promising therapeutic approaches for both middle and inner ear disorders after blast exposure; however, further research is needed to establish new treatments for blast-induced hearing dysfunction.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the quality of perceived sound after stapedotomy over a 1-year follow-up period focussing on incidence of dysacusis, particularly distorted sound perception (DSP). DSP was assessed by (i) determination of the frequencies and hearing level that such perceptions are elicited by pure tones (pure-tone-evoked distorted sound perception, PTE-DSP), a novel psychoacoustic measurement introduced in this paper, and (ii) assessment of patient-reported occurrence of DSP using the Amsterdam Post Operative Sound Evaluation (APOSE) questionnaire (APOSE-DSP).Design: Prospective study.Study sample: Patients (n=23) with otosclerosis undergoing stapedotomy.Results: An air-bone gap of <20dB was achieved in 100% of the patients. Three weeks postoperatively, 48% of the patients reported measured PTE-DSP and 39% of the patients experienced APOSE-DSP. The PTE-DSP significantly decreased during the 1-year follow-up period (p=0.03). Postoperatively, APOSE-DSP was associated with a smaller benefit (improvement in air conduction; p=0.03), yet, a lower bone conduction pure-tone average was associated with PTE-DSP (p=0.006).Conclusions: DSP after stapedotomy is associated with a smaller benefit 3months after stapedotomy. DSP commonly occur after stapedotomy, but decrease over time. This is important information to be included in patient counselling before stapedotomy.

AB  - Objective:To compare outcomes of transcanal endoscopic tympanoplasty reconstructed using pretragal superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) fascia versus temporalis fascia.Study Design:Retrospective patient review and posttreatment questionnaire survey.Setting:Tertiary referral center.Patients:Sixty adult patients with chronic dry tympanic membrane perforation.Interventions:Patients underwent transcanal endoscopic type I tympanoplasty reconstructed using the SMAS fascia between September 2017 and May 2018; outcomes were compared with a matched cohort of patients where the temporalis fascia was used.Main Outcome Measures:Tympanic membrane closure rate, audiogram threshold, duration of procedure, and donor site scar satisfaction survey.Results:Sixty patients were included in this study and were evenly divided into the SMAS and temporalis fascia groups. These cohorts were matched for age, sex, side of lesion, perforation size, and preoperative hearing level. The closure rate was 96.7% (29/30) and 93.3% (28/30) (p=1.0), mean hearing gain was 8.36.4dB versus 8.2 +/- 7.1dB for air-conduction (p=0.970) and 7.6 +/- 5.1dB versus 8.2 +/- 6.8dB for air-bone gap (p=0.716), and mean surgical duration was 137.3 +/- 23.0 versus 132.2 +/- 27.3minutes (p=0.432) for the SMAS and temporalis fascia groups, respectively; there were no statistically significant differences for all the parameters listed. The posttreatment questionnaire survey revealed significantly higher acceptance of the SMAS fascia method.Conclusion:This preliminary outcome report of SMAS fascia grafting in transcanal endoscopic type I tympanoplasty showed equivalent surgical outcomes and better cosmetic satisfaction compared with the temporalis fascia. The SMAS fascia is a reasonable alternative to conventional techniques for transcanal tympanoplasty.

AB  - Members of the American Otological Society and the American Neurotology Society were polled regarding stapes surgery and reparative granuloma. Of 467 questionnaires, 176 (38%) were returned, and 319,410 stapes cases were statistically analyzed: 329 reparative granulomas were reported after stapedectomy (incidence = 0.1%) and 29 after stapedotomy (incidence = 0.07%); 77 surgeons reported having encountered at least one reparative granuloma; and 50 surgeons related the occurrence of a reparative granuloma to a specific graft material. Gelfoam was the most common graft material reported when a reparative granuloma was encountered, followed by fat, and vertigo was the most frequently reported presenting symptom. Reported operative techniques as well as manifestations, management, and outcome are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To assess the role of the CT-scan in the preoperative evaluation of juvenile otosclerosis and to study additional outcome data.
   Design and setting: We performed a retrospective case series study from an academic referral hospital using data from 1992 to 2005.
   Patients and methods: We selected patients younger than 18-year-old who had undergone primary stapedectomy for otosclerosis among the 10 stapedectomies performed over the study period and analyzed the patients' systematic pre- and post-operative audiograms and CT-scan findings.
   Results: For this survey, complete data was available for 7 children, totaling 10 primary stapedectomies for otosclerosis. Their ages at diagnosis ranged from 10 to 17 years. In 4 children, CT-scan demonstrated bilateral findings typical of otosclerosis: poorly calcified foci near the fissula ante fenestram, associated with a hypodense edging surrounding the labyrinthine capsule in 2 children. The youngest patient had no CT-scan abnormalities. Stapedectomy was performed in one case and laser stapedotomy in 9 cases. Seven children were immediately improved following surgery and no postoperative facial palsy or prolonged vertigo was reported. The mean (S.D.) postoperative ABG was 6.5 dB (+/-3.7). The mean closure was 19 dB (+/-11.2). The mean change in high-tone bone conduction level was 1.8 dB (+/-7.5). Six children had a postoperative ABG less than 10 dB while in one, the ABG was inferior to 20 dB.
   Conclusion: Preoperative CT-scan is useful for the preoperative diagnosis of otosclerosis in children. The images seen must be distinguished from other footplate pathologies or deformities of the ossicular chain which are often associated with poorer surgical results. This survey provides additional evidence that stapes surgery is an effective procedure for treating juvenile otosclerosis. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Until recently, postimplant meningitis was infr-equently reported and felt to be uncommon. However, in the spring of 2002, there was a sudden increase in the number of reported cases of postimplantation meningitis in both Europe and North America.
   Objective: Because complications of surgery often tend to be underreported, we decided to survey all cochlear implant cen-ters in North America to determine the true incidence of postimplant meningitis and to learn more about the demographics and risk factors.
   Study Design: We conducted a prospective study. A survey instrument was designed asking surgeons the number of implants performed and whether they had seen any cases of meningitis after implantation. If the answer was affirmative, they were asked to respond to a 20-point questionnaire. This instrument was sent to all 401 cochlear implant cen-ters in North America.
   Setting: Tertiary care referral centers.
   Patients: We studied all patients having received cochlear implants in North America.
   Main Outcome Measures: Number of cases of postimplant meningitis, age of patients, device used, cochlear and temporal bone abnormalities, treatment, and outcomes.
   Results: Meningitis is more common than previously thought. Risk factors included young age, cochlear dysplasia, temporal bone abnormalities, and the use of a two-part electrode system. This survey led to the involvement by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in a much more intensive analysis of a subset of the cases.
   Conclusions: Postimplant meningitis is related to patient, surgical, and device factors. By being aware of the risk factors involved, adhering to sound surgical principles such as packing of the cochleostomy with soft tissue, appropriately vaccinating patients, and eliminating any potentially traumatic electrode arrays, the incidence of meningitis should be significantly diminished.

AB  - This study retrospectively investigated the reasons for failure to dry the ear after primary radical mastoidectomy for chronic otitis media. In this retrospective study, we analyzed the main causes of dry ear failure in 43 patients (46 ears) who underwent radical mastoidectomy. We found that inadequate exposure of the mastoid cavity, incomplete removal of pathological tissues, and poor drainage of the surgical cavity were the main reasons for failure of radical mastoidectomy. Lesions in the tympanic ostium of the eustachian tube and incorrect selection of surgical techniques could also cause dry ear failure. Revision surgery based on preoperative temporal bone computed tomography and intraoperative surgical findings could achieve dry ear in 100% of cases and no complications were observed. In patients who underwent tympanoplasty, there was a significant postoperative decrease in the decibel hearing level for the air conduction threshold and air-bone gap (P < .05). Based on the reasons for failure, the corresponding treatment was undertaken to achieve dry ears during revision surgery.

AB  - Objectives: We evaluated the surgical outcome of tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media in post-irradiated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
   Methods: Nineteen ears were treated in 15 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who had undergone radiotherapy in this retrospective clinical series. Only patients with simple perforations of the tympanic membrane and normal or near-normal eustachian tube function were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent type 1 tympanoplasty.
   Results: All patients had been treated with radiotherapy of 64.8 to 81.0 Gy. The intervals between radiotherapy and surgery ranged from 17 months to 20 years. The tympanic membranes in 10 of 19 ears were intact after surgery. Otorrhea had subsided in 11 ears (58%), and the incidence of otorrhea was decreased in 6 ears (32%). Thirteen of the 15 patients (86.7%) reported that their quality of life had improved.
   Conclusions: Surgical intervention benefits some patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma with chronic otitis media resulting from radiotherapy.

AB  - Objective: Patulous eustachian tube (PET) can have a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life. Previous work has demonstrated that temporarily mass loading and stiffening the tympanic membrane significantly reduces these symptoms. This study examined KTP laser myringoplasty (LM) and cartilage tympanoplasty (CT) as a means to manipulate the tympanic membrane to alleviate PET symptoms.
   Study Design: Retrospective case review.
   Setting: Academic tertiary care referral hospital.
   Patients: Patients (n = 20) were identified from the senior authors' (M.B.) specialty eustachian tube disorders clinic. Patients met previously established diagnostic criteria for PET. All patients had a clinically apparent flaccid segment of the eardrum and had symptom improvement after simple mass loading of their eardrum in the clinic.
   Interventions: Patients in this study received either KTP LM (10 patients, 15 ears) or CT (10 patients, 11 ears) to treat their flaccid eardrum segment in an attempt to alleviate PET symptoms.
   Main Outcome Measures: Preoperative and postoperative questionnaire scores and tympanometry measurements were compared.
   Results: Patients undergoing CT for PET had a significant reduction in their symptoms of autophony (p <= 0.001), conducted breath sounds (p = 0.001), and aural fullness (p = 0.009). KTP LM did not significantly reduce symptoms.
   Conclusion: Cartilage tympanoplasty provides a safe and accessible surgical option for the treatment of PET and significantly reduces the symptoms of autophony, conducted breath sounds, and aural fullness. Further studies are needed to investigate whether addressing PET symptoms simultaneously from both the tympanic membrane and the eustachian tube orifice can improve patient symptoms even further.

AB  - Objective: To conduct a survey of the antiseptic preparations used for ear surgeries among otolaryngologists in Canada.
   Methods: An electronic survey was sent to active members of the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery via e-mail. Questions included the use of antiseptic, choice of preparation solution, duration of preparation, use of a barrier method, and compliance with hospital protocol changes.
   Results: The e-mail was received by 253 otolaryngologists, and 85 completed the survey. Four of 85 respondents did not perform tympanoplasty surgery and were not included in the analysis. Of those who performed tympanoplasty In = 81), 78 of the 81 respondents (96%) used an antiseptic preparation solution at surgery, whereas 3 respondents (4%) did not. Sixty-six of the 77 respondents (86%) used aqueous povidone-iodine, 4 (5%) used a chlorhexidine-based preparation, 3 (4%) used an alcohol-based solution, 3 (4%) used others, and 1 answered "I don't know." Thirty-eight of 75 (29%) respondents used a barrier method, 23 (31%) answered "always," 18 (24%) answered "sometimes," and 5 (7%) answered "I don't know." When asked if they would comply with a hypothetical hospital policy to use chlorhexidine in ear surgery, 15 of 79 (19%) respondents agreed, whereas 64 (81%) disagreed. Among the aqueous povidone-iodine users In = 66), 7 (11%) agreed to change to chlorhexidine.
   Conclusions: There is a wide variation in practice in the use of surgical preparation solution among otolaryngologists performing ear surgery. Surgeons must be vigilant to avoid ototoxicity. A national society consensus on appropriate preparation solutions for ear surgery would minimize patients' risk and minimize future medicolegal actions.

AB  - Objective To describe the resident experience with respect to key indicator cases for each year of training. Study Design Multi-institution, cross-sectional assessment. Methods Using an electronic survey, current otolaryngology residents were solicited to complete a survey regarding their experiences with the key indicator cases to that point. The survey was sent to this cohort in the winter of 2017-2018. Results Three hundred and three residents responded, with 293 completing the survey. Twenty-three percent were PGY1, 19% PGY2, 21% PGY3, 18% PGY4, and 19% PGY5 or higher. The majority of residents progress from resident assistant as a PGY2, to resident surgeon as a PGY3 and self-assessed competent surgeon as a PGY4 for the majority of the key indicator cases. Less than 50% of the surveyed PGY5 residents had reached independent practice in all the key indicator cases, with stapedectomy (16%), rhinoplasty (18%), and paramedian forehead flap (14.5%) being the cases least frequently performed independently. Ninety-five percent of the respondent residents felt their program provided adequate training, but 20% of the respondents were either unsure or believed that they would be unable to perform all the key indicator cases by the completion of their training. Conclusions The majority of otolaryngology residents feel confident in their training, but experience with certain cases lags behind and may not currently be taught as resident level cases. These findings raise the question of whether the current key indicator cases are the best option for assessing breadth and depth of residency training. Level of Evidence NA

AB  - Objective:To examine opioid prescribing patterns and consumption among patients undergoing common otologic surgeries.Study Design:Retrospective cohort study with chart review and telephone survey.Setting:Tertiary academic medical center.Methods:Retrospective chart review and telephone survey of those undergoing tympanoplasty, tympanomastoidectomy, stapedectomy, and cochlear implantation in 2018. The survey consisted of questions regarding the details of the number of pills taken, duration of opioid use, subjective pain control, the use of over-the-counter pain medications, opioid disposal, and their history of substance abuse.Results:Sixty-one patients were able to be contacted and agreed to participate in the study. Fifty-nine (96.7%) stated that their pain was controlled, and 10 (16.4%) did not take any opioids postoperatively despite their prescription. The mean morphine milligram equivalent (MME) prescribed was 99.9 (44.3) and MME taken was 45.2 (SD 46.3) (p<0.001). Similarly, the mean number of pills prescribed was 17.8 (SD 8.6) and mean taken was 7.9 (SD 8.3) (p<0.001). Comparison between males and females regarding MME and pills prescribed and taken were not statistically significantly different (p>0.05). Analysis of the MME and pills prescribed and taken among the different surgeries (tympanoplasty, stapes surgery, tympanomastoidectomy, and cochlear implantation) revealed no statistically significant interactions (p>0.05). Pain control was achieved for 50% of patients with 5 pills (MME=25mg), for 75% with 12 pills (MME=60mg), and for 90% with 24 pills (MME=135mg).Conclusion:The opioid epidemic continues to be an ongoing issue in the United States, and prescription opioid abuse is a large contributor. There is increasing literature to suggest a practice of overprescribing in multiple surgical specialties. This same finding appears to be present in common otologic surgeries, where on average patients took less than half of the prescribed MME/pills, and 75% of patients had their pain controlled with 12 pills or fewer. Otolaryngologists performing otologic surgery should strongly consider adjusting their postoperative regimens to reflect these findings.Level of Evidence: 2b

AB  - Purpose We aimed to evaluate the speech intelligibility benefit in noise provided by stapedotomy in the treatment of unilateral otosclerosis. Methods We enrolled adults suffering from unilateral conductive hearing loss and followed them up until 9 months after surgery. The patients underwent a free field speech hearing evaluation using the French Matrix test before and after stapedotomy. Speech material was sent to the front of the patients (S0) and noise was presented either at the front (N0), or at the operated ear (N-90) or at the non-operated ear (N + 90). The speech intelligibility benefit in noise was assessed by comparing Squelch effect (SE), Head shadow effect (HS) and Binaural redundancy (BR) before and after surgery. SE was measured as the difference in speech reception thresholds (SRT) between S0N + 90 situations before and after surgery, HS as the difference in SRT between S0N + 90 and S0N-90 situations, and BR as the difference in SRT between S0N0 situations before and after surgery. In addition, two quality of life's questionnaires were completed by patients to evaluate their discomfort. Results Among 25 patients, 19 were followed up during 9 months, 4 were excluded and 2 were lost for the following-up. Stapedotomy provided a restoration of SE of 3.7 dB SNR (p < 0.001) and a BR gain of 1.8 dB SNR (p < 0.001). HS did not show any statistical variation after surgery (p = 0.077). Finally, the questionnaires showed a residual hearing discomfort. Conclusion Stapedotomy provided a binaural benefit with the restoration of the SE and BR but which remained lower than in the normal-hearing population.

AB  - The objective of this study was to examine the outcome of unilateral stapes surgery in one patient group with bilateral hearing loss and one group with unilateral hearing loss. The patients' own estimations of improvement in hearing ability and the occurrence of other ear-related symptoms were examined retrospectively and in a follow-up study. Ninety-five of 123 patients operated for otosclerosis in only one ear between 1987 and 1992 responded to a follow-up examination. Observed audiometric findings and changes thereof, along with the patients' own estimations of their hearing handicap pre- and postoperatively, and the occurrence of other ear-related symptoms were studied. Despite good surgical results (closure of air-bone gap within 20 dB in 94%), 33% of the patients had severe hearing disabilities postoperatively, and many of these patients needed further amplification with a hearing aid. Mild dizziness occurred in 33% of the patients postoperatively and did not decrease over lime. Discomfort in the operated ear due to strong sounds was reported in 20%. Change in sound quality occurred in 80% of the operated ears, but tended to disappear over time. From the results of this study it may be concluded that surgery in one ear only, leaving the other ear with poor hearing, is not an optimal hearing rehabilitation of patients with otosclerosis. It is important endevour to achieve bilateral hearing in order to give the patient good social hearing. Postoperative dizziness and unpleasant hearing quality do occur frequently, and the patients need to be informed about these problems preoperatively.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate pure-tone audiometric results in otosclerosis patients undergoing revision stapes surgery following previous middle ear interventions. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed in a tertiary referral center. Consecutive otosclerosis patients who underwent revision stapes surgeries, following previous middle ear interventions, for persistent conductive hearing loss, recurrent conductive hearing loss, or vertigo and had available postoperative pure-tone audiometry were included. Mean pre- and postoperative air conduction, bone conduction, and air-bone gap averaged over 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz were obtained. Audiometric outcomes were obtained at 7 weeks postoperatively. Results: In total, 63 consecutive otosclerosis patients who underwent 66 revision stapes surgeries were included. Air-bone gap improved significantly with a mean gain of 19 dB (95% CI, 15-22). Air conduction improved significantly with a mean gain of 18 dB (95% CI, 14-23). Bone conduction did not change significantly, with a mean deterioration of 0 dB (95% CI, -2 to 1). Air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less was achieved in 38% of cases and to 20 dB or less in 80% of cases. Indication for surgery, previous type of procedure, primary cause of failure, and current surgical technique were not significantly associated with air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less. Indication for surgery and primary cause of failure were associated with one another. Conclusions: Compared to the available literature, a slightly larger gain in air conduction and air-bone gap was achieved in our study. Air-bone gap closure to 10 dB or less was achieved less often in our study.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the economic viability of stapes surgery in Germany. We compared the cost of the operation to the retail value and average cost of a lifelong supply of hearing aids.
   Study design: Retrospective study.
   Setting: Tertiary referral centre.
   Patients: One hundred and sixty-four consecutive cases of primary stapedotomy performed on patients with otosclerosis at our institution served as the representative group for the calculation. The post-operative air-bone gap average at the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz was less than 10 dB for 62 per cent of the patients, and less than 20 dB for 92 per cent of the patients. There was a post-operative sensorineural hearing loss in 1.2 per cent of the patients.
   Results: Analysis showed that, even for an elderly patient aged 65 years with a life expectancy of 15 years, the cost of a lifelong supply of hearing aids was greater than that of a stapedotomy procedure. Based on our group of patients, the stapedotomy procedure proved to be (sic)800000 K cheaper than treatment with an averagely priced hearing aid. The economic benefit was still present when taking into account possible revision surgery in 5-10 per cent of cases, and also when, in addition to the surgery, a post-operative hearing aid was required, in for example 20 per cent of cases.
   Conclusion: Stapes surgery is economically beneficial for the individual patient as well as for the general patient cohort, irrespective of age. The stapedotomy procedure also prevents the known disadvantages of conventional hearing aids, thus improving the patient's quality of life.

AB  - Objective: To demonstrate that surgeons who perform stapedectomies derive intrinsic enjoyment from the procedure. Subjects: An experimental group of 174 otologists/neurotologists who possibly perform stapedectomy, one control group of 145 head/neck oncologists who possibly perform parotidectomy, and a second control group of 365 pediatric otolaryngologists who possibly perform tonsillectomy. Intervention: Observational study using four-question anonymous surveys distributed by electronic mail. Outcome Measures: Responses to surveys by participants during a four-week period. Results: During the four-week survey periods, 84/174 neurotologists (48%) responded, while 33/145 oncologists (23%), and 87/365 pediatric otolaryngologists (24%) responded. Seventy-six of the 80 neurotologists who still performed stapedectomies (95%) enjoyed performing it, slightly more than the 30 of the 33 oncologists who still performed parotidectomies (91%), and appreciably more than the 67/87 pediatric otolaryngologists who still performed tonsillectomies (77%). Twenty-three neurotologists (30%) would sacrifice vacation time to perform additional stapedectomies, slightly more than 8 oncologists (27%) for additional parotidectomies, and more than the 7 pediatric otolaryngologists (10%) for additional tonsillectomies. Ten (13%) of the neurotologists, three (9%) of the oncologists, and one (2%) of the pediatric otolaryngologists would sacrifice five or more vacation days to perform more of the procedures. Conclusions: Our survey suggests that stapedectomy is intrinsically enjoyable.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the short-term (postoperative), medium-term (5 years), and long-term (10 and 15 years) audiometric results of patients who underwent stapedotomy and to determine specific factors associated with better postoperative outcomes. Methods: This study is a retrospective case review of 486 ears with surgically confirmed stapes fixation who underwent microscopic small fenestra stapedotomy. Preoperative, postoperative, and medium- and long-term air conduction (AC), bone conduction (BC), and air-bone gap (ABG) were assessed. Postoperative factors associated with better postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Results: At 10- and 15-year follow-ups, ABG, AC, and BC were significantly deteriorated but clinically preserved in comparison with postoperative results. According to a multiple quantile regression, younger age was associated with better postoperative results at 0.25 kHz (p = 0.003) and 4 kHz (p = 0.028) and a smaller preoperative ABG was associated with better audiometric results at 0.25 kHz (p = 0.048), 0.5 kHz (p = 0.001), and 4 kHz (p = 0.001). In addition, younger age (p = 0.001 for AC and p < 0.001 for BC) and preoperative AC PTA (p < 0.001 for AC) were significantly associated with better postoperative AC and BC PTA. Conclusions: Stapedotomy surgery provides short-, medium-, and long-term hearing benefits in our studied cohort. ABG, AC, and BC thresholds obtained after the surgery are clinically preserved in 5-, 10-, and 15-year follow-ups, with an age-expected BC deterioration. Smaller preoperative ABG and younger age were positive predictors for better postoperative ABG. Future research should address long-term subjective and quality of life outcomes.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate hearing outcome after stapedotomy in patients with Otosclerosis.
   Methods: This cross sectional study was carried out from July 2017 to January 2019 in National Institute of ENT, Unit V.
   About 22 patients with Otosclerosis were included in this study. Diagnosis of Otosclerosis was based on the history, medical status with Otoscopy, Tuning fork tests and Audiometric tests. We compiled data on the pre and post operative air-bone gap (ABG) at 0.5, 1, 2 KHZ. The ABG was Calculated using AC and BC thresholds on the same audiogram.
   Post operative hearing gain was then Calculated from the ABG before the operation minus the ABG of the last follow up examination.
   Results: In this study most of the cases were age group 14-30 years (72.7%), female (54.5%). Most common symptoms was progressive hearing loss, tinnitus (77.8%).The average pre-operative hearing loss in this study was (AC) was 48.31 +/- 7.68. The average post opt. hearing (AC) at follow up was 28.95 +/- 10.30 with an average hearing gain of 15.40 +/- 8.53 dB which was significant. The average pre-operative ABG was 28.99 dB +/- 8.10. The average post opt. ABG was analyzed at 1 follow up showed ABG 13.18 +/- 8.09 dB which was found to be significant.
   Conclusion: Stapedotomy is an effective surgical procedure for the treatment of otosclerosis which leads to improvement in patient's quality of life. A favorable hearing outcome can be obtained by the combination of experienced hands with minimal surgical trauma and appropriate surgical technique.

AB  - Reconstruction of the external auditory canal (EAC) after resection of carcinoma has become widely performed in combination with tympanoplasty to retain hearing ability, thus improving quality of life. Although skin grafting has been commonly performed, stenosis, infection and delayed wound healing often occur postoperatively. Local flaps can cause less stenosis, but the size and mobility are limited. For preventing stenosis and osteoradionecrosis after postoperative radiation, super-thin as well as durable resurfacing is required.
   We present two cases of reconstruction of the EAC using a super-thin free superficial circumflex iliac perforator (SCIP) flap. The flap was elevated as a super-thin flap primarily and inset into the defect as a tube. The flap survived completely without stenosis, infection or osteoradionecrosis even after postoperative radiation therapy. As this flap can securely cover the important structures, causes less stenosis and can endure postoperative radiation therapy, we believe that this method could be an option for reconstruction after resection of EAC cancers.

AB  - Although the basic principles of ear surgery have already been accepted, there is no scientific evidence on the outcome parameters of the techniques of operations. A lot of trends on this question are described in the literature, however, in daily work practicing doctor has got used to rely on own knowledge and experience. Range of preoperative diagnostic procedures varies and frequently depends on personal preferences of a doctor. We made an analysis of opinion among domestic otolaryngologists on the basic questions about preoperative diagnostics, usage of different types of grafts and prostheses by means of a questionnaire. Also we compared the results with a similar survey carried out in Europe.
   Distinctions in opinions of the specialists were traced during discussion of questions concerning the choice of graft for Miringoplasty and Tympanoplasty, amount of preoperative diagnostics, postoperative care of the patients and terms of control of bone conduction.
   Statistical analysis of the survey revealed main points of controversy among otologists, which were caused first of all by the lack of technical equipment, and of course, by the difference in professional knowledge level of the surgeons. In our work the basic results of the given comparative analysis are stated. We hope that this analysis will contribute to standardize concepts in otology to facilitate a safe, efficient, and effective standard of care for our patients.

AB  - One hundred sixty-hive otosclerotic patients who underwent a stapedotomy between October 1991 and April 1994 were examined after experiencing postoperative vertigo. Twenty-eight complained of dizziness. In sixteen patients, we observed vertigo and nystagmus only within the first six postoperative days; in these cases, special treatment was not necessary. However, in twelve patients in whom vertigo persisted even after their stay in the hospital, the problem seriously affected their quality of life and their return to work. In these cases, an individualized diagnostic and therapeutic procedure was indicated. Case reports demonstrate the usefulness of several diagnostic methods (analysis of the case history, audiogram, investigation of the vestibular system, and elimination of non-vestibular causes of vertigo. But only high-resolution computed tomography scans of the temporal bone showed definite results. Air bubbles at the end of the prothesis as indirect sign of perilymphatic fistula, bad position of the piston, new centers of otosclerosis, cicatrices, and in one case fracture of the prothesis. Ten of the twelve patients required revision surgery. In most patients with persisting vertigo following stapedotomy, revision surgery was justified. However, high-resolution computed tomography is recommended.

AB  - Introduction: Eustachian tube (ET) also known as pharyngotympanic tube connects nasopharynx with the middle ear. Evaluation of ET anatomy is aimed in patients with chronic otitis media. Materials and Methods: In a study of 53 patients, HRCT Temporal bone was done on 128 dual source simens somatom definition flash machine on 5mm cut section and tympanoplasty was carried out. Results: ET angle is one of the important factors for middle ear aeration. Outcome of tympanoplasty at 12th week was 88.7%. In the patients with vertical Eustachian Tube (i.e., more Eustachian Tube angle with the horizontal plane), better graft uptake in tympanoplasty was observed which was statistically significant. However, graft uptake did not correlate with the length of the Eustachian tube. Conclusion: It was concluded that on measuring ET length on HRCT, majority of the patients had bony length of 10-12 mm, cartilaginous length of 15-19 mm and total ET length of 28-32 mm. Majority of the patients had ET angle of 21-30 degrees with the hard palate.

AB  - Background Chronic otitis media treatment has evolved, with microscopic surgeries as the gold standard and endoscopic surgeries as a newer addition.
   Materials and Methods This retrospective study includes 209 patients who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty, utilizing both endoscopic and microscopic techniques, between January 2019 and December 2022 at a tertiary care institute in India. The study aims to compare hearing outcomes, graft uptake, hospital stay, postoperative pain, and cosmesis between the two groups.
   Results Mean AB gap closure was 17.09 + 5.98 dB in the endoscopic group and 16.74 + 5.05 dB in the microscopic group (P = 0.687). The duration of surgery was 79.26 +/- 17.37 min in the Endoscopic group and 91.92 +/- 15.35 min in the Microscopic group. (P = < 0.00001). The Endoscopic group experienced less post-operative pain, shorter hospital stay (P = < 0.00001, P= 0.0008), and exhibited better cosmetic outcomes (P = 0.00001) compared to the microscopic group.
   Conclusion Endoscopic tympanoplasty is a better alternative to microscopic tympanoplasty, delivering comparable hearing outcomes, shorter surgical duration, improved pain scores, and better cosmesis.

AB  - The tympanic membrane (TM) is a thin tissue able to efficiently collect and transmit sound vibrations across the middle ear thanks to the particular orientation of its collagen fibers, radiate on one side and circular on the opposite side. Through the combination of advanced scaffolds and autologous cells, tissue engineering (TE) could offer valuable alternatives to autografting in major TM lesions. In this study, a multiscale approach based on electrospinning (ES) and additive manufacturing (AM) was investigated to fabricate scaffolds, based on FDA approved copolymers, resembling the anatomic features and collagen fiber arrangement of the human TM. A single scale TM scaffold was manufactured using a custom-made collector designed to confer a radial macro-arrangement to poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) electrospun fibers during their deposition. Dual and triple scale scaffolds were fabricated combining conventional ES with AM to produce poly(ethylene oxide terephthalate)/poly (butylene terephthalate) block copolymer scaffolds with anatomic-like architecture. The processing parameters were optimized for each manufacturing method and copolymer. TM scaffolds were cultured in vitro with human mesenchymal stromal cells, which were viable, metabolically active and organized following the anisotropic character of the scaffolds. The highest viability, cell density and protein content were detected in dual and triple scale scaffolds. Our findings showed that these biomimetic micro-patterned substrates enabled cell disposal along architectural directions, thus appearing as promising substrates for developing functional TM replacements via TE.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of the study were to assess hearing-aid uptake in patients with otosclerosis 28-30 years after stapedectomy and to evaluate hearing-aid benefit to users. Design: A retrospective study was performed; it included a review of medical records and follow-up 28-30 years after surgery, including audiometry, clinical examination, structured interview, and a validated questionnaire, IOI-HA. Study sample: Sixty-five patients, who had undergone stapedectomy at a tertiary referral center in 1977-79. Results: In 95% of the subjects there was a theoretical need for hearing-aid amplification at follow-up; 46% of the subjects had no hearing aids, while 26% had unilateral and 28% bilateral hearing aids. Hearing sensitivity in the best ear predicted hearing-aid uptake. Of the subjects with a hearing aid, 94% were everyday users and 54% were full-time users (>8 hours/day). The subjects reported a high level of satisfaction (mean 4.5) and benefit (mean 4.2), but also residual activity limitations (mean 3.1). Conclusions: The study shows that there is an unmet need for long-term hearing rehabilitation among patients previously undergoing surgery for otosclerosis. The patients who were using hearing aids were generally very satisfied with their hearing aids, but they still reported residual activity limitations.

AB  - Objective We surveyed otolaryngology program directors (PDs) and recent otolaryngology residency graduates on the operative autonomy of graduating residents and their comfort with independent practice. Methods An anonymous survey was sent to otolaryngology PDs and recent graduates of training programs (members of the Young Physicians Section [YPS] of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation). Questions were developed around the 14 key indicator procedures (KIPs) defined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Results Fifty PDs (43% of PDs) and 152 recent graduates (6% of YPS members) responded. Over 90% of participating PDs felt their graduating residents were either somewhat or extremely comfortable performing 12 out of 14 KIPs. Among the 12 procedures PDs felt their graduating residents were comfortable performing, 57% to 95% of recent graduates also felt either somewhat or extremely comfortable performing them by graduation. Similarly, at least 90% of responding PDs felt their residents achieved meaningful autonomy in the last 2 months of residency prior to graduation for 11 of 14 KIPs. For these same 11 procedures, 74% to 95% of recent graduates indicated they achieved meaningful autonomy. The procedures that PDs and recent graduates felt required the most surgical assistance were ossiculoplasty/stapedectomy, rhinoplasty, and mastoidectomy. All PDs agreed or strongly agreed that graduating residents are comfortable operating and taking call as general otolaryngologists, compared to 86% and 93% of recent graduates. Conclusion Most PDs and recent graduates agree that residents are well-prepared for general otolaryngology practice with the exception of select KIPs. Level of evidence: 4.

AB  - Objective Equivalent outcomes, such as procedural safety and audiometry, have been reported between endoscopic ear surgery (EES) and microscopic ear surgery (MES). This study aims to determine if EES leads to decreased postoperative pain when compared with MES. Data Sources PubMed, OVID MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central from 2000 to 2020. Review Methods A systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and standardized bias assessment was performed. Studies containing original data on postoperative pain following EES and MES were included. Results Fourteen studies fulfilled eligibility: 7 retrospective studies, 6 randomized controlled trials, and 1 case series. Studies included surgery for cholesteatoma (n = 3), tympanoplasty/myringoplasty (n = 6), and stapedotomy (n = 5), pooling data from 974 patients. Postoperative pain was quantitatively described through a variety of numeric pain scores. Meta-analysis was performed on 11 studies. Among the 7 studies utilizing the numeric rating scale or visual analog scale, postoperative pain in the EES cohort was significantly lower than that of the MES cohort (standardized mean difference = -1.45 [95% CI, -2.05 to -0.85], P < .001). Similarly, pain scores were lower in the EES cohort among the 4 studies utilizing the Three Grades Pain Scale (odds ratio = 0.2 [95% CI, 0.09-0.45], P < .001). Additional qualitative strengths identified in EES included significant improvements in visualization, operative time, postoperative complications, and decreased need for canalplasty. Quality assessment indicated low to moderate risk of bias for all studies. Conclusion Meta-analysis confirms that EES results in significantly less postoperative pain when compared with MES. This surgical approach should be considered in the armamentarium of otologic surgeons, allowing for improved outcomes.

AB  - Objective: This study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of congenital cholesteatoma (CC) in Japan, via a nationwide survey using staging and classification criteria for middle ear cholesteatoma, as proposed by the Japan Otological Society (JOS).
   Methods: A nationwide survey regarding middle ear cholesteatoma treated in 2015 was performed. There were 1787 registrations from 74 facilities, among which, CC accounted for 12.9% (231 cases) of all middle ear cholesteatoma cases. The extent of the disease was classified according to the classification and staging of cholesteatoma proposed by JOS in 2015.
   Results: The age of the patients ranged from 1 to 55 years (mean, 8.2 years; median, 6 years; 149 ears of males; 82 ears of females). Among these cases, 105 (45.5%) were classified as stage I, 121 (52.4%) as stage II, and 5 (2.1%) as stage III, with no cases in stage IV. In the sub classification of stage I, 35 (33%), 43 (41%) and 27 (26%) ears were classified as stages I-a, I-b and I-c, respectively. Stage I-b (cholesteatoma confined to the posterior half of the tympanic cavity) was more frequent than stage I-a (the anterior half of tympanic cavity). Pre-operative hearing level of air-conduction was 20.5 dB for stage I-a, 34.5 dB for stage I-b, 30.5 dB for stage I-c, 38.6 dB for stage II, and 59.0 dB for stage III. The rate of missing stapes superstructure increased as the disease progressed. In the same way, the mastoid development lowered as the stage of the disease progressed. There were significant differences in the age at operation, preoperative hearing level, status of stapes, and major ossiculoplasty, between stage l-a and l-b.
   Conclusions: The current condition of CC in Japan was been evaluated; in particular, it was observed that the cases limited to the posterior part of tympanic cavity were not rare. The JOS stage classification based on the progression of the disease seemed simple and efficient. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Much debate exists over the management of mucosal chronic suppurative otitis media in children, with the majority of it centred around the correct timing to perform either a myringoplasty (an operative repair of the tympanic membrane) or type I tympanoplasty (reconstruction of the tympanic membrane when there is an intact and mobile ossicular chain). Further discussion will use the term tympanoplasty to mean both of the above definitions. We present the findings of a recent survey of UK ENT consultants questioning their opinions on various management aspects of mucosal CSOM in the paediatric population. We also present an extensive review of the literature to provide us with published evidence in order to analyse the results of the questionnaire.

AB  - Otosderosis is a human-specific ear disease characterised by complex bone-remodelling with multifactorial aetiology. It affects the bony labyrinth capsule and consequently fixates the stapes to the oval window rim. The fixation of the ossicular chain leads to a decrease in the middle ear's acoustic impedance-fitting and amplifier function that leads to conductive hearing loss. The process is progressive and when it involves the inner ear structures, it deteriorates the sensorineural function as well. The course of the illness can be prevented or delayed if hearing reconstructive surgery is performed on time. The development of stapes surgery spans the 20th century, and despite the major surgical steps - laid down by Shea and Marquet in the 1960s - are quite conservative, fine adjustments are still being made mainly due to technical progress. Several studies confirm that stapedotomy remained the first-to-offer therapeutic option in otosclerosis. With an adequate surgical technique, significant improvement can be achieved in the air conduction threshold, the air-bone gap may be minimalized or ceased over the speech frequencies, which significantly improves the quality of life of the patients. In this quest, we reviewed the Hungarian and the international literature as well in context with otosclerosis, with special attention to the newest methods in diagnostics and treatment management.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the results of revision radical cavity surgery with mastoid obliteration using a standardised grading scheme.
   Methods: A retrospective study was performed of 121 patients (122 ears) with chronically draining ears who underwent revision radical cavity surgery with mastoid obliteration between 2007 and 2013. Surgical indications, patient characteristics, pre- and post-operative Merchant grade, and surgical outcomes were recorded. The main outcome measures were presence of a dry ear, time for complete re-epithelialisation, presence of residual or recurrent disease, and need for revision surgery.
   Results: In the 5-year follow-up group (n = 31), dry ears were found in 97 per cent after 6 minor revisions and cholesteatoma-free ears were found in 97 per cent. In the total cohort, dry ears were found in 93 per cent after nine revisions and cholesteatoma-free ears were found in 98 per cent. The median time for complete re-epithelialisation was eight weeks. There were no major complications.
   Conclusion: In terms of the dry ear rate, residual cholesteatoma and time to complete epithelialisation, revision radical cavity surgery with mastoid obliteration produces very good results in concordance with published results, despite most patients suffering from very troublesome cavities prior to surgery.

Main Outcome Measures Percent of respondents performing preoperative testing with acoustic reflexes (ARs), electrocochleography, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials, and computed tomography (CT). Further analysis of those not ordering routine CT to determine whether imaging would be ordered for previous ear surgery, vestibular complaints, childhood hearing loss, AR inconsistent with otosclerosis, possible advanced otosclerosis, or atypical complaints, including autophony. Further subgroup analysis based on years in practice and practice setting (private versus academic). Results Most respondents (56.5%) had practiced more than 15 years and worked in academic settings (69.4%). Rates of routine use of preoperative AR, vestibular evoked myogenic potential, and electrocochleography were 80, 4.7, and 0%, respectively. There were no significant differences based on time in practice or practice settings. For CT, 35.3% reported routine use with a statistically significant difference between academic and private practice respondents (42.4% versus 19.2%, p = 0.040). For CT contingent on specific clinical factors, only AR inconsistent with otosclerosis showed a statistically significant difference between academic and private practice providers (85.3% versus 57.1%, p = 0.020). Conclusion Most otologists routinely obtain AR before stapedectomy. Academic providers more commonly order CT routinely and for AR inconsistent with otosclerosis. Most respondents not ordering routine CT ordered imaging in specific clinical scenarios. Overall, there is a high level of consistency in preoperative testing regardless of practice setting or time in practice.

AB  - Current therapeutic options for hearing loss rely on hearing aids, ossiculoplasty or cochlear implants. These devices have limitations, particularly in noisy acoustic environments. Therefore, interest in exploring aetiological treatments to improve not only auditory perception but also the quality of life of those affected is increasing. Gene therapy is a promising aetiological treatment that can fully restore auditory function. The success of gene therapy relies on the efficient delivery of therapeutic genes or genetic modifications to the cells of the inner ear that are designed to repair or replace defective genes and restore normal hearing function. Two main strategies for gene therapy involve the use of recombinant viral vectors and nonviral delivery vehicles. Owing to their excellent diffusion properties and compatibility with sensory cells, recombinant viral vectors, particularly adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), have dominated gene therapy in the cochlea. However, recombinant viral vectors have several drawbacks, such as limited transgene size, immunogenicity (particularly in neonates), and potential need for repeat administration. Nonviral vectors, such as cationic lipids and polymeric nanoparticles, are potential attractive alternatives. Nonviral vectors have several advantages, including low immunogenicity and unlimited transgene size. Recent studies have demonstrated significant auditory recovery in vivo using nonviral vectors in murine models. However, nonviral vectors are not as efficient as viral vectors in transferring genetic material. An alternative to nanoparticles is the use of other methods, such as electroporation. The main advantage of electroporation is that it can be used in combination with cochlear implantation and can target surface cells, but this method has a risk of cell damage. The goal of this review is to provide valuable insights into the current state of research on nonviral vectors for inner ear gene therapy and propose the exploration of innovative and effective gene therapy strategies for the treatment of hearing loss.

AB  - Objective. To identify the stapedotomy learning curve of two U.K. otolaryngologists. Study Design: A retrospective review of the outcome of first 100 stapedotomy operations by each surgeon. Included in the study was a postal survey of the incidence of stapes surgery by U.K. otolaryngologists. Setting. Two tertiary referral centers. Patients. All ears in which primary stapedotomy was performed for otosclerosis. Nonotosclerotic cases and malleus stapedotomy cases were excluded. Intervention: One surgeon used the technique of small fenestra stapedotomy with either a Teflon-wire or titanium piston but without vein graft interposition, whereas the second used the technique of stapedotomy with vein graft interposition and a Teflon piston. Main Outcome Measures. A moving average with a window of 15 dB was used to plot learning curves for the postoperative air-bone gaps. Using a postoperative air-bone gap of 20 dB or better as a definition of 'success,' the success rates with the increase in surgical experience of both surgeons were plotted on graphs, the learning curves. The end point of the learning curve was defined as the point where the curve reached its peak, and the results were sustainable. Results: There was no clear-cut end point in both learning curves, although it appears that there is a landmark point at 60 to 80 cases for both surgeons. Both surgeons also had one "dead ear" in their first 15 cases. The postal survey showed that some trainers only performed small numbers of stapes surgery, whereas some otolaryngologists who performed stapedotomies regularly were not trainers. Conclusions: The study supports a learning curve in stapes surgery. To maximize the training opportunity of trainee surgeons, it may be advisable for learning centers to form network to provide target training for the trainee who has demonstrated the necessary dexterity and temperament of an otologist.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Much controversy exists concerning the risk of inner ear barotrauma after stapes surgery in scuba and sky divers. Uniform consensus has not been established regarding poststapedectomy barorestrictions. The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the prevalence of adverse auditory and/or vestibular sequelae in patients after stapedectomy related to scuba and sky diving, and (2) to offer recommendations on barometric exposure after stapes surgery.
   STUDY DESIGN: Survey questionnaires were mailed to 2222 patients who had undergone stapedectomies at a single tertiary otologic referral center between 1987 and 1998. Two hundred eight of the initial 917 respondents (22.7%) had snorkeled, scuba, or sky dived after stapes surgery, and 140 of these responded to a second questionnaire detailing dive protocols, otologic symptoms, and their relationship to the diving activities. Of the 140, 28 had scuba or sky dived. Their survey data were analyzed and their medical records were reviewed.
   RESULTS: Four of the 22 scuba divers (18.1%) experienced otologic symptoms at the time of diving. These included otalgia on descent (3/22; 13.6%), tinnitus (1/22; 4.5%), and transient vertigo on initial submersion (1/22; 4.5%). One patient had sudden sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo develop 3 months after scuba diving, which he related to noise exposure. He was subsequently found to have a perilymph fistula, which was successfully repaired. Of the 9 patients who sky dived, 2 patients (22.2%) reported otologic symptoms during the dive. No significant diving-related long-term effects indicative of labyrinthine injury were seen in any of the 28 patients.
   CONCLUSIONS: Stapedectomy does not appear to increase the risk of inner ear barotrauma in scuba and sky divers. These activities may be pursued with relative safety after stapes surgery, provided adequate eustachian tube function has been established.

AB  - Purpose Post-traumatic facial nerve (FN) paralysis might need surgical decompression in selected patients. Different microscope-based surgical techniques are described in the literature such as the transmastoid, the middle cranial fossa and the translabyrinthine approach. The effectiveness of the transcanal endoscopic approach (TEA) in managing such condition has never been described and its possible indications has to be defined. Methods Retrospective multi-centric case series of patients with post-traumatic FN paralysis surgically treated with TEA. From July 2013 to July 2017, 6 patients underwent TEA for post-traumatic FN paralysis with involvement of the second genu and/or the tympanic segment of the nerve. The surgical technique is described step by step, with focus on anatomic landmarks. Post-operative outcomes are specified in terms of FN postoperative function and audiologic results. Results The TEA showed to recover a House-Brackmann grade I-II FN function in 83.2% of the patient. Post-operative air-bone gap significantly improved; whereas, the pure-tone average bone conduction did not differ significantly. Conclusions TEA represents a viable option for the treatment of post-traumatic facial palsy in patients with radiologic evidence of tympanic segment and/or perigeniculate region involvement with no involvement of the mastoid segment of the FN. Transcanal endoscopic facial nerve decompression is a safe and effective approach in highly selected cases.

TI  - Cochlear Implantation in far Advanced Otosclerosis: A Surgical, Audiological and Quality of Life Review of 35 Cases in a Single Unit
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ADVANCED OTOLOGY
LA  - English
KW  - FACIAL-NERVE STIMULATION
KW  - STAPEDECTOMY
AB  - Objective: This is a review of our experience of implanting patients with far advanced otosclerosis, specifically reviewing preoperative predictors of differences in audiological outcome, complications (including facial nerve stimulation (FNS)) and patient satisfaction.
   Materials and Methods: A retrospective case review including audiology assessments was undertaken.
   Results: Thirty-five patients were identified as having far advanced otosclerosis from the Manchester Cochlear Implant programme database. Twenty-seven patients had good outcomes (PTA threshold mean of 39dB, AB phonemes mean of 67%, BKB mean of 80%, CUNY mean of 93%). The remaining 8 had reasonable PTA thresholds but poorer audiological test scores. Analysis of these 8 cases showed that incomplete electrode insertion and electrode "switch off", to reduce FNS, are likely to have had the most effect. Six patients had FNS, all of which resolved with altered electrode mapping. Fourteen patients had implant devices with a straight, lateral wall lying electrode, and 6 (43%) of these had FNS. None of the 21 patients implanted with a perimodiolar electrode had any FNS.
   Conclusion: Results for cochlear implantation of patients with far advanced otosclerosis generally have good surgical success, good audiological outcomes and high satisfaction rates. Tinnitus is improved in most patients. The main factor leading to poorer outcome was in the use of only a limited number of electrode channels due to FNS or partial electrode insertion. Electrode design has a key role in facial nerve stimulation.

AB  - Background/Aims: To evaluate the surgical outcome of tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesterol granuloma of the middle ear in post-irradiated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: Nine post-irradiated NPC patients diagnosed with cholesterol granuloma in a single-sided middle ear were included in this study. The time from radiotherapy termination to surgery ranged from 6 to 14 years (median 9 years). All patients underwent radical tympanoplasty with canal wall down or up mastoidectomy. Results: All the patients with NPC received radiotherapy of 68-75 Gy before surgery. Three ears underwent tympanoplasty with canal wall down mastoidectomy, and 6 ears underwent tympanoplasty with canal wall up mastoidectomy. All the patients were followed up for at least 2 years. Seven ears (77.8%) had an intact tympanic membrane and 2 ears developed re-perforation of the eardrum 3 months after surgery, but otorrhea decreased significantly. All these patients reported improved quality of life after surgery. Before the operation, the pure tone averages (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 kHz) were 90.5 dB and the air-bone gaps (0.5, 1, 2 kHz) were 45.8 dB (vs. 62.3 and 25.5 dB, respectively, at 6 months after the operation). Conclusions: Most post-irradiated NPC patients with cholesterol granuloma of the middle ear benefit from this surgery. Chronic otitis media caused by radiotherapy is not a contraindication to tympanoplasty. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background We compared and analyzed the surgical results of fat myringoplasty between elderly and young adult patients with chronic otitis media. We also investigated whether underlying diseases and other factors impact the surgical outcome. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the data of 141 patients who underwent fat myringoplasty for chronic otitis media for five years. They were compared by age, sex, underlying disease, perforation size, pre- and postoperative pure tone audiometry, postoperative otorrhea, postoperative re-perforation, and cause of re-perforation. Result Postoperative re-perforation was more common in the elderly group, albeit with no significant difference (p = 0.072). The factors affecting re-perforation were insufficient fat graft (44.4%), postoperative infection (33.3%), and nasal blowing (22.2%). Our findings revealed no significant association between preoperative perforation size and re-perforation (p = 0.391). Additionally, we found no significant relationship between hypertension and re-perforation (p > 0.99), nor between age group and postoperative infection (p = 0.488). Diabetes was also not significant (p = 0.640). Following surgery, both groups exhibited a significant improvement in hearing. Conclusion Although age and underlying conditions play significant roles in the healing process, our results suggest that external factors such as infection, nasal blowing, cough, and insufficient grafted fat tissue have a similarly significant impact on surgical outcomes in elderly patients with COM as they do in adults. In conclusion, the decision to perform surgery in elderly patients with COM should be based on a comprehensive assessment of the patient's overall health status, hearing, use of hearing aids, and the indications for surgery.

AB  - Objective and intervention To compare the efficacy of the inlay, composite chondroperichondrial clip (triple-C) tympanoplasty with conventional underlay cartilage island tympanoplasty, and to evaluate its efficacy in treating large, marginal perforations. Study design The study involved 183 patients that were selected from a retrospective chart review of tympanoplasties performed at our center from March 2016 to June 2018. Setting A tertiary referral center hospital. Patients 65 patients underwent inlay, triple-C cartilage tympanoplasty (inlay group) and 118 underwent underlay cartilage island tympanoplasty (underlay group). Main outcome measures Postoperative anatomical success rate, surgical time, hearing outcomes, and complications were analyzed. Focused analysis was performed on large or marginal perforations. Results Both groups exhibited similar characteristics in demographic distribution, general health status, preoperative anatomical and hearing disabilities. Excellent results were achieved in both groups. Re-perforation occurred for 9.2% of the inlay group and 7.6% of the underlay group (p = 0.71). Hearing improvement was significant in both groups. Within the separate groups, 36% of underlay patients and 60% of inlay patients improved to achieve closure of the air-bone gap (ABG) to less than 10 dB (p = 0.1). In large or marginal perforations, both groups performed similarly. No significant complications were seen in this cohort. Nevertheless, a significant reduction in surgical time was observed in the inlay group (38 min. vs 58 min.; p = 0.0004). Conclusion Inlay triple-C tympanoplasty is comparable to conventional underlay cartilage island tympanoplasty in both anatomical and audiological success rates, even for large, marginal perforations. Due to its shorter operation time, inlay triple-C tympanoplasty should be considered a good surgical option for all tympanic membrane perforations.

AB  - Background: Although the prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is much higher in developing counties, most surgical treatment techniques are not easily accessible in many poor resource countries. Aim: The survey aims to examine the extent to which health care facilities in Nigeria are equipped to address the management challenges of CSOM. Subjects and Methods: Online questionnaires were sent and received from otolaryngologists practicing in across Nigerian public health institutions to evaluate the institutional practice concerning management of CSOM. Information enquired include: Proportion of CSOM among the ear, nose and throat (ENT) patient load, routinely applied treatments and challenges facing availability of standard treatment options. Data were analyzed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 15 (Chicago Illinois, USA), and presented descriptively. Results: Responses were returned from 17 otolaryngologists (68% [17/25]) practicing in institutions across the six geopolitical zones with a mean duration of otolaryngology services of 22.4 (14.8) years. The CSOM patients constitute an average of 25.3% (13.1) of ENT patient load, with an average of 31 (15.3) % having significant hearing loss. Surgery have never been tried in 41% (7/17) of the institutions due to lack of facilities and/or expertise. Among institutions that offer surgery, 40% (4/10) offer only cortical mastoidectomy and only 30% (3/10) offer type 1 tympanoplasty. Achievements of permanent dry ears were reported more in institutions that offer surgery. Unaffordable cost of hearing aid and lack of expertise for tympanoplasty are the major challenging factors for rehabilitation of CSOM induced hearing loss. Conclusion: Considering the enormity of CSOM in Nigeria, and the fact that > 40% (7/17) of the public health institutions still lack facilities and/or expertise for surgical treatments for CSOM, public otolaryngological centers should not only be adequately equipped for tympanomastoid surgeries, attention should be focused on further training of experts in the operative techniques from within and outside the country.

AB  - ObjectivePrimary stapes surgery is considered a challenging intervention in ear surgery. Despite an risk of deafness in 0.5-1 percent, this procedure has still a good benefit-risk ratio due to the improvement in hearing and quality of life that is usually achieved. However, revision after prior stapes surgery is considered even more challenging. Revisions after stapes surgery are very heterogeneous procedures, both in terms of the indication and the surgical strategy and are generally considered to be significantly more demanding. Reasons for complications after prior stapes surgery as well as strategies for successful revisions are not well described in the literature.MethodsRetrospective cohort study, tertiary referral center. 124 cases of revisions after prior stapes surgery were identified between 2011-2022 and are analyzed based on biographic data, clinical, audiological, and intraoperative findings as well as the eventual therapy. Cases were analyzed regarding indication, intraoperative finding and the surgical strategy chosen.ResultsAcute, subacute, and long-term complications of the primary intervention as well as other incidental reasons such as progressive hearing loss can be identified as indication for revision surgery. Preoperative clinical findings were correlated to intraoperative findings and surgical strategies. Audiological results are discussed.ConclusionsDifferent recommendations for the indication of a surgical revision can be derived depending on the individual preoperative case history and findings. In addition, there are patterns regarding the chances of success of a revision, especially in cases of persistent conductive hearing loss chances of hearing improvement seem possible in more than 80% of cases.

AB  - Introduction: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are a series of perioperative care to optimize preoperative preparation, prevent postoperative complications, minimize stress, and speedup recovery. Tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy are common surgical procedures for chronic suppurative otitis media. Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety between ERAS and conventional recovery after surgery in the perioperative period of chronic suppurative otitis media. Methods: From April 2018 to February 2019, a total of 84 patients scheduled for tympanoplasty and/or mastoidectomy due to chronic suppurative otitis media were involved and randomly divided into the ERAS group and the control group. The patients' preoperative anxiety, postoperative pain, and comfort level were determined by comparing the results of Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and General Comfort Questionnaire (GCQ). The postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, and hospitalization cost were calculated. Results: The ERAS group showed a lower SAS score (30 [28-31.5] vs 35 [30-43], P < .05], a higher GCQ score (88 [84-100] vs 83 [78.25-92.25], P < .05), and a lower VAS score (0 [0-0] vs 1 [0-2], P < .05] after surgery. No significant difference (P > .05) was observed between the ERAS group and the control group in postoperative complications, postoperative hospitalization time, and hospitalization cost, respectively. Conclusion: Enhanced recovery after surgery can reduce pain and improve comfort in the perioperative period of chronic suppurative otitis media.

AB  - Objective To provide an overview of Endoscopic Ear Surgery, its development, principles, and penetration in otology practice in 2018. Data Source PubMed review of literature and cross-sectional email survey of otologists. Methods We reviewed all PubMed published articles on use of endoscopy in practice of otology over the last 50 years. Articles were categorized based on date of publication and pattern of utilizing the endoscope. We also conducted two identical email surveys in 2010 and 2018 of otologists on the use of endoscope and tabulated and compared results. Results The number of publications on use of endoscope has increased from 6 in 1990 to an accumulated total of 451 in 2018. There has been a clear shift in the area of interest away from diagnostic endoscopy, to endoscope-assisted surgery, and lately, to transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES). Survey results further documented the increased awareness of the value of the endoscope and its increased use in clinical practice. Conclusion TEES has gained traction as a subject of research interest and in clinical practice and has lately dominated the discussion on the use of endoscope in otology. Level of Evidence NA

AB  - Higher surgical training in the UK faces a cut of two years. We conducted a questionnaire survey to assess the operative experience of current higher surgical trainees in otological surgery and the likely effect of the proposed reduction from six to four years.
   91 (65%) of the 142 higher surgical trainees responded with details of major otological procedures performed (independently or assisting) over one year. In the present six-year scheme a typical trainee performs 72 myringoplasties, 79 mastoidectomies, 7 skull base procedures and 28 other procedures. In the first four years, however, his or her experience is only 39 myringoplasties, 44 mastoidectomies, 4 skull base procedures and 7 others.
   The large shortfall in experience that might result from shortening of the training programme would need to be met by intensification of the training or institution of accredited otology fellowships. Very similar dilemmas are faced by other surgical specialties.

AB  - Introduction: chronic suppurative otitis media is a global middle ear disease with quality of life as economic implications, which are worse felt in low and middle income (LAMI) countries; thus the need for myringoplasty. This study aimed to explore audiological function in a group of adults following myringoplasty in South Africa, with an exploration of the possible influence of factors such as HIV/AIDS and type of surgical technique on hearing outcomes. Methods: within a retrospective chart review research design, 41 participant files for a six-year period from two academic hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa, were reviewed. Data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: participant files comprised of 16 males and 25 females between 18-63 years. Findings revealed that clinically, overall hearing improved post-operatively, as indicated by improved tympanometry findings, pure tone air-conduction and speech reception thresholds. Descriptively, the predictors of improved hearing outcomes post-operatively appeared to be HIV negative status and butterfly cartilage inlay surgery as a surgical technique adopted. Although clinically, hearing outcomes improved post-operatively at all air-conduction frequencies tested; these clinical improvements were only statistically significant at specific frequencies. Conclusion: current findings provide useful initial evidence on the benefits of myringoplasty from the South African context; particularly because of the HIV/AIDS prevalence and its potential influence on middle ear disease and its management. Prospective efficacy studies with bigger sample sizes are recommended, with early identification strategies for middle ear disease to reduce the need for myringoplasty seriously considered bearing in mind the resource constraints.

AB  - Objective This article is intended to investigate the impact of size and site of tympanic membrane (TM) perforation on the outcome and success rate of myringoplasty.Patients and methods This prospective study was conducted at Assiut University Hospital, between September 2015 and November 2017. Video-otoscopy was done to all cases, the images were registered on the computer and analyzed by using Universal Desktop Ruler V.3.5.3364 program, as the area of TM perforation (P) and the entire area of TM (T) were calculated. Thereafter, the percentage area of the perforation (P/Tx100%) for the perforated ear was revealed. Site of perforation was also authenticated. Preoperative and postoperative A-B gap was carried out through audiogram for hearing results.Results The overall success rate of myringoplasty was 78.8%. According to size of TM perforation; the highest success rate of myringoplasty established between small perforations was 93.3% and the lowest found between subtotal perforations was 42.9%; in medium and large perforations, the success rate of myringoplasty was 87.5 and 71.4%, respectively. As regards the site of TM perforation, the success rate of myringoplasty was highest (90%) for posterior perforations and lowest (70%) for anterior perforations; in central and inferior perforations, the success rate of myringoplasty was 79.8 and 75%, respectively. After myringoplasty, the amount of closure of A-B gap was 21.82 dB.Conclusion The size of TM perforation has a great influence on the success rate of myringoplasty, while the site of TM perforation has no impact on the success rate of myringoplasty, and myringoplasty is an effective operation for sealing off TM perforations, resulting in improvement of quality of life.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the benefits and problems of tympanoplasty in elderly patients older than 70 years.
   Study Design: Retrospective case review.
   Setting: Referral hospital otolaryngology department.
   Patients: Among 1,014 patients who underwent tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media from 2006 to 2011, those aged over 70 years were eligible for inclusion.
   Main Outcome Measures: Clinical characteristics including tympanosclerosis and preoperative severe complications were investigated. In chronic otitis media group, hearing outcomes (air-bone gap at 500-Hz and 1- and 2-kHz frequency) and postoperative ear condition were investigated. In chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, clinical characteristics including postoperative bone conduction hearing threshold (at 500-Hz and 1- and 2-kHz frequency) were investigated.
   Results: Ninety-seven ears of 83 patients were included. Eighteen ears had obvious findings of tympanosclerosis (18/97 = 18.6%). In chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma (52 ears/47 patients), no preoperative complications were noted. The mean air-bone was 30.8 and 16.1 dB before and after the operation, respectively (p < 0.001). Otorrhea disappeared in 51 ears (98.1%). In chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma (42 ears/33 patients), we noted preoperative severe complications including labyrinthine fistula (7/97 = 7.22%), widely exposed dura (1/97 = 1.03%), and facial palsy 1 (1/97 = 1.03%). The mean bone conduction hearing threshold was 39.6 dB and 40.89 dB, respectively (p = 0.7). Three ears of 3 patients had operated ears with open mastoid and underwent canal wall reconstruction tympanoplasty.
   Conclusion: Tympanoplasty in elderly patients older than 70 years seems to be as safe as when performed in younger patients.

AB  - Objective: Unstable cavities are defined as cavities with cerumen accumulation that need frequent cavity cleaning in the out-patient clinic, cavities that are intolerant to water due to risk of infection or that are subject to frequent infection and otorrhoea. The objective of this study is to address the problem of troublesome mastoid cavities, with the performance of secondary mastoid obliteration and canal wall reconstruction, using a novel posterior auricular artery (PAA) fascia-periosteum flap.
   Materials and methods: A prospective study was designed, only secondary obliterations were included. Unstable mastoid cavities were defined as Merchant grade 2 or 3 and were included for surgery.
   Results: At 12 months of follow up, a complete external auditory canal (EAC) and a self-cleaning ear were achieved in all 23 patients. Completely dry ears were achieved in 21 patients (91.3%). An air-bone gap improvement of 5 dB was achieved.
   Conclusion: Mastoid obliteration and EAC reconstruction are effective procedures to treat troublesome post canal wall down mastoid cavities. They improve quality of life and enable patients to overcome ear discharge. A standard EAC size enables the utilization of conventional hearing aids, it also reduces the need for constant mastoid cleaning and decreases healthcare expenses. The PAA flap seems to be an effective procedure to achieve all these features, as it is used to obliterate the mastoid and becomes a structural component of the neo-EAC.

We aim to demonstrate our experience with mastoid obliteration technique using bone dust and BonAlive (R) (S53P4) bioactive glass granule in a comparative prospective clinical study.
   Patients and methods: Between 1st of March 2012 and 31st of November 2021, mastoid obliteration surgery was performed in 14 patients using bone dust (7 cases) and BonAlive (R) granule (7 cases). Prior to these interventions, the patients had undergone more than three ear surgeries (CWU and CWD) generally in both groups. Changes of complaints, audiological results, and changes in quality of life were analysed in both groups, postoperatively.
   Results: Having performed the mastoid obliteration technique, cochlear damage did not occur in either patient group. Long-term ear discharge and vertigo were occasionally observed after performing obliteration with bone dust. However, these complaints disappeared after a while. Complications were not reported in the case of obliteration with BonAlive (R). Outstanding improvement was experienced in both groups.
   Conclusion: In our practice, mastoid obliteration surgery, using either bone dust or BonAlive (R) granule, has proved to be a safe and effective method in the management of chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma, resulting in continuous putrid ear discharge after CWT or CWD tympanoplasty. Obliteration with BonAlive (R) granule provides several advantages for patients, such as antibacterial effect, osteoconductive effect ensuring frame for bone growth and osteoproductive effect stimulating the ossification.

AB  - Objectives: To test the hypothesis that surgical otologic intervention for any type of adult hearing loss decreases the odds for incident adverse life events (ALEs) and medical comorbidities (MCBs). Study Design: Retrospective cohort database study. Methods: Electronic medical record data from the TriNetX Research Network were queried for adults (age >= 18 years) with congenital, sensorineural, conductive, and mixed hearing loss (HL). Patients were further stratified into 3 groups by presence or absence (HL-surgery) of surgical intervention at any point following diagnosis, including (1) stapes surgery (HL + stapes); (2) cochlear implantation and bone-anchored hearing aid (HL + CI); and (3) mastoidectomy alone and tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy (HL + TM). Primary outcomes were defined as odds for new ALEs or MCBs at any point given HL treatment status [Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval, (OR; 95% CI, P-value)]. Cohorts were balanced using propensity-score matching (PSM) based on US census-defined demographics and congenital comorbidities. Results: There were 2 577 153 patients included in this study. Matched analysis demonstrated that HL + stapes adults (n = 7985) had 0.37-lower odds (95% CI = 0.30-0.47, P < .0001) of experiencing any incident ALE versus HL-surgery adults (n = 2 518 409). Adults in the HL + CI cohort (n = 17 129) had 0.58-lower odds (0.52-0.66, P < .0001) of experiencing any incident MCB versus HL-surgery adults. Conclusions: This study highlights the benefit of surgical intervention for adult hearing loss on social and medical phenomes. These findings represent the largest cohort study to date demonstrating this association and further support that hearing restoration improves patient socioeconomic and medical outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Patients with Turner syndrome (TS) have craniofacial malformations, such as Eustachian tube hypoplasia and dysfunction and velar dysfunction, which foster acute otitis media. The aim of this study was to inventory pediatric otologic disorders in patients with TS at their first ENT consultation in our center.
   Patients and methods: We reviewed the ENT consultation data of pediatric TS patients followed in our center between 2005 and 2015: otoscopy, hearing threshold, and history of acute otitis media or ENT surgery. Data were compared according to karyotype: X monosomy (45,X), mosaic (45,X/46,XX), isochromosome (46,Xi [Xq]), X ring chromosome X (XrX), with Y material, and "other".
   Results: Ninety patients, with mean age 11.9 years (+/- 4.8 years) at first ENT consultation, were included: 29% showed tympanic abnormality on otoscopy, 21% had hearing loss, 24% had history of recurrent acute otitis media; 18% had undergone adenoidectomy, 24% T-tube insertion, and 5.6% tympanoplasty. No particular karyotype was associated with higher risk of hearing loss or acute otitis media.
   Conclusion: Patients with TS showed high prevalence of pediatric otologic disorders; they therefore require close and prolonged ENT follow-up. (C) 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective There is concern that current otolaryngology residents may not receive adequate surgical training. We aimed to characterize residents' surgical experiences at 5 academic centers performing the 14 key indicator procedures (KIPs) outlined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. Study Design Prospective study. Setting Five otolaryngology training programs. Methods Data were gathered from December 2019 to December 2020 with a smartphone application from the Society for Improving Medical Professional Learning. After each operation, residents and faculty rated trainee autonomy on a 4-level Zwisch scale and performance on a 5-level modified Dreyfus scale. Results Residents and attendings (n = 92 and 78, respectively) logged 2984 evaluations. Attending ratings of resident autonomy and performance increased with training level (P < .001). Resident self-assessments of autonomy and performance were lower than paired attending assessments (P < .001). Among attending evaluations of KIPs performed by senior residents (postgraduate year 4 or 5), 55% of cases were performed with meaningful autonomy (passive help or supervision only). Similarly, attendings rated 55% of these cases as a practice-ready or exceptional performance. Senior residents had meaningful autonomy for >= 50% of cases for most KIPs, with the exception of flaps and grafts (40%), pediatric/adult airway (39%), and stapedectomy/ossiculoplasty (33%). Similarly, senior residents received practice-ready or exceptional performance ratings for >= 50% of cases across all KIPs other than pediatric/adult airway (42%) and stapedectomy/ossiculoplasty (33%). Conclusion In this multicenter study, resident surgical autonomy and performance varied across otolaryngology KIPs. The development of nationwide benchmarks will help programs and residents set educational goals.

AB  - ObjectiveChronic suppurative otitis media is a major global disease disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries, but few studies have explored access to care for those with ear and hearing disorders. MethodIn a tertiary hospital in Cambodia providing specialist ear services, a mixed method study was undertaken. This study had three arms: (1) quantitative analysis of patients undergoing ear surgery, (2) a questionnaire survey and (3) semi-structured in-depth interviews. ResultsPatients presented with advanced middle-ear disease and associated hearing loss at rates that are amongst the highest per capita levels globally. Patients reported several structural, financial and socio-cultural barriers to treatment. This study showed a significant burden of ear disease in Cambodia, which reflects a delay in receiving timely and effective treatment. ConclusionThis study highlights the opportunity to integrate effective ear and hearing care into primary care service provision, strengthening the package of activities delivered at government facilities.

AB  - Introduction: Many scientists have worked on microbial flora of the ear canal or middle ear in nonoperated patients, but it is not clear that what changes would be occurred in the flora of the mastoid cavity postoperatively. It can help the surgeons to choose the appropriate drugs in the perioperative period. The study was designed to investigate the microbial flora of the middle ear and mastoid cavities after canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy. Materials and Methods: The survey was designed as a prospective cross-sectional study. All patients with chronic otitis media who had undergone CWD mastoidectomy in a public university hospital from 2014 to 2017 were enrolled in the study. They were periodically followed up postoperatively at least for 6 months. Swab sampling from ear cavity was performed, and the samples were sent for culture and antibiogram. Each specimen was sent for bacterial and fungal analysis. If bacterial culture result was positive, the sensitivity of the cultured organisms to common antibiotics was also assessed. Results: Seventy-four patients entered into the survey. Twenty-six (35%) of samples were positive for bacteria, and 11 (14.5%) were positive for fungi. Furthermore, 3 (4%) of the studied ears were positive simultaneously for both bacterial and fungal culture. Among cultured bacteria, Staphylococcus epidermidis was the most common species (29%). Candida species was the most common fungal species (8%). Conclusions: Microbial infection is a common finding after CWD mastoidectomy. S. epidermidis and Candida species should be considered as the primary targets of treatment.

AB  - BackgroundIn the course of restoration of the middle ear, routine histological examinations are initiated in many cases, although amiddle ear cholesteatoma can be clinically diagnosed in anormal case.Aim of the studyTo determine the correlation between the surgeons' diagnosis and that of the pathologist and comparison with literature data. To check the rate of unexpected diagnoses. Analysis of the costs and survey of German ENT clinics with regard to handling of the histological examination in suspected cholesteatoma.Materials and methodsRetrospective evaluation of cholesteatoma cases of the ENT Department of the University Medical Center of Mainz from 2010-2015. Germany-wide postal survey of ENT clinics.ResultsIn all, 449 operations for the rehabilitation of amiddle ear cholesteatoma, of which there were 312 (69.5%) first diagnoses and 137 (30.5%) recurrences. Ahistological examination was conducted in 78.6%. For first diagnoses, the sensitivity of the clinical assessment was 97.9%, specificity 10%, positive predictive value 96.3%, and negative predictive value 16.7%. Recurrences showed values of 100%, 40%, 97.1% and 100%. Unexpected malignant findings did not occur. This routine histological examination was performed by 58.6% of German ENT hospitals. Atotal of 80% of those questioned this to be useful. Ahistological examination cost an average of 14.06Euro.ConclusionIntraoperatively, there is ahigh degree of accuracy in diagnosing cholesteatoma. The cost factor of the histological examination is low and should not be the basis for the decision. The ear microscopy and the experience of the ear surgeon should be decisive for the decision for histological examination.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate hearing outcomes after stapes surgery in children with stapes fixation. Study Design: Retrospective study. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: Forty-nine patients (66 ears) aged less than 15 years who received stapes surgery. Interventions: Stapes surgery. Main Outcomes and Measures: Preoperative symptoms, bilateral involvement, pure-tone hearing levels, and perioperative complications were analyzed using paired t test and Mann-Whitney U test. Results: The chief complaint of all patients was hearing disturbance. Sixteen ears were diagnosed with stapes fixation and an additional congenital ossicular anomaly and 50 ears had only stapes fixation. Preoperative mean bone conduction and air conduction thresholds were 12.0 +/- 5.8 dB and 60.9 +/- 10.9 dB, respectively. The mean air-bone gap (ABG) was 48.9 +/- 12.0 dB in patients with stapes fixation and an ossicular anomaly. The postoperative mean ABG was 23.6 +/- 14.5 dB, and the ABG closure was 25.3 +/- 18.2 dB. In patients with stapes fixation only, the preoperative mean bone conduction and air conduction thresholds were 14.3 +/- 7.5 dB and 49.6 +/- 9.5 dB, respectively, and the mean ABG was 35.5 +/- 9.6 dB. The postoperative mean ABG was 14.4 +/- 10.3 dB, and the ABG closure was 16.2 +/- 16.1 dB. The successful results (ABG <20 dB) were 75.8% overall, 56.3% for fixation and an ossicular anomaly, and 82.0% for fixation only. Conclusions: In children with stapes fixation, hearing loss was worse when the fixation was combined with an ossicular anomaly. Ossicular continuity, especially of the incus, is the most important factor for successful stapes surgery. Appropriate diagnosis and surgical intervention can lead to good results for children with stapes fixation.

AB  - Introduction: Tympanic membrane perforations might have a negative impact on the patient's quality of life, especially in the pediatric population. Surgery is therefore often required. The most adequate age for surgery remains unclear and is debated in the current literature. The aim of this study was to investigate outcomes of type I tympanoplasty in children and examine the impact of age on surgical outcome.
   Methods: Retrospective cohort study. All patients under the age of 18 undergoing type I tympanoplasty at Regional Hospital West Jutland, Denmark, from 1/1-2013 to 31/12-2017 had their medical files reviewed. The primary endpoint of interest was tympanic membrane closure rate six months following surgery, i.e. surgical success. Secondary outcomes were air-bone-gap reduction and the correlation between age and surgical success. Results: A total of 180 patients undergoing 197 procedures met the predefined criteria. Age at the time of surgery ranged between five and 17 years. Mean age at the time of surgery was 10.1 years (95% CI 9.1-11.2). Surgical success was achieved in 91,3% of the cases. No correlation between age and surgical success was found. Mean air-bone gap was reduced from 19.8 dB (95% CI 18.5-21.0) preoperatively, to 6.9 dB (95% CI 6.1-7.7) at followup, p < 0.05. Air-bone gaps <= 10 dB at follow-up were achieved in 155 of the cases (78.6%). Postoperative infection seemed to increase the risk of surgical failure, RR 2.80 ((95% CI 1.06-7.38), p 1/4 0.037).
   Conclusions: Type 1 tympanoplasty in children is an effective treatment in terms of achieving an intact tympanic membrane and improved hearing. No correlation could be found between age and surgical success. Postoperative infection influences surgical outcome negatively.

AB  - Objectives: Determine whether the outcome of tympanoplasty in preschool children is different from that of older children.
   Study design: Retrospective case series.
   Methods: Retrospective review of children having undergone a primary tympanoplasty by 4 surgeons for a tympanic membrane perforation between 2002 and 2013.
   Results: Data from 50 children age 2-4, 130 children age 5-7 and 105 children age 8-13 years old were reviewed. Median follow-up was 7.5 months. On crude analysis, the incidence of anatomical success was not significantly different between the different age groups (p = 0.38), the success rate was respectively 69.4%, 68.5% and 79.1% with an overall rate of 72.5%. 5.9% of all children required later insertion of tympanostomy tubes, 10.2% in preschool children. The post-operative audiology results were similar for all groups with a mean improvement of 9 dB in the air-bone gap. When limiting the analysis to the 155 children having at least 6 months of follow-up, the rate of success was respectively 50.0%, 60.8% and 74.0% (p = 0.10). After multivariate analysis controlling for the effect of surgeon, approach and etiology, the odds ratio of perforation was respectively 5.48, 2.27 and 1.00 for the different age groups.
   Conclusion: Children younger than 4 years of age have the worst outcome after tympanoplasty. It remains uncertain whether the benefits of hearing improvement and quality of life may outweigh that of a high rate of a residual, usually smaller, perforation. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results and delineate the patient characteristics and technique most likely to lead to successful results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background and objectives: This prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was designed to compare the effects of desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane when combined with remifentanil for induced hypotension on surgical conditions and operative field during tympanoplasty.
   Methods: Sixty patients undergoing tympanoplasty were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized into three groups of 20 each to receive the inhalation anaesthetics desflurane, isoflurane or sevoflurane. Propofol 2 mg kg(-1) was administered for induction of anaesthesia in all groups. All patients received a continuous infusion of remifentanil which was titrated between 0.2 and 0.5 mug kg(-1) min(-1) to achieve a mean blood pressure (BP) of 60-70 mmHg. Nitroglycerine was infused if this BP could not be achieved. Arterial pressures were recorded continuously throughout the operation. Surgical conditions were assessed every 20 min by the blinded surgeon using a six-point category scale (0-5).
   Results: One patient in the desflurane group and two patients in isoflurane group required nitroglycerine to maintain desired mean BR Sustained controlled hypotension was sufficient in all of the groups throughout surgery. Category scale scores were less than or equal to3 throughout the study, except one patient in the sevoflurane group who had a score of 4 at the 60th minute of the operation. No difference was found among groups when haemodynamic parameters and surgical category scale scores were compared. There were no postoperative respiratory and circulatory complications.
   Conclusion: Desflurane, sevoflurane or isoflurane combined with remifentanil provided adequate induced hypotension and similar operating conditions and any of them could be safely and equally used in anaesthesia for tympanoplasty.

AB  - Background: We hypothesize that dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective alpha(2) adrenergic receptor agonist, may affect the intraoperative blood loss and clotting tests such as prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and international normalized ratio in children undergoing adenotonsillectomy (ADT).
   Methods: Sixty patients scheduled for elective ADT under general anesthesia. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either DEX 0.5 mu g/kg (group D) or placebo bolus (group C) with a total volume of 10 mL, 10 min before the induction of anesthesia. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate, blood loss, preoperatively and immediately after awakening clotting tests, agitation, sedation, visual analog scale, and analgesic requirement, were assessed and recorded.
   Results: The postoperative hemoglobin was significantly lower than the preoperative value in both groups (P < 0.05). The postoperative agitation scale and analgesic requirement and visual analog scale at the 15th min were significantly lower in group D than those in group C (P < 0.05). Total blood loss and postoperative sedation score in group D was significantly higher than that in group C (P < 0.05). The postoperative prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio tests between the groups, additionally pre-postoperative MAP, heart rate, and clotting tests were similar in each group.
   Conclusions: The premedication with DEX 0.5 mu g/kg decreased postoperative agitation, pain, and analgesic requirement without significant change in the clotting tests and MAP but increased bleeding slightly during ADT. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate how much patients remember of the risks discussed with them about their otologic surgery and to evaluate whether a simple intervention, the addition of an information handout, improves recall.
   Study Design: A prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in the setting of an academic tertiary care centre.
   Methods: Fifty patients undergoing a variety of otologic procedures, including mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, ossiculoplasty, and stapedectomy, were verbally consented by the operating surgeon with a standard checklist of potential surgical complications and side effects. Two surgeons participated in the study (40 patients and 10 patients). Patients were stratified into two groups: a higher education group and a lower education group. Within each group, patients were randomized to either a control group, consisting of a verbal explanation only, or an intervention group, which added a written handout to the verbal explanation. A follow-up telephone interview was conducted at an average of 20.6 days (range 14-53) to survey for recall of the complications discussed.
   Main Outcome Measures: The main outcome measure is risk recall. This is analyzed by education level and written sheet intervention. Other parameters examined are patient demographics, time elapsed from when the consent was obtained, and surgeon obtaining the consent.
   Results: All 50 patients were interviewed in follow-up. Twenty-two patients received the handout (intervention arm), and 28 patients served as the control group. Overall recall, expressed as a percentage of risks explained, was 54% for the entire study group. For those who received the handout, the recall rate was 51%, whereas the rate was actually higher, at 56%, for those who did not receive the handout. This difference was not statistically significant. Of the specific risks discussed, patient recall was consistently high for the complications of facial nerve paralysis, 88%, and for complete hearing loss, at 88%. Other risks, such as dizziness, 31%, and change in taste, 36%, were not as commonly recalled. Receiving the handout made only a significant difference with one complication, facial nerve paralysis.
   Conclusion: The addition of a handout did not significantly alter recall of potential complications of otologic surgery with the exception of facial nerve paralysis.

AB  - Stapes fracture causes hearing loss and instability in the middle ear hearing system (MEHS). The material used in the stapes reconstruction restores stapes, but the effects of the nonlinear material parameters on the stability of the MEHS are still unknown. To address this challenge, the nonlinear dynamic response and stability of the stapes reconstruction are investigated using a multi-degree-of-freedom mechanical model. The material parameters of the implant are tentatively determined by analyzing the natural frequencies of the undamped system. The dynamical properties of the MEHS are characterized under different external excitations. The approximate solution of the MEHS near the resonant frequency is derived through the multiple-time-scale method (MTSM). The results show that the nonlinear stiffness of the material has little influence on the MEHS in the healthy state, but it causes resonant phenomena between the ossicle and the implant in the pathological state.

AB  - ObjectivesTo compare postoperative tympanoplasty outcomes between active versus inactive otitis media (OM) patients with tympanic membrane perforation.Databases ReviewedMedline via PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Google Scholar for studies published from inception to March 1, 2023.MethodsStudies of 15- to 60-year-old patients undergoing microscopic/endoscopic myringoplasty using underlay/overlay technique with reported postoperative mean hearing gain and graft uptake were included. Studies requiring simultaneous surgical procedures, reporting patients with comorbidities and with non-English full text articles were excluded. Articles were independently screened by two researchers with data extracted according to a predetermined proforma in Microsoft Excel. Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment was used for risk of bias evaluation of randomized studies and Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions for nonrandomized studies. Similar studies were pooled for meta-analysis using the inverse variance random effects model to calculate the mean difference and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) for mean hearing gain and DerSimonian and Laird random effects model for graft uptake.ResultsThirty-three studies comprising 2,373 patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria, seven were pooled for meta-analysis. Included articles showed inactive OM patients have higher average postoperative mean hearing gain of 10.84 dB and graft uptake of 88.7% compared to active OM patients (9.15 dB and 84.2%). Meta-analysis of mean hearing gain (MD, -0.76 dB; 95% CI, -2.11 to 0.60; p = 0.27, moderate certainty) and graft uptake (OD, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.34-1.09; p = 0.10, moderate certainty) have an overall p value >0.05.ConclusionThere were no statistically significant differences in postoperative mean hearing gain and graft uptake between active and inactive OM patients undergoing tympanoplasty. Hence, tympanoplasty procedures should not be postponed solely because of patients' preoperative ear discharge status.

AB  - ObjectiveSize, an important characteristic of a tympanic membrane perforation (TMP), is commonly assessed with gross estimation via visual inspection, a practice which is prone to inaccuracy. Herein, we demonstrate feasibility of a proof-of-concept computer vision model for estimating TMP size in a small set of perforations.MethodsAn open-source deep learning architecture was used to train a model to segment and calculate the area of a perforation and the visualized tympanic membrane (TM) in a set of endoscopic images of mostly anterior and relatively small TMPs. The model then computed relative TMP size by calculating the ratio of perforation area to TM area. Model performance on the test dataset was compared to ground-truth manual annotations. In a validation survey, otolaryngologists were tasked with estimating the size of TMPs from the test dataset. The primary outcome was the average absolute error of model size predictions and clinician estimates compared to sizes determined by ground-truth manual annotations.ResultsThe model's average absolute error for size predictions was a 0.8% overestimation for all test perforations. Conversely, among the 38 survey respondents, the average clinician error was a 11.0% overestimation (95% CI, 5.2-16.7%, p = 0.003).ConclusionsIn a small sample of TMPs, we demonstrated a computer vision approach for estimating TMP size is feasible. Further validation studies must be done with significantly larger and more heterogenous datasets.Level of EvidenceN/A Laryngoscope, 2024
   Though size is central characteristic of tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs), its assessment is often subjective and inaccurate. A computer vision approach for identification and measurement of TMPs was developed and shown to be more accurate than sampled otolaryngologists at estimating TMP size in small subset of mostly dry, anterior and small perforations.image

AB  - Objective: Alpha-2 adrenoceptors have recently been used perioperatively for their sedative, analgesic, sympatholytic and cardiovascular stabilizing effects. The efficacy of clonidine as an adjuvant in providing monitored anesthesia care (MAC) for ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeries has not been much investigated, so we conducted this study.
   Methodology: In this prospective double blind randomized placebo controlled study, 90 patients posted for elective ENT surgeries under local anesthesia with MAC were included and divided into 3 groups of 30 each. In Group C-BI patients received clonidine 3 mu g/kg intravenous bolus followed by clonidine infusion at 0.3 mu g/kg/hr. Patients of Group C-B received clonidine 3 mu g/kg bolus followed by placebo infusion and in Group P patients received placebo bolus followed by placebo infusion. All three Groups received similar premedication of intravenous midazolam 0.03 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 mu g/kg. Demographic data, intraoperative vital parameters, observer's assessment and alertness scale (OAAS) score for sedation, bleeding score, patient and surgeon satisfaction score, postoperative Aldrete score, visual analogue scale (VAS) score for analgesia, rescue sedative and analgesic consumption and complications were noted.
   Results: OAAS score (0-noresponse to 5-awake), 10 min after infusion of study drug was significantly lower in Groups C-BI (2.06 +/- 0.61) and C-B (2.83 +/- 0.70) signifying superior sedation as compared to placebo Group (4.80 +/- 0.40), (p=0.000). Intraoperative rescue sedative and analgesic consumption were significantly lower in Groups C-BI and C-B, as compared to placebo group (p = 0.000). Mean heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were significantly lower in Groups C-BI and C-B as compared to Group P (p = 0.000). Intraoperative bleeding score (0-Nolbleeding to 4-modearte bleeding) was significantly lower in Group C-BI (0.86 +/- 0.68) and C-B (1.36 +/- 0.76) as compared to placebo (3.10 +/- 0.54), p = 0.000. Surgeons and patients were more satisfied in clonidine Groups C-BI and C-B, (p = 0.000). Patients of Group C-BI demonstrated better sedation profile, less bleeding score and higher satisfaction scores as compared to Group C-B (p<0.05).
   Conclusion: Being a safe, well tolerated, cheap and effective regime, our study favors the use of clonidine 3 mu g/kg IV bolus followed by infusion of 0.3 mu g/kg/hr as an adjunct to conventional MAC regime of midazolam and fentanyl in ENT surgeries as it provides effective sedation and bloodless surgical field.

AB  - Introduction: In order to treat the symptoms of otosclerosis, various surgical and medical treatments are suggested. Surgical treatments are the choice. This study aimed to determine the incidence of vertigo and its cause in Iran, and the present study focused on this issue.
   Methods: This was a prospective cohort study carried out on patients with otosclerosis undergoing stapedotomy referred to Rasoul Akram hospital, Tehran during 2017-18. The patients aged below 18 or those who had a history of vertigo were excluded. Diapasonic and audiometric tests were carried out. The follow-ups included the time of admission (the day after surgery) for the presence of vertigo using visual analogue scale and diapasonic tests, one week after surgery using visual analogue scale and diapasonic tests, and one month after surgery using visual analogue scale and audiometry. The data were imported to SPSS v.22 software and analyzed.
   Results: The surgical complications that occurred after stapedotomy for patients in this center were as follows: 12.1% of subjects had vertigo one day after surgery, 8.6% had vertigo one week later, and 1.7% had vertigo one month later, thus, the frequency of vertigo was reduced overtime. Meanwhile, 91.4% of the patients had a better sense of hearing and only 1.7% suffered from tympanic membrane perforation. In 8.6% of subjects, there was a disturbance in the taste. Tinnitus was only observed in 5.2% of the surgical patients in this center. Among women, vertigo was higher one day and one week after surgery. Logistic regression showed that age is significant predictor of dizziness one day after surgery (OR: 1.37, P=0.03).
   Conclusion: According to the results, the frequency of vertigo was decreased overtime. In this study, it was found that the complications of stapedotomy surgery were less than other surgical methods, but those who were older had significantly higher vertigo a week and one day after surgery indicating effective role of age on postoperative complications. Those who underwent surgery by tympanomeatal method had a better vertigo one day and one week after surgery.

AB  - Objective To evaluate speech outcomes and facial nerve stimulation (FNS) rates in patients with far advanced otosclerosis (FAO) after cochlear implantation. Methods A systematic review was performed using standardized methodology of Medline, EMBASE, PubMed, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Studies were included if adults with FAO underwent cochlear implantation. Exclusion criteria included concurrent otologic history (e.g., Meniere's disease, superior canal dehiscence), non-English-speaking implant users, case reports, abstracts, and letters/commentaries. Bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies and the National Institute of Health Scale for case series. The primary outcome measure was speech discrimination and the secondary outcomes were rates of partial insertion and FNS. Results Twenty-seven studies evaluated cochlear implantation in FAO. Due to the heterogeneity of testing methods, statistical pooling of speech discrimination was not feasible, but qualitative synthesis indicated a positive effect of implantation. Pooled rates of FNS were 18% (95% confidence interval, CI 12%-27%) and the rate of partial insertion was 10% (95% CI 7%-15%). Conclusion Cochlear implantation in FAO demonstrates significant gains in speech discrimination scores with higher rates of FNS and partial insertion. Laryngoscope, 2022

AB  - Objective: To evaluate whether the performance of stapes surgery by residents during residency has decreased during the last 40 years, and if so, whether such a decrease has impacted the number of general otolaryngologists performing stapedectomy in the private practice setting.
   Study Design: Survey questionnaire of members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.
   Methods: A short questionnaire was mailed to 1,700 members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Data collected included age, year of residency graduation, fellowship (if any), practice setting, geographic location, number of stapedectornies performed in residency, and number of stapedectornies performed currently.
   Results: Seven hundred fifty-six (44%) of 1,700 surveys were returned; 558 (74%) of 756 respondents did not complete a fellowship and were included in the general otolaryngologist group. Overall, 41% of general otolaryngologists are performing stapes surgery. There was a significant decline in the number of resident stapedectomies performed between 1960 and 1986; since 1986, this number has plateaued to an average of 8 to 9 (self-reported) cases per resident. More recent graduation from residency trended toward decreased inclination to do stapedectomy, although the result was not statistically significant. Increasing number of stapedectomy cases performed in residency correlated with an increased likelihood of performing the operation in practice.
   Conclusion: Despite a decreasing case volume of stapes surgery in residency, stapedectomy remains an operation performed by general otolaryngologists.

AB  - Seven different types of widely used metallic stapedectomy prostheses were individually placed on a millimeter scale in a plastic Petri dish. The Petri dish was moved within the core and around the magnet of a 1.5-tesla magnetic resonance imaging unit (General Electric Sigma). No movement of any of the prostheses was seen. We conclude that there is no apparent danger of these prostheses becoming displaced in stapedectomy patients subjected to the electromagnetic fields of magnetic resonance  imaging units.

AB  - Objectives: Hypotensive anesthesia is necessary during endoscopic sinus surgery to achieve a bloodless surgical field. The aim of this study was to compare the quality of surgical field using propofol or desflurane anesthesia.
   Methodology: 40 patients of either sex, belonging to ASA physical status I and II, and age group of 18-60 years were randomized into two groups to receive either propofol and morphine or desflurane and morphine anesthesia. The target mean arterial pressure (MAP) was kept in a range of 65-75 mmHg. The quality of surgical field was assessed by using a validated scoring system (Fromme category scale) at every 15 min by the same surgeon in all the cases to avoid surgeon's bias.
   Results: The mean category scale value was 2.665 +/- 0.243 in propofol group and 2.200 +/- 0.410 in desflurane group (p=0.000). The time to emergence was significantly less in desflurane group (9.35 +/- 1.27) as compared to propofol group (14.60 +/- 2.06 min).
   Conclusion: We conclude that both the propofol and desflurane can be used to achieve a satisfactory surgical field quality but desflurane provides a rapid emergence as compared to propofol.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Surgery and hearing aids have similar outcomes in terms of hearing acuity but differ in terms of cost, aesthetics, and patient quality of life. The cost-effectiveness and budget impact of otosclerosis treatments have never been studied in Europe.
   OBJECTIVES To compare the estimated mean costs per patient over 10 years of surgery vs hearing aids for the treatment of otosclerosis and to estimate the budget impact of an increase in the proportion of patients receiving surgical treatment.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This economic evaluation analyzed French and European epidemiological data on the surgical management of symptomatic otosclerosis and compared them with data from the literature to build economic models. The analysis was conducted in January 2021.
   EXPOSURES Two care pathways were considered in the treatment of otosclerosis, either hearing aid or surgery.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Costs were studied over 10 years using Markov models of the 2 care pathways (hearing aid vs surgery). The budget impact analysis was performed over 5 and 10 years, assuming a 1-percentage point yearly increase in the proportion of patients receiving surgical treatment.
   RESULTS Over 10 years, the estimated mean cost per patient was significantly lower in the surgery group compared with the hearing aid group ((sic)3446.9 vs (sic)6088.4; mean difference, -(sic)2641.5; 95% CI -(sic)4064.8 to -(sic)1379.4 [US $3913.4 vs US $6912.4; mean difference, -US $2999.0; 95% CI, -US $4614.9 to -US $1566.1)). Increasing surgical treatment by 1 percentage point per year for 10 years would lead to overall savings of (sic)1762304 (US $2 000 798) in France, with an increase of (sic)1322 920 (US $1501952) at 10 years for the public health insurance system and a decrease of (sic)3 085 224 (US $3 502750) at 10 years for patients and private health insurers. Sensitivity analyses showed that these results were robust.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest that in France, treating otosclerosis surgically is slightly less expensive over 10 years than using hearing aids, when considering all payers. The proposed models developed in this study could be adjusted to perform the same analysis in other countries.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A lesser known after effect of harvesting temporalis fascia is the post-surgical craniofacial pain.The aim of the study was to evaluate this pain after tympanomastoid surgeries and the effectiveness of silastic sheet interpositioning to prevent this pain.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: This pilot study that spanned one year, included patients who underwent tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy involving the harvesting of temporalis fascia. At the end of surgery, the wound was closed after silastic sheet was secured over the donor site in cases and without silastic sheet in controls. In the post-operative period, patients scored their temporal pain, tenderness and pain during opening of mouth and mastication on a visual analogue scale (VAS) on day 7, 15, 30 and 90.
   RESULTS: Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the silastic group were lower than the control group on day 7 and 15 after surgery and the difference was statistically significant. In the control group, temporal pain and tenderness were 74% and 81% respectively on day 7.VAS scores of both groups decreased over time and were negligible after 3 months. There were no significant postoperative complications in either group and no reaction or rejection of silastic sheet in the cases.
   CONCLUSION: Post-surgical craniofacial pain secondary to the harvesting of temporalis fascia is observed in a majority of the patients. This novel technique involving silastic sheet interposition can decimate early post-operative temporal pain, tenderness and masticatory pain.

AB  - Objective: To describe the rehabilitation of canal wall down mastoidectomy cavities using a custom-made titanium wall implant and to analyze the benefits and the long-term functional results.
   Study Design: Retrospective analysis.
   Setting: Tertiary care center.
   Patients and Methods: We have reviewed the data of 113 consecutive operated ears from 106 patients during a 9-year period (1993-2002). The following preoperative and postoperative criteria were compared: the persistence or resolution of otorrhea, cholesteatoma, and vertigo; external auditory canal healing, position of the titanium prosthesis, and tympanic membrane findings. In addition, the hearing status was evaluated by comparing the preoperative data with the 6-month and last follow-up postoperative data to deduce the air-bone gap (ABG) and the auditory gains.
   Results: Operated ears (88.5%) were dry after the initial rehabilitation, and 97.3% were dry after a revision surgery for defective canal healing. Most patients (96.5%) were free of vertigo. The external auditory canal wall was in a good position in all cases and allowed for a primary skin healing process in 84% of cases; the remaining patients underwent revision surgery under local anesthesia to complete the healing. The reconstructed drum was stable and anatomic in 73% of the cases (n = 83) after the first surgery. Thirty-six patients (32%) underwent various revision procedures: aeration tube placement for 16 patients with mesotympanic retraction and/or serous effusion, revision surgery for 12 patients with attic retraction or evidence of cholesteatoma, and revision for 5 patients with perforation. At last follow-up, 100% of the ear canals were healed, and 85% of patients had a normal tympanic membrane. No residual cholesteatoma was found at last follow-up. Thirty-six percent of patients had an ABG within 20 dB at last follow-up, and 69% within 30 dB.
   Conclusion: The rehabilitation of canal wall down mastoidectomies improves the quality of life of patients regarding cholesteatoma recurrence, otorrhea, and vertigo in more than 95% of cases and stabilizes the hearing loss to less than 30 dB of ABG for more than two thirds of patients. The main unresolved problem is the persistent dysfunction of the middle ear cavity, with unsatisfactory auditory improvements. Middle ear implants represent in selected cases a new solution to rehabilitate the refractory hearing losses.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the possible clinical relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease and the type one tympanoplasty surgical outcomes of adults with chronic otitis media, by using a simple, cost-effective, reliable questionnaire and physical findings.
   Methods: Fifty-two of 147 patients undergoing type one tympanoplasty were studied. Gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms were evaluated using the Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease questionnaire. Laryngoscopic physical findings of laryngopharyngeal reflux were evaluated using the Reflux Finding Score. A successful outcome was defined as an intact tympanic membrane. Correlations between the two assessment tool results and the patient's surgical success were calculated.
   Results: The gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire score was significantly higher in patients with unsuccessful tympanic membrane closure (group one) than in patients with successful closure (group two) (p < 0.05). The Reflux Finding Score was also significantly higher in group one than group two (p < 0.05). There was a significant positive relationship between the gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire score and the Reflux Finding Score (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Gastroesophageal reflux disease may be a significant prognostic factor for tympanoplasty failure. Therefore, reflux investigation may be important during the treatment of chronic otitis media, and positive cases may need reflux treatment as well as ear disease treatment.

AB  - Objective: To determine the incidence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) following stapedectomy in a patient group and the efficacy of the Epley maneuver in this group. Study Design: Prospective study in a university-based tertiary referral system, Methods: The patient group comprised 63 patients who had undergone stapedectomy; a control group consisted of normal healthy individuals with no otolaryngological complaints. Ah individuals underwent the Dix-Hallpike maneuver for the diagnosis of BPPV, Patients who exhibited vertigo, torsional nystagmus (which reverses its direction on return to sitting position) preceded by a latent period, and the fatigability of these findings were considered to have BPPV, If the test result was positive, they underwent the Epley therapeutic maneuver. Results: Four of the patients who had undergone a stapedectomy showed characteristic findings of BPPV, No individual in the control group had BPPV, Ah patients responded well to the Epley maneuver. Conclusions: Stapedectomy may be regarded as an etiological factor in BPPV. Because the fenestra is located in the posterior part of the stapes footplate, the pathophysiology appears to be related to utricular rather than saccular trauma. Correct measurement of the distance between the incus and stapes footplate is essential in stapedectomy, An Internet survey of the relevant literature in English shows a scarcity of publications on the incidence of BPPV following stapedectomy, In the present study, 63 patients who had undergone a stapedectomy were investigated for the presence of BPPV; all had Dix-Hallpike maneuvers performed for the diagnosis, Sixty-three individuals with no otolaryngological complaints made up the control group. Four of the patients who had undergone stapedectomy showed characteristic findings of BPPV, and no individual in the control group had BPPV; the difference between the two groups was statistically significant. Ah four of the patients diagnosed with BPPV responded well to the Epley maneuver, The pathophysiology appears to be related to utricular trauma. Correct measurement of the distance between the incus and stapes footplate is essential in stapedectomy.

AB  - Background. Ear, nose, and throat (ENT) diseases are an oft overlooked global health concern. Despite their high prevalence and associated morbidity and mortality, ENT diseases have remained neglected in health care delivery. In Zambia and many other low-income countries, ENT services are characterized by poor funding, unavailable surgical procedures, and erratic supply of essential drugs. Objective. To investigate ENT service provision in Zambia with regard to availability of surgical procedures and supply of essential drugs. Methods. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted using a piloted structured questionnaire between 17 January 2017 and 2 January 2018. Included in the study were the 109 hospitals registered with the Ministry of Health (MoH) across the 10 provinces of Zambia. Results. Of the participating hospitals, only 5.9% (n=1) and 40% (n=2) of Second-Level Hospitals (SLH) and Third-Level Hospitals (TLH), respectively, carried out tympanoplasty, myringotomy, and grommet insertion (M+G). Frontal trephination and external ethmoidectomy were offered in 11.7% (n=2) and 40% (n=2) of SLH and TLH, respectively. While tracheostomy (39.3%, n=24), tonsillectomy (27.9%, n=17), and adenoidectomy (27.9%, n=17) were the most widely performed head and neck procedures, laryngectomy was carried out by 1 hospital. Between 14.8% (n=9) and 36.1% (n=22) of hospitals lacked antibiotic and/or antiseptic ear drops. Despite 96.7% (n=59) of the respondents acknowledging ENT as an important branch of clinical practice, only 15.3% (n=4) of the hospitals had a budget for ENT. Also, 6.6% (n=4) of the respondents thought the discipline of ENT had received enough attention. Conclusion. ENT service delivery in Zambia is limited with regard to performed surgical procedures and availability of essential drugs, necessitating urgent intervention. The findings from this study may be used to direct national policy on the improvement of provision of ENT services in Zambia.

AB  - Purpose Although attenuation of tube-induced coughing is necessary in specific types of surgery, the best method for such attenuation is still unclear. We studied the combined intervention of endotracheal lidocaine and intravenous remifentanil compared to intravenous remifentanil alone with respect to coughing during emergence from anesthesia.
   Methods We examined 60 ASA 1-2 patients (age, 20-69 years) undergoing tympanoplasty under general anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. The trachea was intubated using a laryngotracheal instillation of topical anaesthetic (LITA) tracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil (0.1-0.3 mu g/kg/min). Propofol was discontinued and remifentanil (0.1 mu g/kg/min) was continued at the end of the operation. Patients were randomly allocated to the lidocaine (n = 30) and control groups (n = 30). We administered 3 ml 4 % lidocaine via the LITA tube to patients in lidocaine group at the end of the operation. The trachea was extubated when the patient regained consciousness and followed orders. Coughing was evaluated using a 4-point scale by an observer who examined the video records at extubation.
   Results Fewer patients in lidocaine group (8 of 30) than in control group (18 of 30, p < 0.01) coughed. Fewer patients in lidocaine group (2 of 30) than in control group (12 of 30, p < 0.01) had moderate or severe cough (scale 2 or 3).
   Conclusions This study is consistent with the finding that endotracheal lidocaine administration and continuous infusion of remifentanil before extubation is useful to prevent coughing on emergence from anesthesia.

AB  - Key PointsQuestionWhat differences between 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional endoscopy are important in endoscopic ear surgery? FindingsIn this cohort study including 16 inexperienced and experienced surgeons, surgical assessment revealed similar operating times for both techniques with a slight advantage for the 3-dimensional technique when used by inexperienced surgeons. Surgeons indicated a preference for the 3-dimensional technique, even though a higher incidence of eye strain was observed; recordings of eye movements suggest the need for dedicated training in 3-dimensional endoscopy, even for experienced surgeons. MeaningsThree-dimensional endoscopy appears to be suitable for endoscopic ear surgery, especially for inexperienced surgeons whose mental model of the intervention has still to be consolidated; the application of 3-dimensional endoscopy in clinical routines and for educational purposes may be feasible and beneficial.
   ImportanceEndoscopic ear surgery (EES) is an emerging technique to treat middle ear diseases; however, the interventions are performed in 2-dimensional (2D) endoscopic views, which do not provide depth perception. Recent technical developments now allow the application of 3-dimensional (3D) endoscopy in EES. ObjectiveTo investigate the usability, advantages, and disadvantages of 3D vs 2D endoscopy in EES under standardized conditions. Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cohort study conducted at a tertiary academic medical center in Bern, Switzerland, included 16 residents and consultants of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, Inselspital, Bern. InterventionsEach participant performed selected steps of a type I tympanoplasty and stapedotomy in 3D and 2D views in a cadaveric model using a randomized, Latin-square crossover design. Main Outcomes and MeasuresTime taken to perform the EES, number of attempts, and accidental damage during the dissections were compared between 3D and 2D endoscopy. Eye tracking was performed throughout the interventions. Cognitive load and subjective feedback were measured by standardized questionnaires. ResultsOf the 16 surgeons included in the study (11 inexperienced residents; 5 experienced consultants), 8 were women (50%); mean age was 36 years (range, 27-57 years). Assessment of surgical time revealed similar operating times for both techniques (181 seconds in 2D vs 174 seconds in 3D). A total of 64 surgical interventions were performed. Most surgeons preferred the 3D technique (10 for 3D vs 6 for 2D), even though a higher incidence of eye strain, measured on a 7-point Likert scale, was observed (3D, 2.19 points vs 2D, 1.44 points; mean difference , 0.74; 95% CI, 0.29-1.20; r=0.67). Eye movement assessment revealed a higher duration of fixation for consultants in 2D (0.79 seconds) compared with 3D endoscopy (0.54 seconds), indicating a less-efficient application of previously acquired experiences using the new technique. Residents (mean [SD], 49.02 [16.4]) had a significantly higher workload than consultants (mean [SD], 27.21 [12.20]), independent of the used technique or task. Conclusions and RelevanceThree-dimensional endoscopy is suitable for EES, especially for inexperienced surgeons whose mental model of the intervention has yet to be consolidated. The application of 3D endoscopy in clinical routines and for educational purposes may be feasible and beneficial.
   This cohort study compares the use of 3-dimensional vs 2-dimensional endoscopes by surgeons performing endoscopic ear surgery.

AB  - Objective: To analyze current ratio of neurotologists to the population and examine regional variation.
   Study Design: Population survey examining hospital referral regions (HRRs) as defined in the Dartmouth Atlas of Health Care Project and location of members of the American Neurotology Society.
   Main Outcome Measure: Ratio of neurotologists to the population within designated HRRs.
   Results: The national estimate of practicing neurotologists per population in 2006 was 1:922664 persons. The ratio is not uniform across HRRs, indicating that referral patterns for neurotologic care are wider than the care for indicators used in designating HRRs. Distribution of specialists is closely correlated with population. Estimated procedures per population are stable or declining for lateral cranial base surgery, implying current or impending oversupply of neurotologists.
   Conclusion: The number of specialists in Neurotology likely exceeds projected needs. The current supply of trainees predicts this trend will continue for decades. Development and maintenance of lateral cranial base surgical skills will be difficult for some practitioners.

KW  - MYRINGOPLASTY
AB  - Objectives
   Inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty (IBCT) is a simple grafting technique. Endoscopy facilitates visualization by eliminating blind spots. We analyzed the outcomes of IBCT using both endoscopic and microscopic approaches, and assessed how trainees perceived the educational opportunities afforded.
   Materials and methods
   Sixty patients who underwent IBCT were allocated to Group I (n = 30; microscopic IBCT) and Group II (n = 30; endoscopic IBCT) by the dates of their visits. Anatomical success was defined as an intact, repaired tympanic membrane; functional success was defined as a significant decrease in the air-bone gap. Postoperative discomfort was analyzed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Thirteen trainees completed structured questionnaires exploring anatomical identification and the surgical steps.
   Results
   The surgical success rates were 96.7% in Group I and 100% in Group II. We found no between-group differences in the mean decrease in the air-bone gap or the extent of postoperative discomfort. Significant postoperative hearing improvements were evident in both groups. The mean operative time was shorter when the microscopic approach was chosen (17.7 +/- 4.53 vs. 26.13 +/- 9.94 min). The two approaches significantly differed in terms of the identification of external and middle ear anatomical features by the trainees, and their understanding of the surgical steps.
   Conclusion
   Both endoscopic and microscopic IBCT were associated with good success rates. The endoscopic approach facilitates visualization, and a better understanding of the middle ear anatomy and the required surgical steps and thus is of greater educational utility.

AB  - Objective: To compare the effect of remifentanil combined with desflurane or isoflurane on the quality of the operative field and surgical conditions, blood loss, and recovery during tympanoplasty or endoscopic sinus surgery.
   Design: Randomised, double-blinded clinical study.
   Subjects: Sixty-four patients were scheduled for elective tympanoplasty or endoscopic sinus surgery. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: desflurane or isoflurane. After anaesthesia induction, all patients received a continuous remifentanil infusion of 0.2-0.5 mu g/kg/min until a mean arterial pressure of 65-75 mmHg was achieved. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were recorded throughout anaesthesia. Blood loss was measured at the end of surgery. Achievement of a bloodless operative field was rated on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Following completion of surgery, the time to extubation and to achievement of an Aldrete score of nine or more was recorded.
   Results: Sixty-three patients were evaluated. The total dose of remifentanil and the total blood loss were similar in both groups (p > 0.05). Time to extubation and to an Aldrete score of nine or more for the desflurane group was significantly less than for the isoflurane group (p < 0.05). No differences were found in the extent of achievement of a bloodless operative field, as assessed via visual analogue scale, comparing the study groups (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: Although desflurane and isoflurane both enabled good surgical conditions (in terms of quality of operative field) and convenient induction of hypotension for tympanoplasty and endoscopic sinus surgery, the recovery characteristics of desflurane were better than those of isoflurane. Therefore, desflurane may be preferable to isoflurane in such circumstances.

AB  - Bone drilling is a common surgical procedure of knee arthroplasty, craniotomy, stapedotomy, dental treatment, and laminotomy. Although femtosecond laser processing provides a promising method for precision bone drilling, it is still challenging to achieve thermal accumulation suppression and damage protection for large-scale hole drilling. In this paper, we propose a real-time spectral response guided femtosecond laser bone drilling method with the second-harmonic-generation (SHG) signals for positioning and monitoring. SHG green signal centered at 513.5 nm is generated below laser ablation threshold of bone, which can provide as a label-free detection for initial positioning. Results show that the spectral intensity ratio of green and white signal gradually decreases due to the accelerated removal of hydroxyapatite with the increased laser fluence, while the spectral intensity ratio of red signal and other visible signal can be used to indicate the thermal damage due to the abnormal enhancement of the red signal ranging from 700 to 800 nm when carbonization occurs. Based on the real-time spectral response at different laser fluence, the key laser processing parameters including defocus distance, flow rate of cooling water, and laser fluence are successfully optimized. Finally, a damage-free hole with the average diameter of 3 mm and the depth of 3.6 mm is successfully drilled within 5 min, while the temperature of surrounding hole wall is 37.1 degrees C. The proposed method provides a direct-viewing, damage-free and high-efficiency way of laser bone drilling with real-time positioning and monitoring.

AB  - Purpose To characterize postoperative pain after tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy and correlate between pain severity and various technical aspects of the surgery. Methods We carried out a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing ear surgery in a tertiary referral center between 7/2018 and 7/2019. Patients filled in a pain questionnaire and scored pain intensity on a visual analog scale preoperatively and on postoperative days (POD) 1-4, 21, and 49. The responses were correlated with clinical and operative data, including surgical technique-related details. Results Sixty-two patients participated in the study (27 males and 35 females, average age 41.1 +/- 20.02 years [range 18-68]). The median preoperative VAS was 5, followed by 6 on POD1, 5 on POD3, and 1 at 3 and 9 weeks. The preoperative questionnaire score normalized to 10 was 4.5 (32/70), 5.1 on POD1, 4.7 on POD3, 0.85 at 3 weeks and 0.85 at 9 weeks. The predictive factors for increased postoperative pain were younger age, the presence of a comorbidity, revision surgery, preoperative dizziness or tinnitus and postoperative tinnitus. The predictive factors for decreased pain were smoking and the addition of a mastoidectomy. None of the factors related to the surgical technique (e.g., surgical approaches, type of reconstruction, specific surgeon) significantly affected the questionnaire responses or the pain VAS intensity scores. Conclusions We demonstrated that younger age, the presence of a comorbidity, revision surgery, preoperative dizziness or tinnitus and postoperative tinnitus were predictors of increased pain after tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy, while the inclusion of a mastoidectomy was a predictor of decreased pain.

AB  - Background: Hearing loss caused by middle ear malformations is treated by tympanoplasty to reconstruct the acoustic conduction system. The mobility of the ossicles plays a crucial role in postoperative success. However, identifying the location of ossicular malformation based solely on preoperative audiograms is challenging due to the complex relationship between fixation location, deformity levels, and ossicular mobility. Methods: Middle ear finite element models for simulating ossicular malformations were created, and the results were compared with the actual preoperative audiograms. Results: This approach objectively diagnosed ossicular fixation and disarticulation, bypassing traditional criteria reliant on physician examination or imaging. Conclusion: This study suggests that future research should focus on developing a diagnostic framework utilizing large-scale data.

AB  - Objective: To describe an effective technique for mastoid cavity obliteration in canal wall down tvinpanomastoidectomy for chronic otitis media and review its efficacy in producing a dry, low-maintenance, small mastoid cavity.
   Design: Retrospective clinical study of a consecutive series of procedures from 1995 to 2000.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center and institutional academic practice in otology and neurotology.
   Patients: Sixty consecutive procedures for active chronic otitis media with a minimum follow-up of 12 months (mean, 31 mo; range, 12-80 mo).
   Intervention: All patients had canal wall down mastoidectomy with simultaneous tympanoplasty including split-thickness skin grafting. An inferiorly pedicled, periosteal-pericranial flap was used in conjunction with autologous bone pate to obliterate the mastoid cavity. The additional length provided by the pericranial extension of the flap permitted it to reach superior to the lateral canal and into the sinodural angle, with improved coverage of bone pate and better reduction of cavity size.
   Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was control of suppuration and creation of a dry, low-maintenance mastoid cavity, which was assessed using a previously developed serniquantitative scale. This scale includes a temporal dimension to assess control of infection. Secondary outcome measures included postoperative complications (i.e., hematoma, infection, flap necrosis, and meatal stenosis) and incidence of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma. Results: Forty-nine ears (82%) maintained a small, dry, healthy mastoid cavity. Five ears (8%) had intermittent otorrhea easily controlled by topical treatment. Six ears (10%) had suboptimal control of otorrhea, of which four had meatal stenosis. There were no residual or recurrent cholesteatomas. Outcomes remained stable over progressively longer follow-up, up to 80 months.
   Conclusion: Obliteration of a canal wall down mastoid cavity by a postauricular periosteal-pericranial flap with autologous bone pate is a reliable and effective technique that results in a dry, trouble-free mastoid cavity in 90% of patients with active chronic otitis media.

AB  - Electronically stored data may be used to generate feedback overviews. This paper describes a method for establishing a picture of ear surgery complications. In this prospective study, the working definition of adverse events and complications is "incidents that are not intrinsic to the surgical procedure and that have a potential or actual negative effect on surgical outcome or postoperative morbidity". A simple method is used to categorise otologic adverse events and complications. This scale varies from adverse events (grade A) to death (grade D). All adverse events and complications in ear surgery that met this definition were documented electronically as part of continuous follow-up between 1 July 1992 and 30 June 1999. In the first 3 years, 1,009 ear operations were performed, and in 51 (5%) of them, adverse events or complications were noted during or after surgery. There were 30 (3%) grade A (adverse events), 18 (2%) grade B (minor complications), 3 (0.3%) grade C (major complications) and no grade D complications. Otosclerosis surgery was evaluated additionally, because halfway through a 7-year period, the number of surgeons was changed. Only three experienced, senior members of staff were involved, and inexperienced residents no longer were allowed to perform this kind of surgery. The reduction of surgeon numbers did indeed improve the outcome of the stapes surgery. Our results were comparable to the literature. This monitoring of outcome-results in relation to changes in care can be seen as a study of care quality. A review of this kind links daily clinical practice to the literature and induces an improvement in quality.

AB  - Background and objectives: Training in surgical specialties has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. A study was carried out to further analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific aspects of clinical, training, and research activities performed by the otolaryngology residents in Spain.
   Methods: A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted during the last two weeks of February 2021. The study consisted of an online survey taken by otolaryngology residents who had undertaken one-year continuing training from February 15, 2020, to February 15, 2021, and consisted of 26 questions exploring the impact of the COVID-19 on the health of the ENT residents and training activities. Categorical variables were reported as frequency and percentage. When indicated, Pearsoni Chi-square test (chi(2)) with Yates's correction and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) were used.
   Results: 143 completed surveys were received from 264 residents (54.17%). 36 residents (25.2%) have suffered from the disease due to SARS-CoV-2. Most of them only developed mild symptoms (86.1%), with 3 requiring hospitalization (8.3%). The origin of infection was unknown in all reported cases and the need for confinement was principally due to either attending an asymptomatic patient in 9 cases (6.3%) or to being supposedly in close contact with an asymptomatic person in 22 (15.4%). 60.1% of the residents surveyed reported having lost more than 6 months of their training period, and in 18.8% of cases, it was as high as 10 and 12 months. There has been a reduction of more than 75% of what was planned in surgical training (P< .05) of tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy, stapedectomy, cochlear implants, endoscopic sinonasal and anterior skull base surgery, septoplasty and turbinoplasty.
   Conclusions: The decline in ENT activity and residents having to assist in other COVID-19 units during the most critical moments of the pandemic, has caused the main reduction in their training capacity. Contagion mainly occurred through contact with asymptomatic carriers during patient care and through supposedly close contact with asymptomatic carriers. Virtual activities have been widely accepted, but they have not completely replaced all residents' training needs. Measures should be implemented to recover lost training, especially surgical practical learning in otology and rhinology.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Measurements derived from tests of the performance of the eustachian tube (ET) under a variety of normal and pathologic conditions are widely diffuse and overlap considerably. In this survey, the deflation opening pressure (DOP) of the ET was tested in 31 patients suffering either from recurrent otitis (these patients had ventilating tubes inserted) or from chronic otitis media. Oxygen was deflated from the external ear canal, through the middle ear to the pharyngeal end of the ET. The DOP was  the pressure needed for the passing of the oxygen. This pressure was usually between 100 to 200 mm H2O. No difference was found in the DOP between infants and adults or between discharging ears and dry ones. A second measurement was obtained through measuring the deflation flow pressure (DFP) required for the continuous passage of oxygen through the ET. The DFP was less than the DOP by approximately 20 to 60 mm H2O, and again no difference was noted between age groups or between infected and  noninfected ears. It was concluded that DOP and DFP measurements of the ET are similar in a variety of conditions and therefore cannot indicate whether the ET is normally or abnormally functioning. The existence of a linear connection between the health of the ET and its performance is not proven; hence the role of the ET in predicting the likely outcome of tympanoplasty should be assessed within a different context.

AB  - Objective: Isolated congenital stapes ankylosis is rare but is a definite entity. Both small series and case reports have been published in various languages. The aim of this study was to review the world literature regarding isolated congenital stapes ankylosis and to critically evaluate the embryonic development of the stapes to explain the possible pathologic development of this ankylosis.
   Data Sources: All the publications in the English, German, and French literature regarding congenital stapes anomalies were reviewed, and original research articles on the embryonic development of the stapes and related structures were extensively and critically reviewed.
   Study Selection: Of the many varieties of congenital stapes anomalies described in the literature, only the isolated congenital stapes fixation due to footplate or suprastructure fixations were selected in this study.
   Data Synthesis: After extensive and critical review of the embryonic development of the stapes, the complex and confusing embryonic development is explained in a simplified way with schematic illustrations for easy understanding. The possible theories of congenital stapes ankylosis are explained on an embryologic basis and supplemented with schematic illustrations.
   Conclusion: Based on the development of the stapes an attempt has been made to explain the possible theories for the basis of suprastructure fixation. Theories of congenital fixation of footplate also discussed.

AB  - Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) rarely occurs in the external auditory canal (EAC). A case of PA complicated with chronic otitis media is reported. The patient was a 36-year-old male who began to experience a hearing loss in the left ear in 1996. He sought medical attention only after ear pain developed in April 2003. At the initial examination, a tumor covered by smooth skin was seen filling the left EAC. Pure-tone audiometry showed residual hearing at low frequencies and scale-out across middle to high frequency range. The CT and MRI findings led to a diagnosis of a tumor of the left EAC complicated with an inflammatory middle-ear lesion. The tumor was excised en bloc with the overlying skin, and tympanoplasty was performed. The pathological diagnosis was PA of the left EAC and inflammatory granuloma of the middle ear.

AB  - Many difficulties might be encountered during conventional stapes surgery. However, the good exposure provided by the endoscope can facilitate this procedure. The present study addresses the effectiveness of endoscopic stapes surgery with regard to the operation time and patients' convenience and satisfaction. 19 patients underwent endoscopic stapes surgery without packing. 15 patients who experienced the microscopic stapes surgery served as the comparison group. Audiometric results and the patients' satisfaction as measured by visual analog scale in both group were compared. Audiometric results were similar in both groups. Nevertheless, the endoscopic method was accompanied by shorter operation time and more comfort for the patients. Totally endoscopic stapes surgery can be done in much shorter time without major difficulties and without need to pack ear canal after surgery. Far less dissection and incision as well as patients' more satisfaction make this technique as a good alternative to the microscopic approach to stapes surgery.

AB  - IMPORTANCE The ideal surgical treatment of cholesteatoma has been subject to discussion for years because both traditional surgical techniques (canal wall down [CWD] and canal wall up [CWU] tympanoplasty) have their own advantages and disadvantages. A more recently propagated surgical approach, to combine the CWD or CWU tympanoplasty technique with obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanum, is showing promising results.
   OBJECTIVE To systematically review the literature on recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rates after single-stage CWU and CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW A systematic search of literature was performed to identify relevant publications in multiple electronic databases. The initial search was conducted in December 2016 and was updated in July 2017. Each study was reviewed by 2 independent reviewers on predetermined eligibility criteria. The methodological quality was determined using the methodological index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS) scale, and the relevance to the current topic was determined using a 4-criterion checklist.
   FINDINGS The searches identified a total of 336 potentially relevant publications; 190 articles were excluded based on title and abstract. The full-text articles of the remaining 146 citations were assessed for eligibility, resulting in 22 articles. After assessing these remaining articles for methodological quality and relevance to the current topic, another 8 studies were excluded, and a total of 13 studies (1534 patients) were included. Of the 1534 patients who underwent CWD or CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, the rate of recurrent disease was 4.6%, and the rate of residual disease was 5.4%. In CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, these rates were 0.28% and 4.2%, respectively and in CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, 5.9% and 5.8%, respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE We show the recurrent and residual disease rates after either CWU or CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration to be qualitatively similar to, if not better than, previously reported rates of for nonobliterative techniques. In this study, the lowest recurrent and residual rates were reported when combining the CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, on average 0.28 and 4.2%, respectively.

AB  - Background: Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) is the inability of the Eustachian tube (ET) to adequately perform at least one of its functions: to protect the middle ear from sources of disease, to ventilate the middle ear, and to help drain secretions away from the middle ear. There are a number of treatment options for ETD, but there is little consensus about management.
   Objectives: To determine the clinical effectiveness of interventions for adult ETD and to identify gaps in the evidence to inform future research.
   Data sources: Twelve databases were searched up to October 2012 for published and unpublished studies in English (e. g. MEDLINE from 1946, EMBASE from 1974, Biosis Previews from 1969 and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature from inception). References of included studies, relevant systematic reviews and regulatory agency websites were checked.
   Review methods: A systematic review was undertaken. Controlled studies evaluating prespecified treatments for adult patients diagnosed with ETD were eligible. Uncontrolled studies with at least 10 participants were included for interventions where no controlled studies were found. Outcomes included change in symptoms severity/ frequency (primary outcome), quality of life, middle ear function, hearing, clearance of middle ear effusion, early ventilation tube extrusion, additional treatment, adverse events and complications. All aspects of the review process were performed using methods to reduce reviewer error and bias. Owing to heterogeneous data, a quantitative synthesis could not be performed, and results were reported in a narrative synthesis.
   Results: Nineteen studies were included: three randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and two non-RCTs evaluating pharmacological interventions or mechanical devices for middle ear pressure equalisation; and 13 case series and one retrospective controlled before-and-after study evaluating surgical interventions. None was conducted in the UK. All studies were small (11 to 108 participants). Most non-surgical studies reported including mixed populations of adults and children. All except two studies were at high risk of bias, and subject to multiple limitations. Based on a single RCT, nasal steroids showed no improvement in symptoms or middle ear function for patients with otitis media with effusion and/or negative middle ear pressure. Very short-term improvements in middle ear function were observed in patients receiving directly applied topical decongestants or a combination of antihistamine and ephedrine. Single trials found two pressure equalisation devices were each associated with significant short-term improvements in symptoms, middle ear function and/or hearing. Eustachian tuboplasty (seven case series) and balloon dilatation (three case series) were associated with improved outcomes. Positive results were also reported for myringotomy (two case series), directly applied topical steroids (one case series) and laser point coagulation (one controlled before-and-after study). High rates of co-interventions were documented. Minor complications of surgery and pharmacological treatments but no serious adverse effects were reported.
   Limitations: The evidence was limited in quantity and overall was of poor quality. No data were identified on several interventions despite extensive searches.
   Conclusions: It is not possible to draw conclusions regarding the effectiveness of any of the interventions for the treatment of adults with an ETD diagnosis, and there is insufficient evidence to recommend a trial of any particular intervention. Further research is needed to address lack of consensus on several issues, including the definition of ETD in adults, its relation to broader middle ear ventilation problems and clear diagnostic criteria.
   Study registration: This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42012003035.

AB  - Objectives: To demonstrate that 1) recent graduates of training programs in otorhinolaryngology-head and neck surgery are less likely to recommend/perform stapedectomy than more senior otolaryngologists; and 2) when surgery is recommended, referral is most commonly made to an otologist/neurotologist.
   Study Design: Survey of 500 regional otolaryngologists pertaining to their treatment of patients with hearing loss secondary to otosclerosis.
   Methods: Otolaryngologists in community practice were provided with written surveys pertaining to their treatment of otosclerosis.
   Results: Data were obtained from 179 general otolaryngologists treating adults and children in solo or group private practices in our geographic region. The majority (66%) diagnosed one to five new cases per year. Ten percent of surgeons graduating in the 1970s, 25% graduating in the 1980s, 50% graduating in the 1990s, and 90% of graduates in the 2000s never performed stapedectomy as part of their practices (P < .001). Similarly, a significant number of surgeons who formerly performed stapedectomies no longer do this surgery. A trend toward greater use of hearing aids for the treatment of otosclerosis was seen in more recent graduates (P < .08). When surgery was recommended, otologists/neurotologists received the majority of referrals (75%) from the practitioners surveyed.
   Conclusions: Stapedectomy is performed and recommended less often by more recent graduates of otolaryngology training programs. Training requirements for both general otolaryngologists and neurotologists may need modification given current practice patterns for stapes surgery.

AB  - Delayed onset of facial palsy is possibly an underestimated but distressing complication of acoustic neuroma surgery. The incidence of this complication reported in the literature has varied from 11.7 to 41%. This study reviewed retrospectively 60 primary acoustic neuroma surgeries performed by a single neurotologist. The delayed onset of facial dysfunction was defined according to the guidelines described by of Lalwani Butt, Jackler, Pitts and Jingling in 1995. They considered either a deterioration of facial function from normal to abnormal or an increased severity of the degree of facial paralysis, which was grouped using the House-Brackmann scale system. Fifteen of the 60 patients (25%) were found to have a deterioration of facial function. The incidence of delayed facial palsy was not influenced by age, sex or tumor size. The majority of the patients had a favorable prognosis Only three patients had a grade III-IV facial function at 1 year. It is possible that these latter cases might have benefited from intraoperative meatal facial nerve decompression, as advocated by Sargent, Kartush and Graham.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this work was to report our modified cartilage plate tympanoplasty technique ("tulip leaves") and to analyze its clinical outcome in primary and recurrent cases of chronic otitis media with and without cholesteatoma.
   Study Design: Clinical retrospective study.
   Methods: Patients being operated on with this technique at the University Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Dresden, Germany, between 1993 and 2001 were invited for survey, otomicroscopy, and pure-tone audiometry in 2003. Patients' charts were used to draw necessary conclusions.
   Results: A total of 39 patients who were treated with this technique after canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy and cavity obliteration were included in this long-term analysis after a median follow-up of 6 years. Seventeen patients (44%) experienced chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, whereas 22 (56%) of them had a diagnosis of chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma. At the time of examination, all patients displayed a closed tympanic membrane. However, retractions were observed in 19 patients (48%). One patient required (3%) revision surgery for recurrent cholesteatoma due to prosthesis extrusion during the study period.
   Conclusion: On the basis of this study, we recommend the tuliplike arrangement of thin but large auricular cartilage slices for the reconstruction of tympanic membrane defects in high-risk ears. This combination proved its high stability and long-lasting vitality in our long-term study. These characteristics are crucial for permanent disease removal and for reducing the risk of recurrent pathologic abnormality.

AB  - Specialist training at the registrar grade in the United Kingdom has undergone significant change in the recent past. One of the effects has been a reduction in the length of time spent in training. This and the application of the European working time directive have the potential to reduce trainees' surgical exposure. The proportion of tympanic membrane reconstructive procedures performed by otolaryngology registrars in the Grampian University hospitals was audited to monitor the impact of these changes.
   Case notes of all patients who underwent myringoplasty or tympanoplasty between July 1998 and June 1999 were analysed retrospectively. Details of the surgeons' grade were recorded. The proportion of myringoplasties performed by registrars as determined by the Royal College of Surgeons of England National Comparative Audit survey, carried out in 1995 before the widespread implementation of recommended changes in otolaryngology registrar training, was set as the gold standard.
   In the period July 1998-1999 registrars had performed fewer myringoplasties than the standard, 17 per cent versus 34.2 per cent respectively (p = 0.035). A strategy to increase registrar exposure to myringoplasty surgery was then adopted by the department and the proportion of myringoplasties performed by registrars re-audited prospectively. The proportion of myringoplasties undertaken by registrars increased in the period January 2001 to July 2001 compared to July 1998-1999, 53 per cent versus 17 per cent respectively (p<0.0007).
   Changes in working practice can address shortfalls in registrars' exposure to surgical procedures.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the present study was to illustrate the learning curve of endoscopic type-1 tympanoplasty comparing experts in microscopic otology versus neophyte surgeons.
   Methods: Eight ear surgeons, from tertiary referral centers, who had performed at least 30 endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasties were included in the study. Demographic data and medical records regarding the first 30 endoscopic type-1 tympanoplasties were retrospectively collected by each surgeon. A 14-questions survey focused on subjective aspects of the learning curve was administered. Surgeons were divided in two groups: one with previous experience in microscopic ear surgery (group 1) and one with no previous experience in ear surgery (group 2). The learning curve of endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasty was compared between the groups.
   Results: Mean surgical time was 89.2 min in group 1 vs. 79.5 min in group 2 (p < 0.01). When divided in 5 surgeries-steps, the only significant difference was appreciated in the first 5 surgeries with a longer mean time in group 1 vs. group 2 (+ 28.4 min; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Surgeon's previous experience may influence the EES learning curve. Our results show that the first 5 surgical procedures are more challenging for surgeons experienced in microscopic surgery, subsequently the curve progression improves sharply and appears reversing the initial trend by the end of the 30 surgeries.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the anti-adhesive and anti-inflammatory effects of sodium hyaluronate-carboxymethylcellulose (HA-CMC) in reducing postoperative pain after temporalis fascia harvest during tympanomastoid surgery.
   Materials and methods: Between January and December 2009, 27 patients underwent tympanoplasty and open cavity mastoidectomy involving the harvesting of temporalis fasciae (more than 3 x 4 cm). At the end of surgery, patients were injected with 1.5 g HA-CMC or normal saline around the fascia harvest area. Beginning immediately postoperatively and for 2 months after surgery, patients scored their pain in the temporal area on a visual analogue scale (VAS).
   Results: There were no significant postoperative complications, such as bleeding or hematoma, in either control group. VAS scores of both groups decreased over time and were negligible after 2 months. VAS scores of the HA-CMC and control groups differed significantly (p < 0.001 by repeated measures ANOVA for all VAS scores).
   Conclusion: HA-CMC can decrease immediate postoperative pain arising from tissue adhesion and inflammation, thus reducing postoperative mastication pain. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Tympanoplasty is a commonly performed surgical procedure done by Otorhinolaryngologist for treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media. Postoperative period requires the use of analgesics which are given regularly. The study aims to assess the efficacy of a single dose of preemptive pregabalin in decreasing postoperative pain after postauricular type 1 tympanoplasty. This randomized prospective study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital between July 2017 and April 2018. A total of 60 patients were divided into two groups of 30 each. This study analyzed the effect of single preoperative use of pregabalin 150 mg oral 1 h before type 1 postauricular tympanoplasty for postoperative pain as a VAS (visual analogue scale) score and requirement of rescue analgesia and results were compared with the placebo group. Pain scores (VAS score) was significantly lower in the pregabalin group as compared to the placebo group at 6, 12, 24, and at 48 h. Rescue analgesia requirements were also lower in the pregabalin group than the placebo group. Preemptive use of a single dose of oral 150 mg pregabalin reduces postoperative pain and rescue analgesic requirement in patients undergoing type 1 tympanoplasty.

AB  - Tympanoplasty aims at rebuilding the tympanic membrane with or without middle ear functional recovery.
   Aim: To evaluate the surgical results of tympanoplasties with a retro-auricular surgical approach at a medical residency unit.
   Materials and Methods: Thirty-nine patients with diagnosis of simple chronic otitis media were evaluated; these patients underwent tymplanoplasty by a retro-auricular approach (underlay technique) at a medical residency unit. Patients were included in a prospective medical and audiologic investigation protocol that consisted of a clinical, otomicroscopic and audiometric evaluation. All procedures were supervised by training specialists otorrinolaringology.
   Results: The rate of surgical success - full integration of the graft - was 95% of cases. Improvement of hearing, as demonstrated in audiometry, occurred in 72% of cases. Improvement in tinnitus was demonstrated subjectively on a visual analog scale in 69% of cases.
   Conclusion: Tympanoplasty through a retro-auricular approach is easy to perform. Full graft integration occurred in 95% of cases and was independent of factors deemed by many authors as relevant. The results - improvement of the quality of hearing and tinnitus - were significant.

AB  - Background: Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane (TPTM) is often encountered in primary care or in the emergency department (ED). Several therapeutic interventions have been described, but conservative follow-up until spontaneous complete recovery is the most common choice. Objective: Our goal was to analyze the trauma mechanism, perforation characteristics, and outcome of patients with TPTM. Methods: The study included patients examined in the ED of a tertiary, university-affiliated medical center because of TPTM between 2012 and 2016. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, trauma mechanism, clinical characteristics, and outcome. A phone survey was performed to obtain the missing information of all the patients who did not continue their follow-up in our outpatient clinic. Results: We reviewed the histories of 80 patients with a mean age of 26.7 +/- 14.6 years (20 children; 25%). TPTM was caused by blunt trauma in 45 patients (56%) and penetrating trauma in 35 patients (44%). Thirty-five patients (44%) completed their follow-up in the hospital outpatient clinic, with a mean duration of 6.2 weeks. Twenty-five patients (38%) completed their follow-up in a community-based otolaryngology clinic, 6 patients (9%) chose not to complete their follow-up, and 14 patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 60 patients who completed follow-up, 56 patients recovered spontaneously, 3 patients underwent successful tympanoplasty, and 1 patient was referred to surgery but was lost to follow-up. All children healed spontaneously. Conclusion: TPTM was more common in young males with main mechanisms of blunt trauma (an assault) or cleaning the ear canal. All children demonstrated complete spontaneous recovery. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - CARTILAGE GRAFT
AB  - The three well recognized tympanoplasty approaches: permeatal, postaural, and endaural, each have advantages and disadvantages. The permeatal approach is suitable only for ears with adequate canal size. The postaural approach limits visualization of the posterior eardrum margin. The endaural approach limits the view of the eardrum's anterior margin. This study describes a modified endaural approach, developed to overcome these limitations. A retrospective case series review and collection of a prospective cohort of patient reported outcome data were undertaken to assess the technique.
   Method: Standard incisions as used in an endaural approach are placed within the ear canal. The novel incision extends from the superior canal incision into the conchal cavum. This allows a flap of the thick, hairbearing skin from both the bony and cartilaginous portions of the canal to be raised, and everted, to provide an excellent view of the entire drum. Perichondrium can be harvested for grafting from the conchal cavum.
   The clinical charts of all patients operated on by the first author using this technique from 2010-2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The size and position of the perforation, size of the canal, whether primary or revision surgery, graft take rate, hearing results and the occurrence of chondritis/perichondritis were recorded. To investigate the morbidities and the acceptance by the patients of the incision/scar in the conchal cavum, all patients undergoing the procedure in the 8 months up to the end of August 2013 were prospectively recruited to complete a self-assessment Likert scale questionnaire recording postoperative pain, and satisfaction with the cosmesis of the operative site. The clinician recorded if there was any evidence of chondritis/perichondritis.
   Results: A 100 % graft take rate was achieved in the 75 adults treated by the first author from 2010 to 2012 regardless of the size and position of the perforation, configuration of the canal, primary or revision surgery.
   Preoperative Pure Tone Audiometric (PTA) Air Bone Gap (ABG) averaged over 3 frequencies (0.5, 1 and 2 K Hz) was 19.4dB (standard deviation = 9.6, range 2 to 50). Postoperative PTA ABG average was 6.2 dB (standard deviation = 8.3, range -7 to 37), demonstrating a statistically significant post-surgery mean improvement of 13.2 dB (paired T-test, p < 0.001).
   Twenty-one patients who underwent the procedure in 2013, reported minimal postoperative analgesic use, and scored the acceptability of the incision scar highly (4.8 out of a maximum of 5). There was no case of chondritis/perichondritis in the 96 cases.
   Conclusion: Whilst it is the surgeon's decision to use a permeatal, postaural or endaural approach, the endaural approach with the conchal cavum modification is an excellent alternative to the traditionally described approaches.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   A comparative study to evaluate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine as a hypotensive agent in comparison to esmolol in Spine surgeries.
   METHODS
   60 patients ASA I or II scheduled for routine spine surgeries were equally randomly assigned to receive either dexmedetomidine or esmolol. In DEX group, patients received loading dose of 1 mu g/kg dexmedetomidine diluted in 10 mL 0.9% saline infused over 10 min. before induction of anaesthesia, followed by continuous infusion of 0.5 mu g/kg/h. In E group, patients received esmolol as a loading dose 1 mg/kg as 10 mL total vol. in saline infused over 1 min. followed by continuous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/h. In both groups, aim was to maintain MAP within 55-65 mmHg. All patients were premedicated with IV glycopyrrolate 5 mu g/Kg, IV midazolam 0.05 mg/kg and fentanyl 2 mu g/kg. Patients received standard anaesthetic technique with propofol 2 mg/kg. Anaesthesia was maintained with O-2, N2O, sevoflurane at 2 MAC and atracurium 0.1 mg/kg. Surgical field was assessed using Average Category Scale and average blood loss was calculated. Hemodynamic variables (MAP and HR); intraoperative fentanyl consumption; Emergence time and total recovery from anaesthesia (Aldrete score >= 9) were recorded. Sedation score was determined at 15, 30, 60 min. after tracheal extubation and time to first analgesic request was recorded.
   RESULTS
   Both DEX group and E group reached the desired MAP (55-65 mmHg) with no intergroup differences in MAP or HR. The average category scale for quality of the surgical field in the range of MAP (55-65 mmHg) were <=2 with no significant differences between group scores during hypotensive period. The induction propofol dose was significantly lower in DEX group than E group (1.63+/-0.19 mg/kg) versus (2.00+/-0.05 mg/kg) respectively (P<0.000). Baseline values of MAP and HR were comparable in both groups. Mean intraoperative fentanyl consumption in DEX group was significantly less than E group (21.67+/-22.75 pg vs 77.17+/-27.85 mu g). Emergence time and time to achieve >= 9 modified. Aldrete scores were significantly shorter in E group than DEX group .4.37+/-0.92 min. and 9.47+/-1.61 min. versus 8.5+/-1.9 min. and 4.95+/-1.24 min. (P<0.001). Incidence of intraoperative hypotension and bradycardia were seen in Esmolol group in 3.33 % cases.
   CONCLUSION
   Both dexmedetomidine and esmolol with sevoflurane are safe agents for controlled hypotension and are effective in providing ideal surgical field during spine surgeries. Compared with esmolol, dexmedetomidine offers the advantage of inherent analgesic, sedative and reduces dose of inducing agent.

AB  - The aim of present study was to observe the effect of topical application of manuka honey in healing in the healing of postoperative mastoid cavity. A total of 100 patients diagnosed with chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy, Manuka honey-soaked roller gauze pack was placed on Day 10 and was removed on day 17 and manuka honey was applied on day 17. Cavity was assessed on day 47 and day 90 on follow-up. Otoendoscopy was done on every visit to assess mastoid cavity. The primary outcome measure was the creation of a dry cavity as measured by a semi-quantitative scale as described by Merchant et al. Then Mastoid Cavity Healing Score was calculated on every visit and scoring was done at the end. On intragroup comparison it appeared that both the treatment methods exhibited improvised merchant grade score with the course of time (p-value = < 0.001). At 47th day and 90th day, the healing score in Group A was significantly higher than in Group B [p-value = < 0.001 and 0.001] respectively. We recommend Manuka honey as an adjunct to achieve a safe, dry ear in view of faster epithelization after mastoidectomy.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of low-flow sevoflurane and low-flow sevoflurane supplemented with remifentanil anesthesia on the recovery time, consumption amount of the anesthetic drugs and hemodynamic differences. Materials and Methods: A prospective, randomized and double-blinded study with 50 patients was designed. Following intubation, group S received sevoflurane 1.8 vol%, oxygen, nitrous oxide at 4 l . min(-1) and normal saline continuous infusion; group SR received sevoflurane 1.2 vol%, oxygen, nitrous oxide at 4 l . min(-1) and 0.25 mu g . kg(-1) . min(-1) remifentanil continuous infusions. Ten minutes after intubation the flow rates decreased to 1 l . min(-1). Consumption of each drug, postoperative recovery characteristics and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain were recorded. Result: There were no significant differences in hemodynamic parameters, tramadol consumption and VAS scores for pain. The patients in group SR showed faster early recovery as compared to group S. The mean consumption of sevoflurane was 18 ml in group SR, while it was 25 ml in group S. Conclusions: Low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia combined with remifentanil regimen in patients undergoing tympanoplasty surgery resulted in a faster early recovery and decreased sevoflurane consumption.

AB  - Background Microscopic type-1 tympanoplasty (T1T) is a classical method for the treatment of chronic otitis media. However, it has its limitations. The development of otoendoscopy provided a new method for T1T. Objective To investigate the difference between endoscopic T1T and microscopic T1T. Material and methods Seventy-four patients who underwent T1T were evaluated retrospectively. About 52 cases underwent endoscopic T1T, and 22 cases accepted microscopic T1T. Parameters including operative duration, incision size, graft site, duration of postoperative hospitalization, visual analog scale (VAS) score, complications, hearing improvement, and expenses were compared. Results Operative duration of endoscopic T1T (47.0 +/- 8.2 min) was shorter than microscopic T1T (58.0 +/- 9.3 min) (p < .05). The VAS score under endoscopic T1T (1.5 +/- 0.2) was lower than microscopic T1T (5.6 +/- 0.4) (p < .05). There was no complication during endoscopic T1T, but damage to the chorda tympani nerve (one case) was noted for microscopic T1T. There was no difference in hearing improvement between endoscopic (15.0 +/- 1.5 dB) and microscopic T1T (16.0 +/- 1.1 dB). Duration of postoperative hospitalization and expenses were lower for endoscopic T1T. Conclusions and significance Endoscopic T1T is a minimally invasive surgery with similar graft success rate, comparable hearing improvement, fast recovery, low cost, and high patient satisfaction compared to microscopic T1T.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To compare the hemostatic effects of commonly used concentrations of topical epinephrine in tympanoplasty. Study Design Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Methods Patients undergoing tympanoplasty were randomized to receive topical epinephrine at 1:1,000 or 1:10,000. With the investigators blinded, hemostasis was assessed with a modified Boezaart scale. Vasoconstriction was measured by laser Doppler. Blood pressure and pulse were tracked. Results Thirty patients, 4 to 84 years old, were studied, with 15 patients per group. Boezaart scores dropped a mean of 67% and 62% with 1:1,000 and 1:10,000, respectively (P = .44). Capillary blood flow decreased a mean of 50.4% and 50.9% with 1:1,000 and 1:10,000, respectively (P = .95). The mean change in heart rate and mean arterial pressure after topical epinephrine exposure were -4.9 and -0.73 beats per minute (P = .15), and -0.60 and -0.73 mmHg (P = .96) for 1:1,000 and 1:10,000 respectively. No adverse events occurred in either group. Conclusions Topical epinephrine at 1:10,000 has hemostatic efficacy comparable to 1:1,000 in tympanoplasty. Although both concentrations appear safe, use of topical epinephrine 1:10,000 should be considered over 1:1,000 to minimize the potential for adverse events. Level of Evidence 2 Laryngoscope, 2021

AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlled hypotension is a technique that is used to limit intraoperative blood loss to provide the best possible Surgical field during surgery.
   OBJECTIVE: The aim of this double-blind, randomized, controlled study was to compare the effects of desflurane combined with esmotol or dexmedetomidine on the amount of blood in the surgical field, recovery time, and tolerability in adult patients undergoing tympanoplasty.
   METHODS: Turkish patients aged IS to 60 years, classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, who were scheduled for tympanoplasty were randomly divided into 2 groups: the esmolol group or the dexmedetomidine group. After the anesthesia induction in the esmolol group, a loading dose of esmolol was infused intravenously over 1 minute at 1 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance rate of 0.4 to 0.8 mg/kg/h. In the dexmedetomidine group, a loading dose of dexmedetomidine was infused intravenously over 10 minutes at a rate of 1 mu g/kg, followed by a maintenance rate of 0.4 to 0.8 mu g/kg/h. The infusion rates were then titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 to 7 5 mm Hg. General anesthesia was maintained with desflurane 4% to 6%. Heart rate (HR) and MAP were recorded during anesthesia. The following 6-point scale was used to assess the amount of bleeding in the operative field: 0 = no bleeding, a virtually bloodless field; 1 = bleeding that was so mild that it was not a surgical nuisance; 2 = moderate bleeding that was a nuisance but did not interfere with accurate dissection; 3 = moderate bleeding that moderately compromised surgical dissection; 4 = bleeding that was heavy but controllable and that significantly interfered with surgical dissection; and 5 = massive bleeding that was uncontrollable and made dissection impossible. Scores ! 2 were considered to be optimal surgical conditions. The sedation score was determined at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after tracheal extubation using the following scale: 1. = anxious, agitated, or restless; 2 cooperative, oriented, and tranquil; 3 = responsive to commands; 4 = asleep, but with brisk response to light, glabellar tap, or loud auditory stimulus; 5 = asleep, sluggish response to glabellar tap or auditory stimulus; and 6 = asleep, no response. Time to extubation and to total recovery from anesthesia (Aldrete score >= 9 on a scale of 0-10), adverse effects (eg, intraoperative hypotension [blood pressure <65 mm Hg], bradycardia [HR <50 beats/min]), intraoperative fentanyl consumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting were recorded. Arterial blood gas analysis and kidney and liver function tests were conducted. All patients were evaluated by the same attending surgeon and anesthesiologist, both of whom were blinded to the administered study drugs.
   RESULTS: Fifty-two consecutive white patients undergoing tympanoplasty were identified. Two patients had to be excluded because of hypertension and 2 refused to participate. Forty-eight patients were equally randomized to either the esmolol group (n = 24 [16 women, 8 men]; mean [SD] age, 38.4 [10.5] years) or the dexmedetomidine group (n = 24 [17 women, 7 men]; mean age, 35.5 [14.7] years). Sedation scores were not collected for I patient in the esmolol group; therefore, analysis was conducted for 23 patients. The median (range) of the scores for the amount of blood in the surgical field in the esmolol and dexmedetomidine groups was 1 (0-3) and 1 (0-2), respectively (P = NS). Mean intracoperative fentanyl consumption in the esmolol group was significantly higher than in the dexmedetomidine group (50.0 [3-0] vs 25.0 [2-5] mu g/min; P = 0.002). In the esmolol group, the mean times to extubation and to recovery from anesthesia were significantly shorter than those of the dexmedetomidine group (7.0 [1.4] vs 9.1 [1.9] minutes, respectively; 5.9 [2.1] vs 7.9 [2.3] minutes; both, P = 0.001). The mean sedation scores were significantly lower in the esmolol group (n = 23, because of intent-to-treat analysis) compared with the dexmedetomidine group at 15 minutes (2.5 [0.6] vs 3.6 [0.5]; P = 0.001) and 30 minutes (2.6 [0.6] vs 3.3 [0.6]; P = 0.001) postoperatively. No significant differences were found between the study groups in regard to blood urea nitrogen or creatinine concentration, aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase activities, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, or bicarbonate, before or after the operation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Both esmolol and dexmedetomidine, combined with desflurane, provided an effective and well-tolerated method of achieving controlled hypotension to limit the amount of blood in the surgical field in these adult patients undergoing tympanoplasty. Esmolol was associated with significantly shorter extubation and recovery times and significantly less postoperative sedation compared with dexmedetomidine.

AB  - ObjectivesDissection of cadaveric temporal bones (TBs) is considered the gold standard for surgical training in otology. For many reasons, access to the anatomical laboratory and cadaveric TBs is difficult for some facilities. The aim of this prospective and comparative study was to evaluate the usefulness of a physical TB prototype for drilling training in residency.
   DesignProspective study.
   SettingTertiary referral centre.
   ParticipantsThirty-four residents were included. Seventeen residents (mean age 26.71.6) drilled on only cadaveric TBs (traditional group), in the traditional training method, while seventeen residents (mean age 26.51.7) drilled first on a prototype and then on a cadaveric TB (prototype group).
   Main outcome measuresDrilling performance was assessed using a validated scale. Residents completed a mastoid image before and after each drilling to enable evaluation of mental representations of the mastoidectomy.
   ResultsNo differences were observed between the groups with respect to age, drilling experience and level of residency. Regarding drilling performance, we found a significant difference across the groups, with a better score in the prototype group (P=.0007). For mental representation, the score was statistically improved (P=.0003) after drilling in both groups, suggesting that TB drilling improves the mental representation of the mastoidectomy whether prototype or cadaveric TB is used.
   ConclusionThe TB prototype improves the drilling performance and mental representation of the mastoidectomy in the young resident population. A drilling simulation with virtual or physical systems seems to be a beneficial tool to improve TB drilling.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Various materials are used to perform post-mastoidectomy mastoid obliteration (MO) to reduce the risk of recurrent infections, stasis of secretions, or caloric dizziness. Autologous materials used as fillers for MO tend to be insufficient owing to shrinkage over time or inadequate volume of these substances. Synthetic materials are unsatisfactory for MO because of the risk of rejection and extrusion. We investigated the safety and effectiveness of bone allografts for post-mastoidectomy MO. Subjects and Methods: We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent mastoidectomy with MO between January 2013 and January 2021. In the MO group, bone allografts were additionally used to fill the residual mastoid cavity. In the canal wall down (CWD) group, all patients underwent CWD mastoidectomy with use of additional inferiorly based mucoperiosteal flaps. Results: The study included the MO group (23 ears) and the CWD group (53 ears). In the MO group, compared with the preoperative status, we observed a decrease in the tendency of the air-bone gap postoperatively. Compared with the CWD group, the total complication rate showed a decreasing tendency in the MO group. Conclusions: No patient showed post-MO shrinkage of the grafted bone allograft or otorrhea. Further large-scale studies are warranted to confirm the advantages of bone allografts for MO, including maintenance with time and sufficient amount.

AB  - Tympanic membrane (TM) is vulnerable to a variety of middle ear diseases. In some cases, reconstruction or repair of the TM is essential for recovering the hearing. Although there are many kinds of materials and therapeutics for TM reconstruction, tissue engineering of the TM is still in its initial steps of advancement. Treatment of damaged TM is usually carried out by otology-related techniques such as myringoplasty and tympanoplasty. Most of the novel tympanoplasty methods employ artificial grafts made of biomaterials and polymers for scaffolds. One biomaterial candidate for design and fabrication of synthetic grafts is spider silk, which has excellent mechanical and acoustic characteristics. On the other hand, the structural function of the spider web is also one of the potential inspirations for designing tissue-engineered grafts on micro-scale explorations. In this study, a bio-inspired design and analysis of silky TM grafts are carried out employing finite element modeling and vibro-acoustic investigation. A comparative and statistical analysis is also performed with experimentally validated data to check the suitability of the materials and design. The numerical study shows that the proposed bioinspired models are appropriate for TM graft design and fabrication. The effects of inspired architecture and materials on obtaining an optimum design for TM grafts are put into evidence via a parametric study, and pertinent conclusions are outlined.

AB  - Objective: To investigate and analyze the relationship between individual ossicular erosion and air-bone gap (ABG) among patients with cholesteatoma.
   Study Design: Retrospective case review.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Subjects and Methods: Data from all patients undergoing an initial surgery for cholesteatoma were retrospectively reviewed to evaluate the relationships between preoperative pure tone audiometry data, intraoperative assessment of individual ossicular destruction, and clinical characterization of cholesteatoma. For each patient, the cholesteatoma was categorized as primary acquired, secondary acquired, congenital, or unable to discern. Ossicular destruction was graded, and ABG was calculated. For each ossicle, the relationship between degree of cholesteatoma involvement and ossicular erosion and the ABG was analyzed using univariate and multivariate linear regression.
   Results: A total of 158 primary cholesteatoma surgeries were performed by the senior author between 1992 and 2009 that met our inclusion criteria. The status of each ossicle was significantly associated with the ABG in a graded and independent manner; this association was most significant for the incus. Cholesteatoma abutting an intact ossicle did not significantly affect the ABG. Clinical categorization of cholesteatoma was not significantly associated with the ABG.
   Conclusion: Previous assessments of ossicular destruction have provided limited information about the relationship between ossicular destruction and ABG in cholesteatoma patients. Through the use of a new and detailed grading scale, this study reveals that the erosion of each ossicle contributes in a graded and independent manner to the increase in ABG, with the status of the incus having the most statistically significant association with ABG.

We analyzed the graft uptake success rate in 5 weeks and the perforation closure rate in 4 months after surgery. We also compared the air-bone gap (ABG) before and after the surgery.ResultsAmong the 60 ears included, the mean age was 57.0 years, and 78.3% (47 of 60) had small perforations. The average operation time was 48.9 +/- 11.5 minutes, and the postoperative NRS was 2.0 +/- 1.6. The immediate graft uptake success rate evaluated at postoperative 5 weeks was 96.7% (58 of 60), with myringitis occurring in three ears. Except for 11 patients lost to follow-up, the perforation closure rate evaluated at postoperative 4 months was 100% (49 of 49). The mean ABG significantly improved from preoperative status (8.87 +/- 5.51 dB HL) to postoperative 4 months (6.22 +/- 6.03 dB HL) (p = 0.019).ConclusionsA single surgeon's success rate for endoscopic butterfly inlay cartilage myringoplasty was almost 100%. This surgical procedure is safe and effective, with a high graft success rate.

AB  - Study Objective: To determine the effect of dexmedetomidine on intraoperative bleeding during septoplasty and tympanoplasty operations.
   Design: Randomized. placebo-controlled study.
   Setting: Univesity medical center.
   Patients: 80 ASA physical status I and II patients, aged 18 to 05 years, 40 of whom were scheduled for septoplasty and 40 to undergo tympanoplasty operations.
   Interventions: Patients undergoing septoplasty (S) and tympanoplasty (T) operations were randomly divided into 4 groups. Dexmedetomidine (D) was administered to Group SD and Group TD first as a bolus close of one mu g kg(-1), then intraoperative maintenance was supplied with dexmedetomidine 0.7 mu g kg(-1) hour(-1). Groups S and T (controls) were given identical amounts of saline. If systolic blood pressure measurements are greater than 20% preoperative values, then fentanyl one mu g kg(-1) was given.
   Measurements: Intraoperative blood loss was determined with suction volumes and gauze counting. Bleeding was rated according to a 6-point scale. Hemodynamic parameters and fentanyl administration were recorded.
   Main Results: Group SI) had less bleeding and lower bleeding scores (P < 0.05). In addition, this group received less intraoperative fentanyl (P < 0.05). The only significant difference between Groups TD and T was the amount of intraoperative fentanyl given (35.4 +/- 58.8 vs 110.0 +/- 81.0 mu g) (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Dexmedetomidine reduces bleeding, bleeding, scores, and intraoperative fentanyl consumption during general anesthesia in septoplasty operations. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - STAPEDOTOMY
AB  - Background There is a need for sensor-guided robotic devices that discriminate working conditions and media, and control interaction of tool-points with respect to tissues. At the micro-surgical scale the need is to control exact penetration through flexible tissues and to control relative motion with respect to moving or deforming tissue targets and interfaces. Methods This paper describes a smart surgical drill that is able to control interaction with respect to the flexing tissue to avoid penetration or to control the extent of protrusion with respect to the position of the flexible tissue interface under drilling. The sensing scheme used is able to discriminate between the variations in types of conditions posed in the drilling environment. Results The fully autonomous system is able to respond to tissue type, behaviour and deflection in real time. The system is robust in terms of different drilling angle, thickness, stiffness, and disturbances encountered. Also it is intuitive to use, efficient to set up and uses standard drill bits. Conclusions The smart drill has been used to prepare cochleostomies in theatre and was used to remove bone tissue leaving the endosteal membrane intact. This has enabled preservation of sterility and the drilling debris to be removed prior to insertion of the electrode. Results presented in this paper suggest that the robotic smart drill is tolerant and robust on various angled drilling trajectories with respect to tissues, tissue thickness, environmental disturbances, and has been used within the operating theatre.

   Methods: In the present study, inpatients with TMPs were divided into two groups according to the manner of tympanic membrane repair: one group received ETPM without raising the meatal flap, and the other received ETT. The operation duration, postoperative healing rate, visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, and complication rates were compared between these two groups.
   Results: Regardless of the size and location of the perforation, and its relationship with the malleus manubrium, myringoplasty can be completed using the ETPM method. The operation duration for different types of TMPs was shorter in the ETPM group than in the ETT group, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). However, there was no statistical difference in the short-term healing rate (p>0.05) and pain VAS score (p>0.05) between these two groups. Furthermore, no intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred in both groups.
   Conclusion: ETPM without raising the meatal flap can be applied for all types of TMPs, regardless of how large the perforation is, or where it is located. This can shorten the operation duration, and has a high healing rate comparable to ETT and mild postoperative pain. Mastering some essential surgical skills under the endoscope would be helpful to ensure the success of the surgery.

AB  - Introduction: Otitis media is an important and a highly prevalent disease of the middle ear and poses serious health problem world-wide especially in developing countries where large percentage of the population lacks specialized medical care. With a large number of patients frequently undergoing tympanoplasty for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM), it is important to assess the severity of the disease and predict the outcome of the surgical management. Aims and Objectives: To study the efficiency of MERI in predicting the outcome of tympanoplasty in all age-groups. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was carried out in the department of Ear Nose and Throat (ENT), Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Varanasi, where all cases of chronic suppurative otitis media in the age-group of 8-40 years were included from September, 2017 to December, 2018. Total 74 patients with unilateral or bilateral perforation of tympanic membrane were included and these were followed-up for 4 months after surgery. Results: Maximum cases fell under MERI 1-3 (mild disease) and these patients had the best prognosis after tympanoplasty. Patients with unilateral perforation had better success rate as compared to patients with bilateral perforation. Conclusion: Our study showed that myringoplasty is a good treatment modality in the paediatric population and MERI scoring can be useful in predicting the outcome of tympanoplasty in all age-groups.

AB  - The value of high-resolution CT scanning in diagnosing stapedial otosclerosis and in influencing surgical planning was studied. 40 cases, consisting of patients of both genders, above the age of 14 years, with a clinical diagnosis of otosclerosis underwent HRCT of the temporal bones. Images were acquired in axial plane, with a bone algorithm, keeping slice thickness at 0.5 mm and intervals of 0.5 mm. Reconstruction of the volume data set was done to obtain overlapping slices in various planes, so as to obtain the best possible images of the footplate of stapes. The thickness of the footplate was measured and the site of lesion was noted in these images. On exploratory tympanotomy, the footplate was assessed and graded according to a visual scale. HRCT was able to diagnose stapedial otosclerosis in 85% ears. It was able to identify the presence of a thickened footplate correctly with a sensitivity of 85.3% (P value 0.16). It was able to correctly localize the site of otosclerotic focus in 85% cases (P value\0.01). Thus, an estimate of the thickness of the footplate likely to be encountered and thus the amount of drilling likely to be required to create a fenestra; and the likely site of maximum thickness could be made preoperatively. This study also established the value of multislice CT on the acquisition of such data. This method obviates the requirement of difficult patient positioning, reduces scanning time; while greatly improving the sensitivity of the scanning.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Previous reports have shown that DWI is useful in detecting cholesteatoma. SS-EPI is the most widely used DWI technique. However, SS-EPI may have susceptibility artifacts due to field inhomogeneity in the imaging of the temporal bone region. Our purpose was to prospectively evaluate the advantage of MS-EPI for the diagnosis of middle ear cholesteatoma by comparing it with SS-EPI.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 29 patients with preoperatively suspected acquired cholesteatoma. Each patient underwent an MR imaging examination including both SS-EPI and MS-EPI by using a 1.5T MR imaging scanner. Images of the 29 patients (58 temporal bones including 30 with and 28 without cholesteatoma) were reviewed by 2 independent neuroradiologists. The confidence level for the presence of cholesteatoma was graded on a scale of 0-2 (0 = none, 1 = equivocal, 2 = definite). Interobserver agreement as well as sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were assessed for the 2 readers.
   RESULTS: Excellent interobserver agreement was shown for both MS-EPI (kappa = 0.8561 and SS-EPI (kappa = 0.820). MS-EPI was associated with higher sensitivity (76.7%) and accuracy (87.9%) than SS-EPI (sensitivity = 50.0%, accuracy = 74.1%) (P < .05), while both methods showed 100% specificity.
   CONCLUSIONS: Compared with SS-EPI, MS-EPI improves the accuracy of the diagnosis of acquired middle ear cholesteatomas.

AB  - Purpose To investigate how the anatomical configuration of the oval window region (OWR) influences the management of the chorda tympani (ChT) and the curetting of adjacent bony structures, in a setting of patients undergoing endoscopic stapes surgery (EStS); to assess the incidence of early and late post-operative dysgeusia and to identify anatomical and surgical factors influencing taste function after EStS. Methods Surgical video recordings of 48 patients undergoing EStS for otosclerosis between January 2019 and July 2020 were retrospectively revised, to classify the anatomical variability of selected middle ear structures and the management strategies for the ChT. Clinical records of included patients were reviewed for subjective early and late post-operative taste impairment using a 5-point Likert-scale. Results The most common configuration of the OWR was type III. The extension of the bony curettage resulted inversely proportional to the exposure of the OWR. The long-term rate of preserved post-operative taste function was 85%. Displacement of the ChT was necessary in 43/48 cases (90%), mostly medially (36/48, 75%). Conclusion Bone curetting during EStS does not correlate with post-operative taste impairment. Despite 100% ChT preservation rate, dysgeusia may occur in a minority of patients, with no apparent relationship to anatomical variability or intraoperative management of the ChT. The use of CO2 laser could have a role in increasing the risk of post-operative dysgeusia after EStS.

AB  - Objective: Our aim is to evaluate the effect of nasal septal deviation on the middle ear pressure and Eustachian Tube (ET) functions with regard to the side of deviation.
   Methods: A prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted. Overall, 50 patients (22 female, 28 male) undergoing septoplasty because of nasal septum deviation were included. The nasal obstruction symptom evaluation (NOSE) scale was used to evaluate surgical satisfaction. Middle ear ventilation and the ET functions of a total of 100 ears were assessed with basal tympanometry and insufflation tests (Valsalva and Toynbee). The tests were performed on the operation day and eight weeks after surgery. The ears were divided into two groups: the affected side (the side of nasal obstruction) (Group 1) and the contralateral side (Group 2). The study parameters obtained before and after septoplasty were compared.
   Results: The NOSE scores decreased after septoplasty (12.48 +/- 4.78/7.56 +/- 3.4) (p<0.001). There were 20 functional ETs (40%) in the affected side preoperatively, which increased to 36 ears (72%) postoperatively, and functional tubes increased to 35 (70%) from 29 (58%) after surgery in the contralateral side. The changes in the tympanometry results were statistically significant for both the affected side (-33.56 daPA/-21.18 daPA) and contralateral side (29.24daPA/-24.96daPA) (p<0.05), but the alteration in the side of deviation was more evident.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that septoplasty may have a beneficial effect on middle ear ventilation and ET functions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to compare the postoperative morbidity and cosmetic results between the use of the scapha and the use of the tragus as the auricular cartilage graft donor site in patients who had undergone cartilage tympanoplasty. The fascia graft was used as the control.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: The patient's visual symmetry, cosmetic satisfaction, and anthropometric measurements were studied to objectively evaluate the cosmetic condition. The formation of skin scar changes, pigmentation changes, and sensory changes as clinical criteria were compared.
   RESULTS: A total of 234 patients and their 257 operated ears were included in the study. Forty prospectively operated ears with preoperative findings were also included. All patients (100%) felt that their results were good, as indicated by the visual analog scale, and the anthropometric ear measurements used to reinforce the data showed no significant differences between the groups. A significant difference with respect to clinical sensory changes was found between the groups only in patients undergoing unilateral surgery via the retro auricular approach (p<0.05). There was no difference between the scapha and tragus groups with respect to scar formation or skin pigmentation change.
   CONCLUSION: Neither scapha nor tragus use for graft retrieval led to dissatisfaction or cosmetic problems in the postoperative period. Sensory changes in the skin on clinical evaluation were less common in patients in whom the scapha donor site was preferred than in cases in which the tragus was used.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the concept of bilateral same day tympanoplasty type I (BSDT) in accordance with the principle of evidence based medicine.
   Methods: A study with control was carried out in a tertiary care setting in a sample size of 60 patients suffering from chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The patients were divided into two groups of 30 patients each, group-A comprised of unilateral CSOM cases and group-B comprised of bilateral CSOM cases. All the patients underwent tympanoplasty type I by post auricular inlay technique using temporalis fascia graft. BSDT was done in group-B. Graft and audiological success rates were tabulated and put to statistical examination Using Student's T test. In addition, post-operative pain was measured by visual analogue scale and statistically analyzed.
   Results: A graft uptake of 90% and 93% was recorded in group-A and B, respectively. 27 (90%) patients reported an air-bone gap of less than 20 dB post-operatively in group-A and 94% (56 of the operated 60 ears) had an air bone gap less than 20 dB post-operatively in group-B. No case of iatrogenic sensorinueral hearing loss was recorded in this study. Further, pain was not found to be a statistically significant factor detrimental to BSDT.
   Conclusion: Bilateral same day tympanoplasty type I is a feasible treatment option in modern otology for a specific group of patients suffering from CSOM.(C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of ultrasound guided superficial cervical plexus (SCP) block versus greater auricular nerve (GAN) block for on postoperative tympanomastoid surgery analgesia.
   Methods: In this prospective, randomized, single-blind study, a total of 50 patients aged between 25 and 70 years, those who were in the American Society of Anesthesiologists I-II class and underwent tympanomastoid surgery were included in the study. Patients were randomized to either Group Y: intravenous patient-controlled analgesia tramadol (IV PCA) + SCP block; , n=25 and Group G: IV PCA + GAN block; n=25. Postoperative pain was evaluated at the 2nd, 6th 12nd, and 24th hours using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and postoperative 6th, 12nd, and 24th hour follow-up results were evaluated to identify the quantity of tramadol use.
   Results:The VAS scores at all measures time were found to be no statistically significant difference between groups (p>0.05). The amounts of PCA tramadol consumption at all measures time were significantly lower in Group Y than in Group G (p<0.05).
   Conclusion:The results of this study have indicated that SCP and GAN blocks can be used for pain control after tympanomastoid surgery. We believe that the only disadvantage of SCP block application with lower amounts of tramadol use is that the complications that can occur are more serious than those that can occur in GAN application.

AB  - The Vibrant Soundbridge active middle ear implant can provide a reliable solution for hearing rehabilitation of patients with conductive, sensorineural or mixed hearing loss. For sensorineural hearing loss, the air conduction threshold of the patient should not be more increased than 80-85 dBHL at the range of 3-4 kHz, and for conductive and mixed hearing loss, the bone conduction threshold should not be more increased than 45-65 dBHL between 0.5 and 4 kHz. The standard surgical procedure was originally designed for purely sensorineural hearing loss, and the fixation clip of the vibrating transducer needed to be crimped onto the long process of the incus. In many cases, it is impossible to crimp the vibrator onto the incus. In order to solve such circumstances, fixation clips (couplers) have been developed. There are two options to crimp the device on the incus: applying a long process coupler or a short process coupler. For conductive or mixed hearing loss, a round window soft coupler has been introduced. In advanced otosclerotic cases, a special combined technique of Soundbridge implantation with simultaneous stapedotomy can result in sufficient hearing rehabilitation. These techniques significantly broadened the scale of possibilities for the implantation, therefore, it became a widely utilized, reliable procedure. At the Department of Otorhino-laryngology, Clinical Center, University of Pecs, in addition to a noteworthy amount of incus vibroplasty, several cases of round window vibroplasty have also been performed. The aim of the present study is to summarize the history of development of the Vibrant Soundbridge and to present an overview of the applicable surgical techniques.

AB  - Purpose This study aimed to compare the outcomes of endoscopic tympanoplasty with post-conchal perichondrium (PCP) and microscopic tympanoplasty with temporalis fascia in repairing large-sized eardrum perforations. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of 43 patients who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty for simple large-sized perforations. The patients were divided into two groups: Group I (endoscopic ear surgery with a PCP graft, 22 patients) and Group II (microscopic ear surgery with temporalis fascia, 21 patients). Graft success rate, demographic data, pre- and postoperative pure-tone average and word-recognition score, closure of the air - bone gap, and postoperative pain scale scores were compared between the two groups. Results The graft success rates in groups I and II were 86.3% and 85.7%, respectively. The mean operation time in Group I (79.8 +/- 16.5 min) was significantly shorter than that in Group II (99.9 +/- 26.7 min) (p = 0.006). Both groups showed significant improvements in the pure-tone average and word-recognition scores. Average closure of the air - bone gap (ABG) in groups I and II was 20.7 +/- 6.9 dB and 17.6 +/- 8.4 dB, respectively. The reduction in ABG in Group I had a significantly higher magnitude than in Group II at 1000 and 2000 Hz, respectively (p = 0.028 and p = 0.017). The two groups showed no significant difference in postoperative pain scores. Conclusion Endoscopic tympanoplasty with PCP showed a reliable, fascia-preserved, and excellent outcome in repairing large-sized perforations.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the association between mucociliary function of the Eustachian tube using the Saccharin test preoperatively and its correlation with dynamic slow-motion video endoscopy on the outcome of Type-I Tympanoplasty in patients with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media. Methodology: Eighty patients diagnosed with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media who underwent Type-I Tympanoplasty were included in the study. Preoperative assessment of Eustachian tube function was conducted using the Saccharin test. Results of this test were categorized as normal, partial, or gross dysfunction. Dynamic slow-motion video endoscopy was performed to assess motion and pathological factors of the Eustachian tube. Results were evaluated based on a previously validated Visual Analogue Score (VAS). Patients were followed up postoperatively for 3 months. Results: The proportion of patients with surgical failure at the end of the 1st and 3rd month postoperatively was significantly higher in cases of gross Eustachian tube dysfunction compared to those with normal and partial dysfunction (p-value < 0.0001 and p-value = 0.0001, respectively). Preoperative VAS scores in normal Eustachian tubes were significantly higher compared to those with partial dysfunction and gross dysfunction. Conclusion: The Saccharin test is a valuable tool for preoperative evaluation of mucociliary clearance of the Eustachian tube, and dynamic slow-motion video endoscopy serves as a useful adjunct in predicting the outcome of Type-I Tympanoplasty. Routine evaluation of mucociliary clearance function of the Eustachian tube should be included in the preoperative workup for patients undergoing Tympanoplasty to achieve optimal surgical outcomes.

AB  - PurposeProgressive adherent pars tensa occasionally induces ossicular erosion. Specifically, stapes discontinuity adversely affects postoperative hearing. However, this irretrievable sequela is challenging to prove preoperatively, partly because perimatrix inflammation on the pars tensa can obscure the visibility of the ossicles or the partial volume effect of computed tomography (CT) imaging can hamper detailed ossicular visualization. Therefore, there is no consensus regarding the ideal timing for switching from a wait-and-see approach to a surgical one. Herein, we aimed to explore the potential predictors of stapes superstructure destruction in adherent pars tensa.MethodsThis retrospective cohort study enrolled consecutive patients who underwent primary tympanoplasty for adherent pars tensa categorized as grade IV on Sade's grading scale between April 2016 and September 2021. The impact of features on otoscopy and CT and air-bone gap (ABG) on stapes superstructure destruction was assessed using uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses.ResultsSixty-four ears were included. Multivariate analysis revealed the presence of debris on the adherent pars tensa (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}]): 4.799 [1.063-21.668], p = 0.0415), presence of soft-tissue density occupying the oval window (OR [95% CI]: 13.876 [3.084-62.437], p = 0.0006), and a >= 20-dB preoperative ABG at 3 kHz (OR [95% CI]: 7.595 [1.596-36.132], p = 0.0108) as independent predictors for stapes superstructure destruction.ConclusionHigh preoperative awareness of the possibility of destruction of the stapes superstructure would enable the surgeon to make a timely decision to provide surgical intervention before progression to severe stapes destruction, thereby maintaining long-term satisfactory hearing.

AB  - Purpose Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common in pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia, and clinicians seek prophylactic interventions to prevent its ill effects on patients as well as its ramifications on perioperative care. We sought to assess the body of evidence around prophylactic strategies, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, targeting pediatric PONV.
   Source We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE ePubs Ahead of Print and In-Process Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CENTRAL (via the Ovid platform), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, from their inception to 23 September 2022.
   Principal findings Of 188 clinical trials, 157 (83%) investigated pharmacologic interventions, 25 (13%) investigated nonpharmacologic interventions, and six (3%) investigated mixed pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. The most common surgeries investigated for pediatric PONV were strabismus surgery (68 trials, 36%) and tonsillectomy or tympanoplasty (45 trials, 23%). Of four measurement tools used to assess PONV in the included trials, the most common was clinical judgement (170 trials, 90%).
   Conclusion The majority of data in pediatric PONV prophylaxis is based on pharmacologic interventions, with a paucity of research in nonpharmacologic or mixed interventions. Assessing and documenting PONV using tools such as the Baxter Animated Retching Faces Scale or PONV numeric scoring system may help standardize pediatric PONV prophylaxis research moving forward. Furthermore, concurrently assessing pain and adverse effects associated with PONV might further inform our understanding of this complex clinical entity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess the extent of mastoid opacification after canal wall up (CWU) cholesteatoma surgery.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: Thirty-five children in whom post-operative MRI had been obtained after CWU surgery. Cholesteatoma confined to the meso-and/or epi-tympanum was removed using a transcanal approach (n=18). More extensive disease required a combined approach tympanomastoidectomy (CAT, n=17). Mastoid opacification was assessed in both ears by a neuroradiologist blind to surgical details using an ordinal scale from 0 (no opacification) to 6 (completely opacified). The primary outcome measure was presence of normal mastoid ventilation, defined by evaluation of non-operative ears as a score <= 2. The presence of normal ventilation, as well as the raw opacification scores, were compared according to type of cholesteatoma surgery: 1) transcanal, with no mastoidectomy and 2) CAT.
   RESULTS: Mastoid ventilation was normal in 18 post-operative ears (51%). There was no significant difference in the proportion of normally ventilated mastoids in the CAT (n=17) and transcanal (n=18) groups (p=0.318; Fisher's exact). However, mastoid opacification scores were significantly higher in the CAT group than in the transcanal group (p=0.036; Mann-Whitney U).
   CONCLUSION: The mastoid frequently fails to become normally ventilated after cholesteatoma surgery. Subgroup analysis suggests cortical mastoidectomy does not increase the likelihood of normal mastoid ventilation after CWU cholesteatoma surgery. MRI provides a non-invasive tool to assess mastoid function, which contributes to the current debate on optimum surgical strategies for management of the mastoid in cholesteatoma surgery. Further research will determine whether this measure of mastoid health correlates with risk of recurrent cholesteatoma.

AB  - Objective To systematically review the results of inlay cartilage butterfly tympanoplasty and standard underlay temporal fascia tympanoplasty for anatomic and functional end points. Data Sources PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Virtual Health Library (VHL/Lilacs) databases were searched from inception through April 2, 2021. No restrictions on language, publication year, or publication status were applied. Review Methods The meta-analysis included data from articles that met inclusion criteria and were extracted by 2 authors independently. The PRISMA statement was followed. Risk of Bias 2.0 and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess risk of bias. The primary outcome was tympanic membrane closure rate. The secondary outcome was improvement of the air-bone gap. Results Ten studies were included, 9 cohort studies and 1 randomized clinical trial, with 577 patients. The graft take rate was 82.8% in the butterfly cartilage inlay tympanoplasty group and 85.2% in the temporal fascia underlay tympanoplasty group (relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93-1.11; I-2 = 42%, P = .08). The air-bone gap reduction ranged from 6.1 to 11.28 in the butterfly cartilage inlay group and from 5.2 to 12.66 in the temporal fascia underlay group, with a mean difference between groups of -2.08 (95% CI, -3.23 to -0.94; I-2 = 58%, P = .04), favoring temporal fascia underlay. Conclusion The 2 tympanoplasty techniques analyzed here produced similar results in terms of successful reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and reduction in the air-bone gap. Neither age nor follow-up length of time influenced outcomes.

AB  - ObjectiveOur objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes after endoscopic and microscopic type I tympanoplasty.Study DesignRandomized controlled trials, two-arm prospective studies, and retrospective studies were included.SettingMedline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched until March 1, 2022 using the combinations of search terms: "endoscopic," "microscopic," and "tympanoplasty."MethodsTwo independent reviewers utilized the abovementioned search strategy to identify eligible studies. If any uncertainty existed regarding eligibility, a third reviewer was consulted. Primary outcome measures were graft success rate, air-bone gap (ABG) improvement, and operative time. Secondary outcomes were the rate of need for canalplasty, the proportion of self-rated excellent cosmetic results, and pain visual analog scale (VAS).ResultsForty-three studies enrolled a total of 3712 patients who were undergoing type I tympanoplasty and were finally included. The pooled result showed endoscopic approach was significantly associated with shorter operative time (difference in means: -20.021, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -31.431 to -8.611), less need for canalplasty (odds ratio [OR]: 0.065, 95% CI: 0.026-0.164), more self-rated excellent cosmetic results (OR: 87.323, 95% CI: 26.750-285.063), and lower pain VAS (difference in means: -2.513, 95% CI: -4.737 to -0.228). No significant differences in graft success rate or ABG were observed between the two procedures.ConclusionEndoscopic type I tympanoplasty provides a similar graft success rate, improvement in ABG, and reperforation rate to microscopic tympanoplasty with a shorter operative time, better self-rated cosmetic results, and less pain. Unless contraindicated, the endoscopic approach should be the procedure of choice in type I tympanoplasty.

AB  - Purpose The learning curve in endoscopic stapes surgery, is flat and long. There is limited space during training for advanced and salvage procedures, which could be necessary in unexpected intraoperative scenarios. The aim of the present study is to develop an ex-vivo animal model for training in salvage and advanced procedures in endoscopic stapes surgery Methods After defining the difficult intraoperative scenarios requiring a salvage procedure during stapes surgery, we used the ovine model to create those intraoperative situations. After assessing the suitability of the model for that purpose, it was validated by subjective feedback rating (scale from 1 to 10) and by comparing the relevant anatomical structures for stapes surgery with the human. Finally, an optimal sequence of surgical steps was defined. Results 8 Fresh frozen lamb heads (16 ears) were studied. The selected intraoperative scenarios were: floating footplate, footplate fracture, luxation of the incus or necrosis of the long process, overhanging facial nerve, obliterative otosclerosis. The simulation resulted feasible and close to real. The mean overall rating for surgical scenarios ranged from 7.5 to 8.8 for residents and was consistent with the rating of senior surgeons, ranging from 7.67 and 9.0. Anatomical measures of the oval window area resulted similar between the ovine and the human. Conclusion The ex-vivo ovine model is a suitable model for training in salvage and advanced procedures in exclusively endoscopic stapes surgery. The model can be used both for the training and maintenance of the acquired advanced skills in endoscopic stapes surgery.

AB  - Background Otosclerosis is one of the most frequent causes of conductive hearing loss in adults. Surgical treatment is considered to be the gold standard for this disease. Endoscopic stapedectomy is a new approach for the treatment of otosclerosis that requires a bloodless field. Aim of the Study To determine whether the routine use of beta blockers as a premedication can improve the operative field in endoscopic stapedectomy or not. Patients and Methods Sixty patients aged from 18 to 50 years, undergoing endoscopic stapedectomy, were included in this prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either metoprolol 100 mg ( group 1) or a placebo, vitamin tablet, (group 2) 60 min before surgery. Results The age, gender, body weight and ASA physical status were comparable between the two groups. The average blood loss in the placebo group was significantly greater than in the metoprolol group, but the time of operation in the metoprolol group was not significantly shorter. The surgical field was assessed using the Fromme-Boezaart scale, and those who received metoprolol had considerably cleaner (p0.001) surgical fields. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) didn't differ statistically significant at basal measurement up to 30 min after anesthesia induction while it was significantly lower in the metoprolol group after 30 min of induction up to end of surgery (p < 0.001). The heart rate was also significantly lower (p < 0.001) in patients who received metoprolol from prior to anesthesia induction up to end of surgery. Conclusion metoprolol significantly improves visual clarity and hemodynamics during endoscopic stapedectomy.

AB  - Objective. Endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty (ETM) has been an emerging technique for repairing tympanic perforations since the late 1990s. Objective outcomes (ie, graft success rates and hearing results) of patients who received ETM are well documented; however, subjective outcomes of these patients have rarely been reported. Hence, this study evaluated subjective and objective outcomes of patients who received ETM for repairing tympanic perforations.
   Study Design. Prospective study. Setting. Tertiary care university hospital.
   Patients and Methods. Patients who underwent ETM for perforations of the tympanic membrane were included. We evaluated subjective variables of patients receiving ETM as the primary outcome and objective variables as the secondary outcome.
   Results. In total, 91 ears that underwent ETM were included. The mean pain scale score was 0.1 (range, 0-2) on postoperative day 3. The mean duration of pain medication was 2.0 (range, 0-3) days. The mean number of days required to resume routine activities was 1.0 (range, 1-2) days. The overall graft success was determined postoperatively at 3 months in 80 of 91 ears (87.9%). Closure of the air-bone gap to within 20 dB was achieved in 79 (86.8%) ears.
   Conclusion. In this study, patients who received ETM had mild postoperative pain and resumed routine activities early. These patients also exhibited favorable graft success rates and hearing results at 3 months postoperatively. On the basis of our results, we conclude that patients who receive ETM for the repair of tympanic perforations have favorable short-term subjective and objective outcomes.

AB  - Objective Although overlay grafting for complicated tympanic perforations offers a high success rate, potential complications may outweigh its advantages. This study aimed to assess endoscopic overlay tympanoplasty (EOT), compared with microscopic overlay tympanoplasty (MOT), to optimize outcomes while minimizing complications associated with large tympanic perforations. Study Design Nonmasked, randomized. Setting Tertiary care university hospital. Subjects and Methods Altogether, 70 patients with large tympanic perforations were randomized to undergo overlay tympanoplasty between June 2014 and July 2016. Primary outcome was the visual analog scale (VAS) of pain. Secondary outcomes were anatomic closure, hearing results, middle ear findings, and postoperative complications. Results Overall, 34 EOT patients and 30 MOT patients completed the follow-up. VAS scores at 4, 24, and 48 hours in EOT and MOT groups were, respectively, 3 and 8, 1.7 and 6.0, and 0.6 and 4.1. Postoperative pain was less in the EOT group (P < .001), and canalplasty was not required (P = .003). Graft "take" rates for EOT and MOT were 97.1% and 93.3%, respectively (P = .60). Postoperative air-bone gap was lower with EOT (5.0 vs 10.3 dB) (P = .01). Various middle ear structures were more visible after EOT than after MOT (P < .001). Ear protrusion (P = .008) and postauricular numbness (P < .001) occurred after 50 MOTs. Conclusion EOT for repairing large tympanic perforations provides more favorable anatomical and audiometric outcomes. It also offers superior visibility of middle ear structures without lifting the annulus, with fewer complications and less invasiveness than MOT.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate whether dexmedetomidine has a cardioprotective effect during coronary artery bypass graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB).
   Design: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: A university hospital.
   Participants: Thirty-eight patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery.
   Interventions: Patients were randomized into 2 groups: dexmedetomidine and placebo groups. In the dexmedetomidine group, dexmedetomidine infusion was started by a loading dose of 0.5 mu g/kg/10 min, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 mu g/kg/h. The placebo group received the same volume of saline. Measurements of central venous pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure (MPAP) and cardiac index were performed before and after dexmedetomidine loading dose and 2, 24 and 48 hours after CPB. Simultaneously, arterial blood was sampled for CK-MB, cardiac troponin T, and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide.
   Measurements and Main Results: CK-MB, cardiac troponin T and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide values were elevated in the periods after CPB in both groups (p < 0.05) and there were no statistically significant differences between groups. MPAP was decreased in the dexmedetomidine group at the 2nd, 24th and 48th hour after CPB (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.002, respectively). Higher cardiac index values were seen earlier in the dexmedetomidine group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Myocardial damage was not reduced by administration of 0.5 mu g/kg loading dose and 0.5 mu g/kg/h infusion of dexmedetomidine. However MPAP tended to be lower in the dexmedetomidine group. Large-scale clinical outcome studies are indicated to confirm the effect of dexmedetomidine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - ObjectivesObliteration of the round window (RW) in cases of otosclerosis presents a significant clinical challenge due to its association with more severe hearing loss and a poorer prognosis for functional recovery after stapes surgery. The objective is to assess and characterize the occurrence of RW involvement in otosclerosis cases and to identify patterns of disease progression that may indicate a potential for RW obliteration.MethodsWe selected archival temporal bones from donors with otosclerosis. We evaluated the degree of RW obliteration using a semi-quantitative scale and the location of the foci within the temporal bone, and whether the foci were continuous or isolated.ResultsMost of the foci were located anteriorly to the oval window (89.2%), while RW area involvement was seen in 26.9% of the ears. In cases with fenestral foci, 68.1% directly involved and/or fixed the footplate. Among donors with bilateral otosclerosis, foci affected both ears in a similar pattern in 64.2%. Among donors with RW involvement, ones with continuous, large lesions that extended from the oval window associated with complete RW obliteration, while ones with smaller degrees of obliteration had solitary foci scattered within the otic capsule.ConclusionOur results demonstrate a high rate of RW involvement in cases of otosclerosis. Ears with continuous lesions extending from the oval window region to the RW area were more likely to present with complete RW obliteration. These results provide insights that could lead to better prognostic assessment of patients with otosclerosis in the future.Level of EvidenceN/A Laryngoscope, 2024

AB  - Introduction Endoscopic type I tympanoplasty (ETT) is currently accepted as an effective, minimally traumatic procedure for repairing tympanic membrane perforation. However, ETT requires tympanomeatal flap elevation which chorda tympani nerve injury, bleeding and wound healing are the drawbacks of this technique. Thus endoscopic transtympanic myringoplasty (ETM) without elevation of the tympanomeatal flap is commonly used as an alternative technique. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of ETM versus ETT for repairing medium- to large-sized perforation of the tympanic membrane. Methods The study cohort comprised patients undergoing surgery for medium- to large-sized perforation of the tympanic membrane between February 2018 and February 2019. The patients were randomized into the ETM group and the ETT group. The main outcomes were the graft take rates and hearing results. Secondary outcomes were the operative time, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, and postoperative complications. Results Forty patients who completed 6 months of follow-up were included, comprising 21 patients in the ETM group and 19 in the ETT group. The overall graft take rates for the ETM and ETT groups were 95.2% and 89.5%, respectively (P = 0.59). The graft take rates for patients in the ETM group with large-sized tympanic membrane perforation was 88.9%. There was a significantly higher rate of good hearing result in the ETM group (95.2% versus 68.4%) (P = 0.04). The ETM group had significantly shorter operative times than the ETT group (P < 0.01). Conclusion Our results demonstrated that the surgical outcome of ETM is comparable to that of ETT. However, ETM is less invasive and has a shorter operative time than ETT, and is suitable for simple perforation repair, regardless of the perforation size.

AB  - Objectives. This study aimed to compare the outcome of endoscopic and microscopic tympanoplasty.
   Methods. This was a retrospective comparative study of 73 patients (35 males and 38 females) who underwent type I tympanoplasty at Samsung Medical Center from April to December 2014. The subjects were classified into two groups; endoscopic tympanoplasty (ET, n=25), microscopic tympanoplasty (MT, n=48). Demographic data, perforation size of tympanic membrane at preoperative state, pure tone audiometric results preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively, operation time, sequential postoperative pain scale (NRS-11), and graft success rate were evaluated.
   Results. The perforation size of the tympanic membrane in ET and MT group was 25.3% +/- 11.7% and 20.1% +/- 11.9%, respectively (P=0.074). Mean operation time of MT (88.9 +/- 28.5 minutes) was longer than that of the ET (68.2 +/- 22.1 minutes) with a statistical significance (P=0.002). External auditory canal (EAC) width was shorter in the ET group than in the MT group (P = 0.011). However, EAC widening was not necessary in the ET group and was performed in 33.3% of patients in the MT group. Graft success rate in the ET and MT group were 100% and 95.8%, respectively; the values were not significantly different (P=0.304). Pre- and postoperative audiometric results including bone and air conduction thresholds and air -bone gap were not significantly different between the groups. In all groups, the postoperative air -bone gap was significantly improved compared to the preoperative air-bone gap. Immediate postoperative pain was similar between the groups. However, pain of 1 day after surgery was significantly less in the ET group.
   Conclusion. With endoscopic system, minimal invasive tympanoplasty can be possible with similar graft success rate and less pain.

AB  - Purpose: The objective of this study is to understand the outcome of minimally invasive topical anesthetized transcanal inlay and underlay tympanoplasty, and to compare these 2 procedures in hearing result, take rate, perioperative pain, and operation time.
   Materials and methods: This is a retrospective study conducted from September 2003 to December 2006. Forty-eight tympanoplasty in 46 patients, 28 inlay and 20 underlay procedures, with small- to medium-sized tympanic membrane perforations without middle ear lesion, were studied in a tertiary referral center. Interventions included otologic examination, perioperative hearing evaluation, local anesthetized transcanal inlay, or underlay tympanoplasty. The outcome measurements were the following: the take rate and audiometric result at the last follow-up visit, perioperative pain, and duration of surgery. The statistical methods used were t test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi(2) test, and Fisher exact test.
   Results: The take rate were 82.1% in the inlay group and 85% in the underlay group, without significant difference (P.79) at the last follow-up visit. Air-bone gap closure was 6.3 +/- 2.5 dB in the inlay group and 9.3 +/- 3.2 dB in the underlay (P =.07). Linear analogue scale of perioperative pain was lower in the inlay group with significance (1.7 +/- 1.2 in the inlay and 4.6 +/- 1.9 in the underlay group, P <.001). The duration of the surgery was significantly shorter in the inlay group (31.8 +/- 13.9 minutes for the inlay group and 75.9 +/- 14.6 minutes for the underlay group, P <.001).
   Conclusions: Minimally invasive topically anesthetized transcanal tympanoplasty provides satisfactory surgical and audiometric outcome both in inlay and underlay procedures. The take rate and extent of hearing recovery are similar in both groups. However, inlay tympanoplasty is superior to transcanal tympanoplasty because of less discomfort and shorter operation time.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the graft success rate and hearing outcome of modified cartilage inlay graft technique for repairing large perforations under local anesthesia. Study Design: Prospective case series. Methods and Materials: We performed a prospective study in 31 patients with large perforations who underwent endoscopic local anesthesia-based modified cartilage inlay graft technique with no raising of the squamous epithelium and no rimming of the perforation margins. The graft outcomes and complications were evaluated at 6 and 24 months postoperatively. Results: Thirty-one patients (31 ears) were included in this study. The mean operation time was 42.3 +/- 2.6 (ranged 3651) minutes. The visual analog scale pain scores at intraoperative and 2 and 48 hours postoperatively were, respectively, 2.6 +/- 0.6, 1.4 +/- 0.2, and 0.6 +/- 0.1. The graft success rate was 100.0% (31/31) at 6 months after surgery. However, only 25 (80.6%, 25/31) patients completed a 2-year follow-up and performed a temporal bone CT examination; re-perforation was seen in 2 patients, the graft success rate was 92.0% (23/25). CT revealed the well-developed pneumatization of the mastoids and middle ear in all the patients. Nevertheless, 1 (1/25, 8.0%) patient developed a graft epithelial inclusion cyst, which was removed by endoscope in the outpatient setting. The mean preoperative air bone gap (ABG) was 23.1 +/- 4.3 dB, while the mean postoperative ABG after 6 months was 14.9 +/- 2.6 dB; the difference between these values was significant (P <.05; Wilcoxon's signed-rank test), and the functional success rate was 93.5% (29/31). Conclusion: Endoscopic modified cartilage "inlay" graft technique with no raising the squamous epithelium and no rimming the perforation is a minimally invasive technique with a short operative time and satisfying success rate for closure of large perforations under local anesthesia.

AB  - Objective: To compare the effects of esmolol and remifentanil, used as adjuncts for induced hypotension on surgical conditions and short-term cognitive functions, during tympanoplasty.
   Methods: The study was conducted in Hacettepe University, School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey between January 2005 and December 2006 following Institutional Ethical Committee approval, 40 ASA I-II patients, between 18 and 60 years of age were included in this study. With the induction of anesthesia, for group E, an esmolol infusion of 50-250 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1) was titrated, following a bolus of 0.5 mg.kg(-1); for group R, a remifentanil infusion of 0.2-0.5 mu g.kg(-1).min(-1) was titrated; to achieve a mean blood pressure (BP) of 55-65 mm Hg. Arterial BP were recorded continuously throughout the operation. Mini Mental State Test (MMS) was performed at the preoperative 30th minute (MMSP), postoperative 30th minute (MMS30), 60th minute (MMS60) and 24th hour (MMS24). Surgical field was evaluated by the blinded surgeon, using a 6 point category scale.
   Results: Patient demographics were similar in both groups. Sustained controlled hypotension was sufficient in A of the groups throughout surgery. Surgical field scores were lower in group R (p<0.05), although the scores were <= 2 in both groups, which was regarded as adequate for tympanoplasty. Four patients in group R (20%) and one patient in group E (5%) showed cognitive function decline between MMSP and MMS30. Within both groups, there were statistically significant differences between MMS60 and MMSP, MMS24 and MMSP, MMS60 and MMS30, MMS24 and MMS30, but the results were similar between the groups.
   Conclusion: Remifentanil or esmolol provided adequate induced hypotension and similar operating conditions and their effects on cognitive functions in the short postoperative period are similar for tympanoplasty.

AB  - Purpose To compare the efficacy and safety of hydroxyapatite vs. bone pate as obliteration material in mastoidectomy surgery for patients with chronic suppurative otitis media and cholesteatoma. Methods This is a retrospective, multi-center, cohort study. All patients were followed up with micro-otoscopy, audiometry, and, if indicated, MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging. The following outcome parameters were analyzed: procedure safety (wound infections and complications), cholesteatoma recidivism rates (residual/recurrent), control of infection (Merchant's scale), and hearing results (pure-tone averages at 500/1000/2000/4000 Hz). Results Eighty-three cases were included: 45 obliterated with hydroxyapatite and 38 with bone pate, with a mean follow-up time of, respectively, 25 and 24 months. Wound infections were only detected in the bone pate group (4.8%) and successfully treated with oral or intravenous antibiotics and surgical drainage (p = 0.026). No other major surgical complications were observed in both groups. Cholesteatoma recidivism was observed in 15% using hydroxyapatite and 12% using bone pate (p = 0.471). Complete control of infection (Merchant 0) was achieved in 76.2% using bone pate and 86.8% using hydroxyapatite at 12 months postoperatively (p = 0.223). All patients showed good postoperative healing without complete failure to manage infection (Merchant 3). Pre- and postoperative audiometry showed significant improvement in hearing results in both groups. No significant difference between the obliteration materials was observed. Conclusions Evaluation of mastoid obliteration reveals that hydroxyapatite and bone pate are safe and effective obliteration materials, with high success rates in achieving a dry ear, low recidivism rates, and good hearing outcome, respecting the short-term limitation. In addition, our study shows that hydroxyapatite results in fewer postoperative wound infections compared to bone pate.

KW  - PERFORATIONS
AB  - Objective: For tympanoplasty, the most common grafting materials are the temporalis fascia or perichondrium; however, both require incision of the canal skin, which carries a risk of morbidity and the need for postoperative care. Inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty, by which the perforation edges are refreshed and a cartilage is inserted through the perforation without canal incision, makes the graft easy, and reduces operating and recovery time. We analyze the outcome of inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty.
   Materials and Methods: This study included 112 patients who underwent tympanoplasty from January 2011 to August 2012. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients who underwent inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty (Group I, n = 56) and patients who underwent conventional underlay tympanoplasty using the temporalis fascia (Group II, n = 56). Anatomic success was defined as an intact, repaired tympanic membrane, and functional success was defined as a significant decrease in the air-bone gap at the end of follow-up. Perioperative pain was analyzed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Surgical success, functional success, perioperative pain, and operating time were evaluated and compared.
   Results: The surgical success rate was 96.4% in Group I and 91.1% in Group II (p = 0.435). The mean air-bone gap decrease was 7.9 +/- 2.2 dB in Group I and 8.9 +/- 3.2 dB in Group II (p = 0.426). Group I showed a lower VAS score for pain (1.5 +/- 1.2) and a shorter operation time (25.6 +/- 8.5 min) compared with those of Group II (4.9 +/- 1.7, 48.6 +/- 19.5 min, respectively) (p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty is compatible with the conventional underlay technique in both anatomic and functional success rates. Its simplicity, shorter operation time, and rapid recovery time could make it an attractive surgical option.

AB  - To study the role of infiltrating 2% Lidocaine in Micro ear surgeries performed under general anaesthesia. To measure the impact of infiltration of 2% Lidocaine in post operative pain relief and per operative bleeding. A Double blinded, Prospective randomized comparative study was conducted in a tertiary care referral centre. A total of 30 patients planned for micro ear surgeries under general anaesthesia (Tympanoplasty and Cortical mastoidectomy) for CSOM tubotympanic disease were selected and divided into two groups randomly by the chief senior consultant. Group A patients received local infiltration of 2% Lidocaine with one in 200,000 adrenaline and Group B patients received infiltration of one in 200,000 adrenaline in distilled water alone. Operating surgeon assessed the bleeding in the surgical field using Boezaart's grading system. Post operative pain was assessed using a visual analog scale. Pain scores of these patients were assessed in the 1st, 4 and 24th h post operatively and recorded. The mean post operative pain score in the 1st h for the patients in Group A was 0.93 and for patients in Group B was two. The difference in the pain scores between the two groups was significant (P < 0.02).The difference in the mean post operative pain scores between the two groups in the 4 and 24th h were not significant (P < 0.1).Per operatively, grade III bleeding was present in 73% of patients in group B and only 33% of patients had grade III bleeding in group A. Infiltration of 2% Lidocaine has a significant impact over the grade of bleeding in the operative field and also on 1st h post operative pain relief. It did not have a significant influence on the pain relief in the 4 and 24th h post operatively.

AB  - Background
   For patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery, intranasal injection of epinephrine can cause acute increases in heart rate and blood pressure.
   Objective
   Among the drugs for reducing hyperdynamic effects, dexmedetomidine and remifentanil are expected to blunt the acute hemodynamic responses after intranasal injection of epinephrine. Our study compared a difference in the 2 drugs in their abilities to blunt the hemodynamic responses in intraoperative period and postoperative profile.
   Methods
   In this study, the patients were randomly divided into the dexmedetomidine and remifentanil groups. During the intraoperative period, the hemodynamic values were recorded. The surgical condition was assessed by a single surgeon. During the postoperative period, hemodynamic values, sedation scale score, and pain score were recorded.
   Result
   No significant differences in hemodynamic variables were found between the groups before and after intranasal injection of epinephrine. Comparison of the group mean values before endotracheal intubation revealed that the blood pressure values in the remifentanil group were significantly lower than those in the dexmedetomidine group. At 2 minutes after endotracheal intubation, blood pressure and heart rate values in the remifentanil group were significantly lower than those in the dexmedetomidine group. The sedation score was significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group on arrival and at 30 minutes after arrival at the postanesthetic care unit (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). At 30 and 60 minutes after the operation, the pain scores were significantly lower in the dexmedetomidine group (P = .015 and P = .001, respectively).
   Conclusion
   Dexmedetomidine had better postoperative sedative and analgesic effects than remifentanil for patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery in this study. Remifentanil and dexmedetomidine attenuated acute hemodynamic responses to be within normal ranges after intranasal injection of epinephrine, and no significant differences in terms of hemodynamic variables. Remifentanil was superior to dexmedetomidine in inducing hypotension during endotracheal intubation.

AB  - ObjectiveTo explore the historical evolution of surgical techniques for otosclerosis treatment, viewed through the lens of human temporal bone pathology to aid in understanding the disease and refining surgical interventions.Data sourcesA review of historical literature on otosclerosis, surgical techniques, and otopathological findings was conducted. Eight temporal bone specimens from the Paparella Otopathology & Pathogenesis Laboratory, University of Minnesota, and one from the University of California, Los Angeles, were analyzed.Review methodsWe selected two temporal bones from donors who underwent four different types of surgical procedures for otosclerosis: stapes mobilization, fenestration, stapedectomy, and stapedotomy. One successful and one complication case was selected for each procedure. Histopathological analysis was performed to assess the outcomes and complications associated with each technique.ResultsThe study chronicles the progression of otosclerosis surgery from the stapes mobilization to modern stapedectomy and stapedotomy techniques. Initial procedures, like stapes mobilization and fenestration, yielded limited and temporary results with significant complications. The introduction of stapedectomy marked a significant improvement, with better long-term outcomes. Histopathological analysis revealed insights into the causes of surgical failures and complications.ConclusionOtosclerosis surgery has evolved significantly, driven by advances in otopathology and surgical technology. While earlier techniques offered limited success, modern procedures like stapedectomy and stapedotomy provide improved outcomes and fewer complications. Ongoing research promises further advancements in the field, improving patient care and surgical efficacy.Level of evidenceNA.

AB  - Otosclerosis is a bone remodeling disorder with still unclear origin, which exclusively forms tiny foci in the human temporal bone. These foci most often develop in the anterior part of the oval window niche and in the stapes footplate, and mechanically fix the ossicles, causing a consequent conductive hearing loss. In relation to the treatment of otosclerosis, it is a natural demand to try to reverse the progression of the disease with various medical treatment options, but until now only bone remodeling has been slowed down. Sodium fluoride and bisphosphonate treatment have shown to be highly promising, but due to their serious side effects, they can only be considered in exceptional cases. There is still great hope for targeted (biological) therapies, but they are not yet approved in Hungary. The ,,gold standard" procedure for otosclerosis is the surgical solution, which does not cure the disease, just simply eliminates the conductive component of the hearing loss. The older stapedectomy is increasingly being replaced by the technically simpler stapedotomy, however, they are still considered almost equivalent procedures in the literature. In addition to standard microscopic stapes surgery, the most modern endoscopic stapedotomy is also presented.

AB  - BackgroundWithin otologic surgery, a paucity of well-controlled studies assessing the use of systemic antibiotic to reduce surgical site infections exists. Moreover, discrepancies in wound classification of procedures challenge consensus in antimicrobial prescribing patterns. We sought to compare surgeons from two different health systems to examine how surgeons' prescribing habits compared to practice guidelines for numerous otologic procedures.MethodsAn online questionnaire was distributed to 33 Canadian and 32 Austrian surgeons who regularly perform otologic surgery. Current systemic antibiotic prescribing habits for cochlear implantation, cholesteatoma surgery, stapes surgery, and tympanoplasty +/- ossiculoplasty were collected.ResultsEighteen of 33 (54.5%) Canadian surgeons provided responses, while 18 of 32 (56.3%) of Austrian surgeons answered. Clear consistency with clinical practice guidelines exists for pre-operative antibiotics use in cochlear implant surgery and infected cholesteatoma surgery. However, for stapes surgery and tympanoplasty +/- ossiculoplasty, consensus is lacking for both pre- and post-operative antibiotic prescribing habits. Notable differences between the two countries include post-operative antibiotics for cochlear implant surgery (Austria: 36.4%, Canada: 71.4%) and uninfected cholesteatoma surgery (Austria: 33.3%, Canada: 77.8%). Across all procedures, both induction and post-operative antibiotic administration was not significantly associated with surgeon seniority when stratified by five-year increments.ConclusionThe lack of consensus among each country's otologic surgeons underscores the uncertainty in wound classification and thus, adherence to clinical practice guidelines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Variations along the facial nerve (FN) course present considerable challenges in the surgical treatment of otosclerosis, often complicating the procedure. Existing knowledge of its tympanic tract and its implications primarily comes from microscopical procedures. This study aims to assess endoscopic findings of FN anatomy in a healthy tympanic cavity and its impact on the stapedotomy procedure, focusing on the risk of complications and functional hearing outcomes.
   METHODS: A retrospective study on exclusive endoscopic stapedotoplasties between October 2014 and October 2021 atour Otorhinolaryngology University Department was carried out. An evaluation of intraoperative endoscopic findings reviewed in surgical descriptive and/or video records was conducted to assess their potential negative impact on the surgery. Demographic data, preoperative and postoperative hearing thresholds, as well as intraoperative and postoperative complications were analyzed.
   RESULTS: One hundred fifty-seven subjects were included. A FN partially overhanging the oval window was observed in 7.3% (n = 12): 10 prolapsing with bony canal dehiscence and 2 without any detected dehiscence. Each procedure was successfully completed without any issues related to the anomalous anatomy, and in no case, switching to the microscope for the handling of the prosthesis near the dehiscent nerve was required. No facial paralysis occurred, with an early- or long-term postoperative House-Brackman grade of 1 (n = 157, 100%). Only 3/157 patients (1.9%) showed a sensorineural threshold reduction of >= 20 dB HL, but a significant air-bone gap improvement was observed (mean closure of 18.36 dB HL, P <.0001).
   CONCLUSION: The endoscope promotes a concrete description of tympanic FN anatomy, and endoscopic stapes surgery appears to be a safe and viable option when dehiscent or prolapsed FNs reduce the footplate's exposure.

AB  - Our study aims to illustrate the clinical picture of otosclerosis in patients and the effect of surgery on the bone conduction thresholds compared to audiometry tests before surgery. A retrospective study included 36 patients that fit the inclusion criteria based on the patient's files and Pure Tone Audiometry of the patients before and after surgery. The questionnaire used is attached at the end of the study. According to Our sample, 77.8% were females, and 22.2% were males. The youngest was 17 years old, the eldest was 61, and the mean age was 38.2 years old. Hearing loss was the most common symptom in 100% of patients, while tinnitus was found in 66.7% and vertigo in 11%. The Injury was bilateral in 72% of the cases. Before surgery, the mean air conduction threshold (ACT) was 54.7 dB, the mean value of the air-bone gap (ABG) was 38.3 dB, and the mean bone conduction threshold (BCT) was 16.1 dB. Meanwhile, after the surgery, the mean BCT was 18.2 dB. Otosclerosis is more common in middle-aged females. Most cases are bilateral. Two-thirds of the cases of hearing loss were associated with tinnitus, while only a few had vertigo. A slight increase was noticed in BCTs after surgeries, especially at 4000 Hz. Stapedectomy caused a noticeable decrease in the values of BCTs on the frequency 4000 Hz. Stapedotomy improved the BCTs after surgery by about 5.3 dB at 4000 Hz.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of a caprine model in endoscopic ear surgical education using the index procedures of tympanoplasty and ossiculoplasty. Specifically, this study assessed the face and content validity of the caprine model, and the potential impact of anatomical differences on trainee understanding of human middle ear anatomy.
   METHODS: Twelve otolaryngology trainees attended a 3-hour endoscopic ear surgery course utilizing the caprine model in which they completed canalplasty, tympanoplasty, and ossiculoplasty. Prior to the course, the trainees completed a self-reported needs assessment and knowledge assessment of human middle ear anatomy. Following the course, the trainees repeated the knowledge assessment and completed evaluation and validation questionnaires. Five-point Likert scores were used for the needs assessment and validation questionnaire.
   RESULTS: Of the 12 trainees, 9 participated in the study. All domains of the learner needs assessment showed an average improvement of 1 point on the post-course evaluation with 6 of 9 domains being significantly improved using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P <.05). The model achieved validation in the domains of face, content, and global content validity with an average Likert score > 4. Knowledge assessment scores increased by 7% (P =.23) after the course compared to before.
   CONCLUSION: The caprine model offers an effective surgical simulation model for endoscopic ear surgery training with good face and content validity. We find it to be readily available and affordable. We currently use it routinely to give otolaryngology residents the experience of endoscopic ear surgery before operating on patients.

AB  - Objective This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques in predicting air-bone gap after tympanoplasty compared with conventional scoring models and to identify the influential factors. Methods We reviewed the charts of 105 patients (114 ears) with chronic otitis media who underwent tympanoplasty. Two numerical scoring systems (middle ear risk index [MERI] and ossiculoplasty outcome parameter staging [OOPS]) and three algorithms (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], and k nearest neighbor [kNN]) were created. Experimental variables included age, preoperative air-bone gap, soft-tissue density lesion in the tympanic cavity in CT, otorrhea, surgical history, ossicular bone problems in CT, tympanic perforation location, perforation type (central or marginal), grafting material, smoking history, endoscopy use, and the operator whose experience was 20 years or longer, or shorter. Binary classification, postoperative air-bone gap <= 15 or >15 dB, and multiclass classification, classification into seven categories by 10 dB, were performed, and the percentages of correct prediction were calculated. The importance of features in the RF model was calculated to identify influential factors. Results The percentages of correct prediction in binary classification were 62.3%, 72.8%, 81.5%, 81.5%, and 81.5% in MERI, OOPS, RF, SVM, and kNN, respectively, and those in multiclass classification were 29.8%, 21.9%, 63.1%, 44.7%, and 50% in the same order. The RF model suggested larger preoperative air-bone gap, and older age could make the postoperative air-bone gap larger. Conclusion The machine learning techniques, especially the RF model, are promising methods for precise postoperative air-bone gap prediction. Level of Evidence 4 Laryngoscope, 2022

AB  - Objective: Congenital defects/diseasesBackground: This paper presents a case of a 15-year-old child with a rare congenital anomaly of the middle ear in which the stapes was fused to the medial wall of the tympanic cavity.Case Report: This defect coexisted with partial malleus fixation in the attic and caused conductive hearing loss at an aver-age level of 35-40 dB. Two exploratory tympanotomies were performed, where excess bone between the sta -pes and promontory was removed and the head of the malleus was released in the attic. The good effect of these procedures was unstable, mainly due to re-attachment of the stapes to the medial wall of the tympan-ic cavity. At the next surgery it was decided to perform stapedotomy, despite the mobile stapes footplate. The operation was performed with a small-fenestra stapedotomy technique. Perforation of the footplate was done using a microdrill with a balanced speed. A KURZ prosthesis with a diameter of 0.5 mm was used. The postop-erative period passed without any complications. Three and 6 months after the surgery, control pure tone au-diometry was performed and showed significant improvement in hearing thresholds. During the follow-up pe-riod of more than 6 months, hearing improvement remained stable.Conclusions: We concluded that it was safe to perform stapedotomy in the presence of a mobile stapes footplate when con-genital anomaly of the stapes superstructure caused its severe fixation in the middle ear. In our opinion, in a child with congenital ear anomaly, consideration should be given to the multifocal origin of the hearing loss.

AB  - Purpose There have been considerable advancements in cochlear implants in different clinical scenarios; however, their use in patients with otosclerosis remains challenging. This review aimed to investigate the surgical and clinical outcomes of cochlear implantation in patients with otosclerosis. Methods An electronic literature search was performed using four main databases through February 2021 to identify original studies of cochlear implantation in patients with otosclerosis for inclusion in this systematic review. The study protocol was registered with the Prospectively Registered Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (reference number: CRD42021234753). Results A total of 23 studies including 3162 patients were enrolled. Of these patients, only 392 had otosclerosis and underwent cochlear implantation. The duration of deafness was reported in only eight studies, extending up to 50 years. Far-advanced otosclerosis was observed in 153 patients. A total of 56 patients used hearing aids. Stapedectomy and stapedotomy were performed in 118 and 63 patients, respectively. In three studies, the temporary success of stapedectomy and stapedotomy was 6 (43%) and 5 (71%) patients, respectively. Computed tomography was used as a preoperative assessment tool in most studies (n = 14, 60.9%). Incomplete implant insertion occurred in 17 patients, while facial nerve stimulation occurred in 36 patients after implantation. Conclusion Cochlear implantation is a relatively safe modality that can provide promising audiological outcomes in patients with otosclerosis. However, several factors, including cochlear ossification, duration of deafness, and previous operations, can affect its outcomes. Further studies with a larger sample population are recommended.

AB  - Background: During repair of central perforations of tympanic membrane, annulus should be visible in a single view. It helps in better placement of graft. To attain this, the bony canal is enlarged. Materials and Methods: Eighty patients with dry central perforation were selected during the period 2010u2020. Sixty patients with dry central perforation underwent tympanoplasty Type 1 with canalplasty and twenty patients were subjected to tympanoplasty Type 1 only. The method, operative procedure, and words of wisdom to give good results and prevent complications are described. Results: Patients with canalplasty had better postoperative results, and the success rate is improved as compared to only myringoplasty. The primary outcome measure of canalplasty with tympanoplasty procedure is complete re-epithelization and provision of a dry ear in 95%, whereas the final outcome without canalplasty was 90%. Conclusion: The aim of the canalplasty is to create a wide, patent, and physiological bony ear canal. Canalplasty helps to have better visualization, better postoperative care, better exposure for ossiculoplasty, time gain during graft placement, prevent lateralization, and promotes healing. It does improve the surgical outcome in tympanoplasty Type I.

AB  - Background The opioid epidemic is a significant public health crisis challenging the lives of North Americans. Interestingly, this problem does not exist to the same extent in Europe. Surgeons play a significant role in prescribing opioids, especially in the context of post-operative pain management. The aim of this study was to compare the post-surgical prescribing patterns of otologists comparing Canada and Austria. Methods An online questionnaire was sent to 33 Canadian and 32 Austrian surgeons, who perform otologic surgery on a regular basis. Surgeons were asked to answer some questions about their background as well as typical prescribing patterns for postoperative pain medication for different ear surgeries (cochlear implant, stapedotomy, tympanoplasty). In addition, surgeons were asked about the typical use of local anesthetics for pain control at the end of a procedure. Otologists gave an estimate how confident they were that their therapy and prescriptions provide sufficient pain control to their patients. Results Analysis of the returned questionnaires showed that opioids are more commonly prescribed in Canada than in Austria. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used for postoperative pain more regularly after ear surgery in Austria, as opposed to Canada. Some of the prescribed drugs by European otologists are not available in North America. The use of local anesthetics at the end of surgery is not common in Austria. Surgeons ' confidence that the prescribed pain medication was sufficient to control postoperative symptoms was higher in the group not prescribing opioids than in the group that did routinely prescribe opioids. Conclusion Prescribing patterns differ substantially between the two evaluated countries. This data suggests an opportunity to reduce opioid prescriptions after otologic surgeries. Studies to evaluate pain after these operations as well as efficacy of analgesics following ear surgery are an important next step.

AB  - Background Eighteen patients underwent simultaneous bilateral stapes surgery in 2003-2006. Objectives We evaluated the long-term outcomes in this patient group, and assessed their hearing in noise and binaural hearing. Material and Methods Fifteen patients returned questionnaires concerning their hearing, taste function, and balance. Thirteen patients underwent pure-tone and speech audiogram, Finnish matrix sentence test, video head impulse test, and clinical examination on average 13 years after surgery. Results We found no significant difference in air- and bone conduction pure-tone average, speech audiometry, and the air-bone gap between the 1-year and the late postoperative visits. One patient had bilaterally a partial loss of the vestibulo-ocular reflex of unknown cause. Conclusions and Significance The hearing results 13 years after simultaneous bilateral stapes surgery remained good without any significant delayed complications. Simultaneous bilateral stapes surgery is a viable treatment option in selected patients with otosclerosis.

AB  - Objective Comparing the feasibility of ovine and synthetic temporal bones for simulating endoscopic ear surgery against the 'gold standard' of human cadaveric tissue. Methods A total of 10 candidates (5 trainees and 5 experts) performed endoscopic tympanoplasty on 3 models: Pettigrew temporal bones, ovine temporal bones and cadaveric temporal bones. Candidates completed a questionnaire assessing the face validity, global content validity and task-specific content validity of each model. Results Regarding ovine temporal bone validity, the median values were 4 (interquartile range = 4-4) for face validity, 4 (interquartile range = 4-4) for global content validity and 4 (interquartile range = 4-4) for task-specific content validity. For the Pettigrew temporal bone, the median values were 3.5 (interquartile range = 2.25-4) for face validity, 3 (interquartile range = 2.75-3) for global content validity and 3 (interquartile range = 2.5-3) for task-specific content validity. The ovine temporal bone was considered significantly superior to the Pettigrew temporal bone for the majority of validity categories assessed. Conclusion Tympanoplasty is feasible in both the ovine temporal bone and the Pettigrew temporal bone. However, the ovine model was a significantly more realistic simulation tool.

AB  - Objective: We aim to investigate hearing sensitivity and wideband tympanometry results in bone cement ossiculoplasty cases in present study.
   Study design: A prospective study.
   Setting: Ossiculoplasty patients were grouped according to the anatomical location of bone cement application by surgery note. Ossiculoplasty and tympanoplasty patients were retrospectively invited to the clinic and evaluated. 30 bone cement ossiculoplasty cases as well as 30 Type I tympanoplasty cases (intact ossicular chain) and 30 healthy controls were included in the study and Wideband Tympanometry was performed. Tympanometric peak pressure, equivalent middle ear volume, static admittance, tympanogram width, resonance frequency, average wideband tympanometry and absorbance measurements were analyzed.
   Results: A statistically significant improvement was observed in the hearing levels of all ossiculoplasty and type I tympanoplasty patients (p < 0.05). Bone cement ossiculoplasty groups demonstrated the remarkable differences than the type I tympanoplasty and control group in Wideband Tympanometry test parameters. In some parameters, malleus-stapes and manubriostapedioplasty groups demonstrated similarities to Type I tympanoplasty and control groups.
   Conclusion: Bone cement is an effective application for ossiculoplasty. Wideband tympanometry is a promising method for the evaluation of the middle ear dynamics.

AB  - Objectives: Otosclerosis is a progressive disease of the bony labyrinth characterised by bone formation, which can cause conductive, mixed and, rarely, sensorineural hearing loss. Surgery on the stapes footplate can be successful for treating conductive hearing loss. However, complaints of new issues after surgery may prompt revision surgery. This report presents the results of revision stapes surgeries.
   Methodology: Study population consisted of patients who had undergone revision stapes surgery. Indications, findings during surgery, and preoperative and post-operative audiological data were recorded. Success rates of the surgeries were evaluated statistically.
   Results: Total of 105 cases was included in this study, and the major indication for surgery was hearing loss. Mean preoperative hearing threshold of the patients was 57.1 dB and the mean air-bone gap (ABG) was 27.4 dB; the respective postoperative values were 49.7 and 19.2 dB, respectively (p<0.05). Most common intraoperative pathologies were prosthesis-related problems and fibrotic bands/adhesion in the middle ear.
   Conclusions: Revision stapes surgery can yield successful results, especially with regard to persistent or late-onset conductive hearing loss. Likelihood of hearing gain may be decreased after repeated surgeries.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Otosclerosis is one of the commonest causes of non-suppurative conductive hearing loss. Small fenestra stapedotomy was first developed by Shea in 1962. After 50 years of first microscopic stapedotomy, endoscope-assisted stapedotomy was first described by Poe in 2000. Full endoscopic stapedotomy was performed by Joao Flavio Nogueira Junior in 2008. There are few papers on endoscopic stapedotomy, so here we are doing a study of the endoscopic stapedotomy.
   The aim of this study is to analyse whether Endoscopic Stapedotomy is safer and less traumatic.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   It is a descriptive study. There were 40 patients who underwent Endoscopic Stapedotomy for otosclerosis. Preoperative and postoperative pure tone averages and air-bone gaps were compared. Perioperative and postoperative complications were noted.
   RESULTS
   The surgeries were performed with endoscope and relevant anatomical structures were visualised without difficulty. Audiologic improvement was achieved in 37 of 40 patients. Postoperative air-bone gap was within 10 dB in 28 ears and between 10 - 20 dB in 9 ears. Unfortunately, sensorineural hearing loss was observed in 1 patient and vertigo in 5 patients.
   CONCLUSION
   Endoscopic stapes surgeries are technically feasible, safe and promising. In this series, the main advantages were virtually no trauma to the chorda tympani nerve and excellent visualisation of middle ear. The disadvantages were the lack of stereoscopic vision, having to work with one hand only and steep learning curve.

AB  - Introduction and aim: The reason of gradually developing conductive hearing loss in otosclerotic patients is the ossification of the stapes footplate to the surrounding bony structures and the therapy of stapes fixation is mainly surgical. In stapedotomy the footplate of the stapes is fenestrated with laser and microdrill in a diameter of 0.8 mm, whereas in stapedectomy there is complete removal of the footplate followed by the reconstruction of the ossicular chain. In the early postoperative period, temporary vertigo is frequently recorded which significantly influences the recovery.
   Method: In the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Pecs both stapedectomy and stapedotomy were performed on a daily basis between 01.02.2010 and 15.03.2012. Our study focused on comparing the degree of postoperative vertigo after the two types of surgery. We hypothesized that the smaller fenestration of the stapes foot- plate during stapedotomy limits exposure to the inner ear reducing the severity of dizziness. Vertigo was evaluated subjectively with a retrospective questionnaire and objectively with static posturography.
   Results: On the 1st postoperative day, significantly fewer patients reported vertigo in the stapedotomy group and with significantly lower intensity. Results of the questionnaire regarding the later postoperative period showed no significant differences between the groups. Based on the analysis of the posturography test results, no significant difference was detected between the postoperative stability of the two groups. Results of the questionnaire and the posturography showed no correlation. Posturography test results did not confirm the presence of subjective vertigo.
   Conclusion: Many factors may play a role in the development of vertigo after stapes surgery, but the type of intervention does not influence it.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Comparing the endoscopic and microscopic approaches in stapes surgery, and establishing the surgical approach that allows better results in terms of visualization of the middle ear structures and aids assistant's training.
   MATERIALS and METHODS: Twenty-one residents from the first to the fifth year of training in Otolaryngology were enrolled in this prospective study. A questionnaire specifically designed to investigate the understanding of middle ear anatomy, the surgical steps, and a personal opinion about endoscopic stapes surgery was submitted to each resident.
   RESULTS: Statistical differences between the endoscopic and microscopic approaches were evident about identification of stapes and long process of the incus (p=0.03) and stapes footplate and the oval window (p=0.03). No substantial difference between the two surgical approaches emerged regarding the visualization of the tympanic membrane and the other middle ear structures (p>0.5). A substantial difference in favor of the endoscopic approach emerged regarding the identification of the hole creation in the footplate of the stapes.
   CONCLUSION: Endoscopic stapes surgery could favor an easier understanding of the surgical technique for assistants in training with little knowledge of the anatomy and surgical steps.

AB  - Introduction: The diode laser, with a wavelength of 980 nm, has promising characteristics for being used for the fenestration during stapedotomy. It is known that at this wavelength absorption in pigmented tissues is high, and absorption in water is relatively low compared with medical lasers in the infrared, making it theoretically an applicable laser for stapes surgery in patients with otosclerosis. Another important advantage is that, with respect to other lasers, this device is relatively inexpensive. Despite the potential advantages, the available literature only shows limited reports of this laser being used in stapes surgery. The present article evaluates the thermal, mechanical, and acoustic properties of the diode laser during stapes surgery.
   Methods: For the mechanical effects, high-speed imaging with a frame rate up to 4000 f/s (=250 mu s resolution) was performed in an inner ear model. For thermal effects, the high-speed Schlieren technique was used. Acoustics were recorded by a hydrophone, incorporated in the model. Pulse settings were 100 ms, 3 W, which are the same settings used during stapes surgery.
   Results: The application of the diode laser resulted in limited mechanical and thermal effects. Impulse noise was low with an average of 52 (SD, 7.8) dB (A). Before carbonization of the tip of the delivery laser, fiber enhances ablation of the footplate.
   Conclusion: The 980-nm diode laser is a useful tool for laser-assisted stapedotomy in patients with otosclerosis. Mechanical, thermal, and acoustic effects are limited and well within the safety limits.

AB  - Hypothesis: To identify the optimum and safe location histologically for drilling and fenestration on promontory inferior to the oval window in stapedectomy. The value of application of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning and multiple-planar reconstruction (MPR) for this purpose is also assessed.
   Methods: By means of histologic sections and HRCT scanning and MPR for coronal image, measurements were conducted on 3 perpendicular planes in temporal bone sections through the anterior, posterior, and midpoint of the inferior margin of the oval window, respectively.
   Results: The promontory bone inferior to the posterior portion of the oval window is thickest, which has an average thickness of about 1.1 mm. The endosteum of the basal turn here is deepest under the promontory, which has an average height of about 0.2 mm above the plane of footplate, whereas the distance between the inferior margin of the oval window and the endosteum here is no more than 0.3 mm. The coincidence rate of the measurements by HRCT and histology is up to 90.5%.
   Conclusion: Relatively safe location for bone of the promontory removal should be restricted in the posterior portion inferior to the oval window, and the burr should be lifted laterally while drilling. Preoperative HRCT scanning and MPR for coronal image would offer a valuable reference to estimate the safe area for bone of the promontory removal in stapedectomy.

AB  - Hypothesis: A high-fidelity, inexpensive middle ear simulator could be created to enhance surgical training that would be rated as having high face validity by experts.
   Background: With rapid prototyping using additive manufacturing technology (AMT), one can create high-resolution 3-dimensional replicas of the middle ear at low cost and high fidelity. Such a simulator could be of great benefit for surgical training, particularly in light of new resident training guidelines.
   Methods: AMT was used to create surgical middle ear simulator (SMS) with 2 different materials simulating bone and soft tissue. The simulator is composed of an outer box with dimensions of an average adult external auditory canal without scutum and an inner cartridge based on an otosclerosis model. The simulator was then rated by otology experts in terms of face validity and fidelity as well as their opinion on the usefulness of such a device.
   Results: Eighteen otologists from 6 tertiary academic centers rated the simulator; 83.3% agreed or highly agreed that SMS has accurate dimensions and 66.6% that it has accurate tactile feedback. When asked if performance of stapedotomy with the SMS improves with practice, 46% agreed. As to whether practicing stapedotomy with the SMS translates to improvement with live surgery, 78% agreed with this statement. Experts' average rating of the components of SMS (of possible 5) was as follows: middle ear dimensions, 3.9; malleus, 3.7; incus, 3.6; stapes, 3.6; chorda tympani, 3.7; tensor tympani, 4.1; stapedius, 3.8; facial nerve, 3.7; and promontory, 3.5. Overall, 83% found SMS to be at least "very useful" in training of novices, particularly for junior and senior residents.
   Conclusion: Most experts found the SMS to be accurate, but there was a large discrepancy in rating of individual components. Most found it to be very useful for training of novice surgeons. With these results, we are encouraged to proceed with further refinements that will strengthen the SMS as a training tool for otologic surgery.

AB  - Developments in surgical technique and, more importantly, the use of increasingly sophisticated biocompatible prostheses have meant that good results can be achieved for otosclerosis sufferers in terms of restored hearing and very little postsurgical discomfort. We set out to assess whether the diameter of the prostheses used for stapedotomy (platinum piston/polytetrafluoroethylene, i.e. Teflon) has any effect on surgical outcome. Two groups of otosclerotic patients were selected, and these underwent stapedotomy surgery during the second phase of the disease. A piston-Teflon type prosthesis was used, 5.50 mm in terms of length but of different diameters (group A: 0.4 mm; group B: 0.6 mm). All the patients underwent the same pure-tone audiometry test before surgery, and then at 1 week and 1 month after surgery, to assess function. We compared air conduction after surgery with bone conduction before surgery. The data collected was analysed using the chi(2) (p < 0.05) test. This analysis showed that the results obtained with a 0.4-mm prosthesis or a 0.6-mm prosthesis are almost identical. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of hearing results when comparing either average tonal threshold or when analysing audiometric data frequency by frequency. It can be concluded, therefore, that in stapedotomy surgery, functional recovery is not affected by the diameter of the prosthesis used. A smaller diameter prosthesis is, however, the one of choice when the facial nerve is prominent or the oval window particularly narrow. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Even the most sophisticated prostheses for reconstruction of the ossicular chain do not work in the presence of Eustachian tube dysfunction. This review gives an update on the mechanisms of middle ear pressure regulation and middle ear ventilation, as well as methods for measuring the opening and closing function of the Eustachian tube. So far, in most tube function tests pressures are applied far beyond the physiological range in order to open the tube or force it to open. New methods like sonotubometry with perfect sequences (PSEQ) or the application of pressure in the nasopharynx with the Esteve technique seem very promising. However, these measurements only provide snapshots of tube function. Presently, new tests are being developed for long-term measurements even in cases with perforated tympanic membranes. Attempts to improve impaired tube function have recently included laser surgery and balloon tuboplasty, yielding positive long-term results requiring verification in larger controlled studies. Eustachian tube dysfunction does not only mean blockage but can also include abnormal patencies of the Eustachian tube, for which new approaches are discussed here. In the case of suspected tube dysfunction, cartilage should be used to avoid early tympanic retraction or recurrent perforation; external ventilation using ventilation tubes should be considered.

KW  - SERIES
AB  - Objective: To analyze the outcome of patients with chronic otitis media (COM) with an intact, but markedly medialized ossicular chain, treated by removing the malleus head and interposing an autologous incus and then an underlay myringoplasty.
   Study Design: Retrospective clinical study.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center.
   Patients: The search criteria within the prospective surgical database was COM with a central perforation (without cholesteatoma) with a markedly medialized malleus handle (the umbo adherent to the promontory) with an intact ossicular chain (study, n = 15) or an incus necrosis at the lenticular process (incus, n = 23). Only primary surgeries performed at our otorhinolaryngology department were included.
   Intervention: All patients underwent the same surgical procedure consisting of an autologous incus interposition and underlay myringoplasty with temporalis fascia.
   Main Outcome Measure: The patients' audiological and follow-up data were retrieved from the database. The postoperative audiogram (0.5-3 kHz) with the longest follow-up was used.
   Results: The preoperative air-conduction thresholds were less impaired in the study group than in the incus group. After their surgery, all, except 3 patients, improved their hearing, and 97% had an intact tympanic membrane at a mean follow-up of 2 years. The air-bone gap was closed within 20 dB in 80% (study) and in 87% (incus), in one third of all patients even within 10 dB. Although the largest improvement was seen in the lower frequencies, closure of the air-bone gap at 4 kHz was difficult to achieve.
   Conclusion: Patients presenting with COM, a (central) perforation, a medially rotated malleus and intact ossicular chain are a treatment challenge. Lateralizing the malleus handle may require disconnection of the ossicular chain and an autologous incus interposition to bring back the reconstructed tympanic membrane in its original position and improve the hearing.

AB  - Tympanosclerosis is a sequel of chronic otitis media characterized by the deposition of calcareous plaques following hyaline degeneration in the fibrous layer of the tympanic membrane and inside middle ear mucosa. It usually results from prior middle ear infections. In this study, results of treatment and clinical findings of the patients with tympanosclerosis are presented. Our objective is to determine the changes in middle ear caused by tympanosclerosis and intervene in the more problematic zone and find out the more useful treatment protocol for patients. Preoperative features, middle ear findings detected during surgery and postoperative hearing levels of the patients who were operated in our clinic between January 1996 and June 2006 due to tympanosclerosis were evaluated. Surgical treatment was performed on a total of 37 patients including 25 females and 12 males between ages of 11 and 71. Preoperative tympanic membranes perforations were presented at a rate of 91% and average airway bone gap was 37.8 dB. Bilateral involvement was present in 59%. Conductive-type hearing loss was present at a rate of 81%, whereas mixed-type hearing existed at a rate of 19%. Sclerotic plaques were most commonly localized in the attic with a rate of 72%. Post-op outcome was found to be 27% in the patients with air bone gap between 0-20 dB. The best hearing result belonged to type 1 patients. Cases in which stapes footplate was fixated had the worst result in terms of hearing. Teflon piston was only applied in one patient. Our tympanoplasty success was found to be 67%. The most common treatment method of tympanosclerosis is surgery. Stapedectomy is recommended in surgery instead of mobilization techniques. However, there is often recurrence and there is no curative treatment. Therefore rehabilitation with hearing device can be preferred as an adjunct. In the recent experimental studies, good results with topical or systemic agents have also been promising.

AB  - Objective: Canal wall down (CWD) tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction (SWR) is a unique technique for cholesteatoma surgery. The external auditory canal shape after surgery-retracted like a radical mastoid cavity or preserved intact-depends on postoperative aeration in the mastoid cavity. However, the relationship between postoperative middle ear aeration and hearing outcome with this procedure is unknown. We characterized this relationship and propose an ideal state of middle ear aeration to obtain satisfactory postoperative hearing after CWD tympanoplasty with SWR.
   Study Design: Retrospective case series.
   Patients: Seventy-eight patients (78 ears) with fresh cholesteatomas treated surgically at our hospital by planned 2-stage CWD tympanoplasty and SWR were included.
   Main Outcome Measures: Postoperative middle ear aeration was scored 1 year after second-stage surgery by computed tomography. The patients were divided into 4 bins according to postoperative audiometric air-bone (A-B) gaps: 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, and greater than 30 dB.
   Results: Postoperative middle ear aeration was significantly greater in the smaller gap bins (0-10 and 11-20 dB) compared with the larger A-B gap bins (21-30 and 930 dB). In contrast to the larger A-B gap bins, those with smaller A-B gaps showed reaeration of the antrum and mastoid cavity. No significant differences were observed in postoperative middle ear aeration or hearing outcome between the 2 cholesteatoma types.
   Conclusion: Promoting postoperative aeration of the entire middle ear is necessary to achieve better hearing outcome in patients undergoing CWD tympanoplasty and SWR for cholesteatoma.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine patterns of energy of reflectance (ER) in preoperative and postoperative conditions in otosclerotic ears. It was also within the scope of this paper to investigate whether the changes in ER pattern post-operatively correlate to the improvement in hearing its measured by pure-tone audiometry. ER was measured in 15 surgically confirmed otosclerotic ears (mean age: 44 years) before and after the stapes surgery. The most prominent change in ER pattern following the surgery in majority of the subjects was a sharp and deep drop in ER value between 700-1000 Hz. There was also a secondary wider and smaller increase in ER value following the surgery between 2000-4000 Hz. Moreover, in most cases the drop in ER values following the surgery in low frequencies (<= 1000 Hz) approximated the mean ER values in the normal group. Comparison of ER patterns with hearing improvement as measured by air conduction averaged across low (250-1000 Hz) and high (2000-6000 Hz) frequency hands before and after the surgery did not reveal any significant correlation. However, there was a general positive correlation trend for ER changes in low frequency band and AC changes. especially for high frequency bands. Changes in ER pattern may potentially be useful as an objective tool for monitoring the impact of the stapes reconstructive surgery and evaluating different surgical protocol.

AB  - Objective: To develop an ideal supportive packing material for ossiculoplasty, tympanoplasty, or other otologic procedures.
   Materials and Methods: Several materials, namely, Carbylan-SX (P-C; Sentrx Surgical, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT), Gelfoam (P-GF; Pharmacia & Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI), and Merogel (P-MG; Medtronics, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), were prepared and then placed into a Hartley guinea pig's (Elm Hill, Chelmsford, MA) middle ear cavities through a large myringotomy incision. The contralateral ear underwent a large myringotomy without packing material being placed. Preoperative and posteroperative auditory brainstem, response studies were performed using Intelligent Hearing system software. The animals were examined weekly. Two weeks after packing placement, the animals were killed, and the temporal bones were harvested. Whole temporal bone sectioning was performed to analyze the presence of implant, surrounding inflammation, presence of osteoneogenesis and fibrosis, or adhesions.
   Results: All the materials, except the P-MG, were easy to place into the middle ear cavity. The P-MG contains woven strands that are difficult to trim into the small sizes needed for placement. The P-MG group had a smaller average amount of implant present compared with the other groups at 2 weeks. The degree of osteoneogenesis was similar among the P-GF, P-C, and P-MG groups. The P-MG and P-C groups contained the lowest amount of fibrosis between the implant and surrounding middle ear structures.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates promising results with PC as a potential supportive packing material for otologic procedures. P-C compares favorably with P-MG and P-GF in a guinea pig model with respect to ease of placement and amount of fibrosis.

KW  - surgical technique
AB  - Background: Anatomical variants such as an overhanging facial nerve or promontory can impede access to the footplate during stapedectomy. Drilling away bone from the cochlear promontory may be required. In the case of a floating or depressed footplate, it has been recommended that a "pothole" be drilled in the inferior margin of the oval window. There is little published information on the anatomy of the promontory with respect to these maneuvers.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty temporal bones were studied. A series of measurements was made to assess how much bone may safely be removed without risking damage to the underlying cochlear endosteum and, hence, spiral ligament and stria vascularis.
   Results: The bony promontory is thickest posteriorly, and here, the endosteum has least lateral projection. The promontory becomes thinner closer to the oval window. Moving anteriorly, the bone becomes thinner and the underlying endo-steum more closely follows the bony contour. The stria vascularis and spiral ligament may be less than 0.2 mm inferior to the inferior margin of the oval window posteriorly. This distance is at least 0.3 mm at the midpoint of the footplate (range, 0.3-0.5 mm).
   Conclusion: Bone may be removed inferiorly to the posterior one-third of the footplate from lateral to a line that makes an angle of 35 degrees with the superoinferior axis of the footplate. In creating a "pothole" in the case of a floating or depressed footplate, the authors recommend that it be created at the midpoint of the inferior margin of the oval window and should not exceed 0.3 mm in diameter.

AB  - Conclusions. The epidemiological characteristics of otosclerosis and its treatment in Andalusia resemble those of other populations with similar socioeconomic levels. Two complementary approaches, such as questionnaires and pure- tone audiometry, are required to assess the effectiveness of otosclerosis surgery ( OS) reliably and precisely. Objectives. We describe a new method to assess effectiveness in OS. It is based on the results of pure- tone audiometry and a specially designed quality of hearing questionnaire ( QHQ). The objectives of the study are: ( i) to report the general epidemiologic profile of otosclerosis in Andalusia; ( ii) to study the effectiveness of OS in our community using conventional methods; and ( iii) to study the outcomes of OS using the QHQ and to compare them to those obtained using conventional methods. Material and methods. All 31 hospitals in the public healthcare system of Andalusia were studied. They were graded into four groups using a specially designed grouping system. The data were obtained from the minimum basic dataset. The prevalence of otosclerosis in Andalusia was calculated from the incidence data, the duration of the disease and life expectancy. To assess the effectiveness of OS, 475 clinical records from 15 hospitals representing all 4 groups were analysed. Effectiveness was assessed by conventional methods, using data obtained from pure- tone audiometry, and by using version 1.02p of the QHQ. Results. The incidence of clinical otosclerosis was 5.67 patients/ 100 000 inhabitants/ year. The calculated prevalence was 0.287%. The number of cases increased progressively during the study period ( p < 0.001). The 15 - 45- year age group was the largest ( 62.2%) and 68.4% of patients were females. The most frequent type of otosclerosis was estapediovestibularis ( fenestral), non- obliterative ( 91.8%). Only 48 cases ( 2.3%) of cochlear and 45 ( 2.2%) of obliterative otosclerosis were reported. The most frequently employed therapeutic procedures were stapedectomy and stapedotomy ( 75.70%). The average total and preoperative lengths of stay were 3.59 and 1.04 days, respectively. There were significant differences between the different types of otosclerosis. Improvement in the air - bone gap was 15.37 +/- 1.19 dB ( n = 164) and the overclosure or operative damage was 0.49 +/- 0.85 dB ( n = 164). A gap improvement of 10 - 40 dB was observed in 61.4% of patients. The > 65 years age group showed the best gap improvement but the largest variability. The quality of hearing measured by the QHQ showed that, in general, a better gap improvement was associated with a higher quality of hearing ( Pearson correlation r = 0.183; p < 0.05). The 15 - 45- year age group had the worst gap improvement but, in contrast, the better quality of hearing.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study was to examine clinical and audiometric outcomes of a laser partial promontory technique in stapedotomy cases with a narrow oval window niche.
   Study Design: We conducted a retrospective chart review.
   Setting: This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center.
   Patients: We studied 59 patients who underwent a partial promontory technique with stapedotomy between 1994 and 2000. Seventy-two patients who underwent primary stapedotomy without promontory technique served as a control group.
   Methods: Preoperative and postoperative audiometric results were obtained for 59 patients undergoing laser stapedotomy with a narrow oval window niche. The partial promontory removal was performed with a KTP laser. Results were compared with 72 primary laser stapedotomy cases without the promontory technique within the same time period and analyzed using paired Student t test.
   Results: Ninety percent of the partial promontory cases were successful (air-bone gap [ABG] <10 dB). The mean postoperative ABG was 5.1 dB, which was comparable to the nonpromontory cases (p = 0.7). The mean change in postoperative bone conduction was also comparable (p = 0.98). There were no cases of sensorineural hearing loss. An overhanging facial nerve was present in 32% of the narrow niche cases and a dehiscent facial nerve was encountered in 17% of these cases.
   Conclusions: Partial laser removal of the promontory as an adjunct to laser stapedotomy cases with a narrow oval window niche is a safe, effective technique with comparable results to primary laser stapedotomy.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and characteristics of tinnitus in otosclerosis and to evaluate the effects of stapes surgery on the course of this symptom.
   Setting: Hospital ear, nose, and throat department.
   Patients and Design: Sixty-two patients (65 ears) scheduled to undergo stapes surgery were prospectively enrolled in the study. The incidence and characteristics of tinnitus were recorded using a specific questionnaire before surgery and I and 6 months after surgery. The frequency range of the tinnitus was noted during standard audiometric examination. Audiometric data were recorded following AAO-HNS guidelines.
   Intervention: All patients underwent stapes surgery (either stapedectomy or stapedotomy).
   Results: Tinnitus was present at the time of surgery in 74% of the patients. It was severely disabling for patients in 24.6% of the cases. In patients who were preoperatively free of tinnitus, no tinnitus was noted in the postoperative period (1 and 6 months). In patients with preoperative tinnitus, tinnitus ceased in 55.9%, decreased in 32.4%, remained the same in 8.8%, and increased in 2.9% 6 months after surgery. Statistical analysis did not reveal any significant prognostic factors regarding the course of tinnitus.
   Conclusions: in otosclerotic patients who will undergo stapedectomy to improve hearing, stapes surgery may also improve tinnitus in most of them.

AB  - Objective: To improve the techniques required to perform a stapedotomy without prosthesis (stapedioplasty), Study Design: New infrared lasers were evaluated for potential use in otological surgery in guinea pigs, A prospective human trial of 34 primary stapes operations using the Argon ion laser was performed, with 11 stapedioplasties and 23 conventional stapedotomies as controls. Methods: Laser-tissue interactions were evaluated for temporal bone and live guinea pig tissues, measuring crater histology and labyrinthine temperature elevations. Patients undergoing stapedioplasty had Argon ion laser cuts with endoscopic assistance made in the anterior crus and footplate to mobilize the posterior segment of the stapes while the anterior portion remained fixed. Results: Diode laser (808-nm) vaporization craters and temperature elevations in the vestibule were suitable for clinical use. Overall, stapedioplasty patients' hearing was improved with air-bone gap closure to a mean of 8.3 dB (SD +/- 9.8 dB), Conclusions: Patients with anterior footplate otosclerosis are candidates for stapedioplasty preserving the annular ring and stapes tendon and eliminating prosthesis complications, High-resolution small endoscopes, coupled with Argon ion or diode lasers promise to improve stapes visualization, enhancing the ability to minimally invasive surgery on the stapes footplate.

AB  - Since the introduction of stapedectomy with reconstruction of the ossicular chain to Great Britain, many modifications in practice have taken place. The changes include patient selection, operative technique and the type of prosthesis used, as well as the number of operations performed yearly. The aim of this study is to attempt to establish the actual practice among British otolaryngology consultants by means of a simple questionnaire. Two hundred (50.3%) forms were analysed anonymously. The study confirms the decrease in the number of operations performed annually, the absence of centralization for this type of surgery in Great Britain and also demonstrated the trends towards stapedotomy and the practice of bilateral surgery amongst younger consultants.

AB  - The management of chronic ear disease affecting the only hearing ear is a controversial subject. The relative scarcity of literature on the subject prompted us to prepare a questionnaire which was sent to European and American otologists and to review 19 cases operated at the ENT Clinic of the University of Parma, Italy, and 16 cases operated at The Baptist Memorial Hospital, Memphis, U.S.A. Surgery of cholesteatoma involving the only hearing ear is advised by all the interviewed otologists without exception, even in the presence of a labyrinthine fistula. The cases from the University of Parma were managed as follows: a classic modified radical mastoidectomy was performed in 10 cases, a staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty was done in four cases, an open tympanoplasty in three and a radical mastoidectomy in the remaining two cases. The cases from The Baptist Memorial Hospital were managed with an intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) in nine and with an open procedure in seven cases. All the otologists interviewed agreed that surgery of the only hearing ear requires particular attention and experience, and should be performed with extreme care by a very experienced surgeon.

TI  - The role of informed consent in risks recall in otorhinolaryngology surgeries: verbal (nonintervention) vs written (intervention) summaries of risks
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Background: Informed consent is a phrase often used in the law to indicate that the consent a person gives meets certain minimum standards. It relies on patients' ability to understand risk information. Evidence suggests that people may extract the gist of any risk information to make medical decisions. Existing evidence also suggests that there is an inverse relationship between the perception of risk and the perception of benefit. Informed consent is the method by which fully informed, rational persons may be involved in choices about their health care.
   Aim: The aims of this study were to study how much patients remember of the risks discussed with them about their otolaryngologic surgery and to evaluate whether a simple intervention, the addition of an information handout, improves their recall.
   Methods: This was a prospective study carried out between January and December 2009 in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Ilorin teaching hospital. Fifty patients undergoing a variety of otorhinolaryngologic procedures, including mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, nasal polypectomy, rhinotomy, maxillectomy, and laryngoscopy, were verbally consented by the operating surgeon with a standard checklist of potential surgical complications and adverse effects. Three surgeons participated in the study. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: a higher education group and a lower education group. Within each group, patients were randomized to either a control group, consisting of a verbal explanation only, or an intervention group, which added a written handout to the verbal explanation. A follow-up telephone interview was conducted at an average of 20.6 days (range, 14-53 days) to survey for recall of the complications discussed. The main outcome measure is risk recall. This was analyzed by education level and written sheet intervention. Other parameters examined were patient demographics and time elapsed from when the consent was obtained.
   Results: Of the 50 patients involved in the study, 30 were men and 20 were women, with male/female ratio of 1.5:1.0. The average age was 43 years (range, 16-76 years). With respect to educational status, 26 patients had the equivalent of high school or less (group 1), and 24 had some degree of postsecondary training (group 2). Overall recall of potential complications was 56%. Those who received the handout recalled 67% of the complications overall, whereas those who did not receive the handout remembered 51% of the complications. The difference was significant Recall of the specific risks varied considerably. For those with potential risk of facial nerve paralysis, 88% of them recalled, which was the highest in the study. This was followed by hearing loss (85%) and nasal adhesion (23%). The least were anesthetic reactions (4%) and hoarseness (2%). Those who received the handout recalled 62% of the complications overall, whereas those who did not receive the handout remembered 51% the complications.
   Conclusion: The addition of a handout significantly alters recall of potential complications of otorhinolaryngologic surgery with the recall of specific risk highest for facial nerve paralysis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Importance: The optimal surgical management of cholesteatoma remains controversial. Within pediatric otolaryngology, one of the most vital points of contention is the selection of canal wall-up (CWU) versus canal wall-down (CWD) procedures. Pediatric cholesteatoma has high rates of recurrence (16%-54%). In adults, there is evidence that the selection of surgical techniques affects recurrence rates. This has not been shown in children.
   Objectives: 1. To systematically review the literature on recurrent and residual cholesteatoma after CWU and CWD in children and perform a meta-analysis of the data. 2. To assess the rates of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma between CWU and CWD techniques in pediatric patients. 3. To assess hearing outcomes by evaluating postoperative differences in the air-bone gap (ABG) between CWU and CWD techniques.
   Data sources: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Collaboration was performed from inception to May 1st, 2020, to identify studies that compared CWU and CWD procedures for acquired cholesteatoma in children. Study selection: Search records were screened in duplicate by four reviewers. Inclusion criteria consisted of comparative randomized clinical trials and observational studies assessing outcomes of CWU and CWD techniques in the pediatric population. Studies involving patients with congenital cholesteatoma were excluded.
   Data extraction and synthesis: Four reviewers working independently and in duplicate systematically reviewed and extracted study data. Dichotomous variables were analyzed as risk ratios (RR), while continuous variables were compared using weighted mean differences (MD). The risk of bias was assessed using the CLARITY Scale.
   Primary outcomes and measures: The outcomes were recurrence, residual disease, air-bone gap (ABG), and air conductive (AC) thresholds.
   Results: After screening 1036 publications, 17 retrospective cohort studies were selected. 1333 children were included; the overall mean age was ten years (SD 7.9), and the overall mean follow-up time was 5.9 years (SD 6.6). CWU and CWD techniques were performed in 60% (796) and 40% (537) cases. We did not find differences in cholesteatoma recurrence (RR: 1.50, 95% CI 0.94; 2.40; n = 544; I-2 0%; Tau [2]: 0.00), or rates of residual cholesteatoma (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.96; 2.38, n = 506; I2: 0%; Tau [2]: 0.00) in patients who underwent CWU and CWD mastoidectomy. The mean air-bone gap was lower with CWU than CWD (mean difference: 7.60, 95% CI -10.65; 4.54; n = 242; I-2: 71%; Tau [2]: 5.98).
   Conclusion: and relevance: We show similar rates of recurrence and residual disease after either CWU or CWD tympanoplasty. Our results challenge the fundamental principle of CWD surgery as a standard technique, as there is no difference in rates of recurrence and residual disease in CWU and CWD. Moreover, audiometric results support CWU with improved hearing outcomes.

TI  - Vision Loss in an Infantryman With Complex Hearing Loss: Case Report and Review of Susac Syndrome
T2  - MILITARY MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - Susac syndrome can resemble various disorders resulting in a delayed or missed diagnosis and subsequent delays in treatment. Here, we present how successful consideration of patient history, symptoms, and ancillary testing led to prompt diagnosis and treatment of Susac syndrome by ophthalmologists. A 27-year-old active duty infantryman presented with sudden vision loss in the right eye during strenuous exercise after experiencing similar symptoms in the left eye 5 months earlier. The patient's medical history was notable for mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, confounded by a history of concussions, syncope, frequent ear infections, tympanic membrane perforation requiring tympanoplasty, and loud noise exposures. Identification of branch retinal artery occlusions on fluorescein angiography and low-to-mid frequency hearing loss confirmed the diagnosis of Susac syndrome. The patient was immediately treated with high-dose oral prednisone and subsequently transitioned to rituximab infusions to preserve vision. Susac syndrome should be considered when a patient presents with vision loss, hearing deficits, and or cognitive changes, even if symptoms are separated by time and seemingly attributed to more common causes.

AB  - Background Endoscopic transcanal butterfly cartilage myringoplasty is a prominent procedure because surgeons can perform this operation without elevating the transmeatal flap. Objective To evaluate factors that affect endoscopic butterfly cartilage myringoplasty regarding graft success and hearing improvement and determine long-term outcomes. Materials and methods This study included 86 patients who underwent surgery. The rates of graft success and hearing improvement were investigated, together with the effects of sex, age, operated side, and size and location of the perforation. Results The overall graft success was 83.7%. There was a statistically significant difference between pre- and post-operation in terms of hearing improvements at 0.5, 1, and 2 kHz (p < 0.001). Sex, age, operative side, and perforation size did not significantly affect graft success or hearing improvement (p > 0.05). The perforation location was significantly associated with graft success (p < 0.05). However, the location of the perforation did not significantly affect hearing improvement (p > 0.05). Conclusions Endoscopic transcanal butterfly cartilage myringoplasty can be performed with a high graft success rate and improved hearing. However, surgeons should be more careful when treating patients with posterior perforations. Significance The location of the perforation is significantly related to graft success.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a novel modified asymmetric chondro-perichondrial island graft in tympanoplasty. The design features a longer anterior segment compared to the posterior segment, addressing limitations of symmetrical grafts. We investigated the impact of this modified graft on hearing improvement and graft success rates in patients undergoing tympanoplasty surgery. Methods: This retrospective study evaluated 784 patients with chronic otitis media who underwent primary type I tympanoplasty with a modified asymmetric chondro-perichondrial island graft technique. Demographics and characteristics of all patients, preoperative location of the perforation, and Pure-Tone Audiometry (PTA) were assessed preoperatively, and graft success and postoperative hearing outcomes were evaluated at the 12-month follow-up. Results: This study evaluated the efficacy of a modified asymmetric chondro-perichondrial island graft in tympanoplasty. In 784 patients, the mean 12-month postoperative Air-Bone Gap (ABG) improvement was 17.3 dB with a 99% graft success rate. Preoperative ABG significantly improved from 24 dB to 6.6 dB postoperatively (p < 0.001). Perforation location did not affect ABG improvement (p = 0.193) but did influence graft success rate (p < 0.001). No sensorineural hearing loss, retraction pockets, or cholesteatoma were observed postoperatively. Conclusion: Tympanoplasty offers a well-established surgical approach for restoring hearing function and preventing recurrent otorrhea. The asymmetric cartilage-perichondrium island graft design has emerged as a promising technique to achieve optimal functional and anatomical outcomes in tympanoplasty. Level of evidence: Level 4.

AB  - ObjectiveInvestigate whether nonopioid analgesics (NOA) provide adequate pain control after otologic surgery.Study DesignRetrospective multicenter cohort.SettingTwo quaternary academic medical centers.PatientsPatients over 12 years old who underwent otologic surgery involving the middle ear and/or mastoid at two centers over a 5-month period.InterventionsPatients were prescribed acetaminophen and ibuprofen postoperatively and instructed to contact the surgical team if pain control was inadequate, in which case an opioid medication was prescribed. Level of pain and medication use were assessed with a standardized questionnaire, 1 week after surgery.Main Outcome MeasuresPostoperative pain levels during the first week after surgery (0-10); proportion of patients requiring opioid medication.ResultsSixty-seven patients were included. Of these, 37% underwent tympanomastoidectomy, 27% cochlear implant, 19.5% postauricular tympanoplasty, 10.5% transcanal tympanoplasty, and 6% had a different surgery. The median of the average level of pain in the first 7 days was 5/10 (IQR 3-6). The median highest level of pain was 5 (IQR 4-8). The median current level of pain was 3 (IQR 1-5). Seven patients (10%) required breakthrough opioid pain medication. The remaining 90% utilized NOA only. One week after surgery, 60% were taking nonopioid analgesics only while the remaining 40% were not taking any pain medication at all. Although opioids were required infrequently, there were no significant differences in medication use between the two centers.ConclusionsNOA provide adequate pain control for most patients after middle ear and mastoid otologic surgery. Opioid analgesics do not routinely need to be prescribed.

AB  - The presence of an epidermoid cyst in the bony wall of the external auditory canal (EAC) is an exceedingly rare condition, often necessitating surgical intervention due to meatal obstruction. A 13-year-old girl presented with a mass in the right EAC, causing obliteration, bony destruction, and profound sensorineural hearing loss. Temporal bone computed tomography revealed a labyrinthine fistula resulting from soft-tissue density eroding the cochlear promontory's bony wall. The 8.6 mm x 6.8 mm mass was excised through a postaural approach under general anesthesia, followed by tympanoplasty with cortical mastoidectomy. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of an epidermoid cyst in the bony EAC. Postoperatively, there was a modest improvement in hearing. Despite the rarity of such cases, considering epidermoid cysts in EAC mass evaluations is crucial to mitigate the potential risk of malignant transformation.

AB  - BackgroundThe traditional approach for viewing middle ear structures during ear surgery is still the microscope, which provides both hands' flexibility and binocular vision. The requirement for a clear, direct vision of the working zone is its primary disadvantage. The procedure was modified for the microscope by using an end-aural approach, drilling the bone canal, and then moving the patient and surgeon. However, the microscope has successfully demonstrated that it is the preferred tool for stapedectomy.ObjectiveTo compare endoscopic and microscopic interventions in stapes surgery regarding intraoperative and postoperative outcomes.Patients and methodsThe review was a meta-analytic and systematic review that included randomized controlled trials (RCT), case series, and retrospective studies which studied the comparison of microscopic and endoscopic stapes surgery; 15 articles published between 2014 and 2020 were included in our study.Data sourcesPubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies published up to 2020. The inclusion criteria comprised randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies comparing microscopic and endoscopic stapes surgeries.ResultsOur results showed that the injury to the chorda tympani nerve was significantly higher in the microscopic group versus the endoscopic group. And also, as regards the operative times, it was significantly longer in the microscopic group versus the endoscopic group. But there is no significant difference as regards pain, dizziness, perforation of the tympanic membrane, delayed conductive hearing and postoperative air-bone gap improvement, and taste disturbance between both groups.ConclusionTechnologically, safely, and promisingly, endoscopic stapes procedures are possible. All things considered, our research shows that both microscopic and endoscopic stapes surgery yields good audiological outcomes. A little amount of data, however, points to a decreased likelihood of chorda tympani injury and taste disturbance when using an endoscope. With comparable side effects to microscopic stapes surgery (pain, tympanic membrane perforation, taste disturbance, dizziness, and delayed conductive hearing), endoscopic stapes surgery seems like a feasible substitute. Endoscopic stapes surgery was found to need shorter operating times. In comparison to endoscopic groups, the postoperative air-bone gap increased considerably in the microscopic group. All of the studies consistently indicated better sight with the endoscope. This meta-analysis of the available data bolsters the application of endoscopic methods in stapes surgery.

AB  - PurposeAtelectasis otitis media (AtOM) is a chronic condition where the tympanic membrane (TM) becomes retracted towards the middle ear and the ossicular chain. Surgical treatment for this condition could be indicated based on stage of atelectasis, patient's clinical condition and hearing loss. Over the years, AtOM has been treated with various types of tympanoplasty under microscopic view. The aim of this study is to present the results of endoscopic ear surgery in AtOM.MethodsForty-five patients who underwent endoscopic trans-canal tympanoplasty were included in the study. Preoperative features, intraoperative findings and postoperative outcomes were collected.ResultsPreoperatively, none of the study's patients were classified with a Sad & egrave; Grade I, whereas grades II, III and IV were 3 (6.6%), 23 (32.1%) and 19 (67.8%) respectively. The 3 patients with Sad & egrave; grade II showed a conductive hearing loss higher than 20 dB and a continuous ear fullness, therefore they were surgically treated. The postoperative graft success rate was estimated at 95.5%. During follow-up, 2 patients showed a TM perforation (at 6 and 12 months after surgery) whereas 1 patient experienced a recurrence of atelectasis in the TM (16 months after surgery). The overall success rate at the final follow-up was calculated at 88.8%. The average preoperative air-conduction threshold was 51.1 +/- 21.5, which reduced to 34.6 +/- 22.1 (p = 0.04) at follow-up. The preoperative air-bone gap decreased from 28 +/- 7.2 to 11.8 +/- 10 (p = 0.002) after surgery.ConclusionAtelectasis otitis media might be suitable for exclusive endoscopic surgical treatment, as it appears to exhibit a low recurrence rate and promising audiological outcomes.

AB  - ObjectivesThe aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of PRF-augmented fascia tympanoplasty versus cartilage tympanoplasty in repair of large TM perforations.MethodsThis randomized clinical trial included 156 patients with dry large tympanic membrane perforations. Patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups, cartilage tympanoplasty group (n = 77) and platelet rich fibrin (PRF) augmented tympanoplasty group (n = 79). Graft take rates, hearing outcomes, operative time, and postoperative complications were documented and compared.ResultsGraft take rate was 96.1% in the cartilage group and 93.7% PRF group with no statistically significant difference. Operative time was significantly longer in the cartilage group. No differences in the hearing outcomes and postoperative complications were reported.ConclusionApplication of PRF on the fascia in tympanoplasty promotes healing of the tympanic membrane. PRF is safe, cheap, readily available, and easily prepared and applied. It increases the success rates of large tympanic membrane perforations without the need for cartilage grafts.

AB  - Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is a leading global cause of potentially preventable hearing loss in children and adults, associated with socioeconomic deprivation. There is an absence of consensus on the definition of CSOM, which complicates efforts for prevention, treatment, and monitoring. CSOM occurs when perforation of the tympanic membrane is associated with severe or persistent inflammation in the middle ear, leading to hearing loss and recurrent or persistent ear discharge (otorrhoea). Cholesteatoma, caused by the inward growth of the squamous epithelium of the tympanic membrane into the middle ear, can also occur. The optimal treatment of discharge in CSOM is topical antibiotics. In resource-limited settings where topical antibiotics might not be available, topical antiseptics are an alternative. For persistent disease, surgery to repair the tympanic membrane or remove cholesteatoma might offer long-term resolution of otorrhoea and potential improvement to hearing.

AB  - Chronic tympanic membrane perforation represents a prevalent otological condition, necessitating a reliable animal model for the validation and safety assessment of surgical techniques and materials employed in myringoplasty. This prospective study involved the establishment of chronic tympanic membrane perforation animal models in 16 chinchillas. A thermic myringotomy was conducted on the right ear (study group), followed by cold instrument myringotomy, coupled with the topical application of mitomycin C and dexamethasone solution on the left ear (control group). Results revealed that tympanic membrane perforations in the study group persisted for a minimum of 4 weeks in 93.7% of cases and extended to 12 weeks in 62.5% of the cases. In contrast, all tympanic membrane perforations in the control group were present at 4 weeks, with only 37.5% persisting after 12 weeks, although statistical tests did not find significant differences between the two groups (chi-square: p-value = 0.157, Kruskal-Wallis: p-value = 0.093, Mann-Whitney: p-value = 0.121). The thermic myringotomy employed to induce chronic tympanic membrane perforation in animals demonstrated efficiency and sustainability. This model, characterized by stability and reproducibility, holds promise for future experimental applications in the field.

AB  - ObjectiveEndoscopic ear surgery is no longer a promising technique, but a well-established one. This study aims to compare endoscopic and microscopic tympanoplasty based on current literature evidence, in terms of their efficacy and safety characteristics.Data SourcesWe conducted a systematic literature search of four medical databases (Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov), focusing on randomized controlled or observational studies comparing microscopic to endoscopic tympanoplasty.Review MethodsData related to the efficacy and safety of each technique were extracted. Outcome data were summarized using pooled mean differences or pooled odds ratio along with their 95% confidence intervals. The risk of bias was estimated, by using the ROBINS-I and RoB-II assessment tools, while the overall quality of evidence was evaluated according to the GRADE working group.ResultsThirty-three studies, with 2646 patients in total, were included in the meta-analysis. Success rate was evaluated by estimating tympanic graft failure (pooled mean difference:-0.23; 95% CI: -0.61, 0.14, I2 = 33.42%), and air-bone gap improvement (pooled mean difference:-0.05; 95% CI:-0.23, 0.13, I2 = 52.69%), resulting in comparable outcomes for the two techniques. A statistically significant difference favoring the endoscopic technique was detected regarding postoperative wound infection (OR: -1.72; 95% CI: -3.39, -0.04, I2 = 0%), dysgeusia (OR: -1.47; 95% CI: -2.47, -0.47, I2 = 0%), otitis externa development (OR: -1.96; 95% CI: -3.23, -0.69, I2 = 0%), auricular numbness (OR: -2.56; 95% CI: -3.93, -1.19, I2 = 0%), as well as surgical duration (OR: -1.86; 95% CI: -2.70, -1.02, I2 = 43.95%), when compared to the postauricular microscopic approach.ConclusionEndoscopic tympanoplasty is an innovative alternative to the microscopic technique, resulting in commensurate outcomes regarding success rate. Furthermore, it offers superior results concerning postoperative complications, while it presents a significant reduction in the duration of surgery, mainly when it is compared to the postauricular microscopic approach.Level of EvidenceNA Laryngoscope, 2024

AB  - Background: As artificial intelligence (AI) is integrating into the healthcare sphere, there is a need to evaluate its effectiveness in the various subspecialties of medicine, including otolaryngology. Our study intends to provide a cursory review of ChatGPT's diagnostic capability, ability to convey pathophysiology in simple terms, accuracy in providing management recommendations, and appropriateness in follow up and post-operative recommendations in common otolaryngologic conditions. Methods: Adenotonsillectomy (T&A), tympanoplasty (TP), endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), parotidectomy (PT), and total laryngectomy (TL) were substituted for the word procedure in the following five questions and input into ChatGPT version 3.5: "How do I know if I need (procedure)," "What are treatment alternatives to (procedure)," "What are the risks of (procedure)," "How is a (procedure) performed," and "What is the recovery process for (procedure)?" Two independent study members analyzed the output and discrepancies were reviewed, discussed, and reconciled between study members. Results: In terms of management recommendations, ChatGPT was able to give generalized statements of evaluation, need for intervention, and the basics of the procedure without major aberrant errors or risks of safety. ChatGPT was successful in providing appropriate treatment alternatives in all procedures tested. When queried for methodology, risks, and procedural steps, ChatGPT lacked precision in the description of procedural steps, missed key surgical details, and did not accurately provide all major risks of each procedure. In terms of the recovery process, ChatGPT showed promise in T&A, TP, ESS, and PT but struggled in the complexity of TL, stating the patient could speak immediately after surgery without speech therapy. Conclusions: ChatGPT accurately demonstrated the need for intervention, management recommendations, and treatment alternatives in common ENT procedures. However, ChatGPT was not able to replace an otolaryngologist's clinical reasoning necessary to discuss procedural methodology, risks, and the recovery process in complex procedures. As AI becomes further integrated into healthcare, there is a need to continue to explore its indications, evaluate its limits, and refine its use to the otolaryngologist's advantage.

AB  - Grisel's syndrome is an uncommon cervical spine condition marked by non-traumatic rotational subluxation of the atlantoaxial joint. This systematic review aims to collect potential evidence from relevant studies that reported symptoms, diagnostic methods, and management options among pediatric cases of Grisel's syndrome post otolaryngology procedures, which can aid and guide the diagnosis and management in clinical practice. We conducted both electronic and manual search strategies within the potential databases and included case reports, case series, and articles; however, review papers and correspondence papers were excluded. The post-otolaryngology procedures included adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, tympanoplasty, cochlear implantation, double opposing Z plasty and pharyngeal flap, and adenotonsillectomy. In this systematic review, we identified and analyzed 20 studies encompassing a total of 24 pediatric patients with Grisel's syndrome following otolaryngology procedures. The patient demographics revealed a fairly even distribution between females (45.83%) and males (50.00%), with ages ranging from 2.5 to 12 years. The most common otolaryngology procedures associated with Grisel's syndrome were adenoidectomy (29.17%) and adenotonsillectomy (33.33%). Clinical symptoms included neck pain (75.00%), torticollis (50.00%), and limited neck mobility (20.83%), while diagnostic confirmation primarily relied on CT scans (50.00%). Treatment strategies varied, with conservative measures being the most frequent choice, followed by surgical interventions in four cases (16.67%). Complications were reported in 20.83% of cases. Due to the rarity of this condition, our findings are limited to case reports only, which may limit the generalizability of results. Grisel syndrome can be effectively managed through conservative treatment, including antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs if diagnosed timely. Early diagnosis and prompt management are essential to avoid neurological and fatal complications. This analysis would contribute to improving clinical knowledge and treatment strategies while providing additional insights into this rare condition.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of VELNEZ (Datt Mediproducts Pvt. Ltd., New Delhi, India) as a space -occupying dressing for controlling hemorrhage after ear surgery. Method: A total of 21 patients were included in an open -label, interventional, single -arm post -marketing surveillance study to investigate the safety and efficacy of the VELNEZ ear pack. The patients were questioned for collecting data related to the subject's safety and comfort, adverse events, site assessment, and otoscopic examination from discharge day to last follow-up (eight follow-up visits) at regular intervals. The standardized questionnaires for VELNEZ tolerability (pain/pressure effect, infection, and general satisfaction) were used after ear surgery. Results: The average hemorrhage control time was 1.08 +/- 0.16 minutes. None of the subjects reported moderate pain at any of the study visits following surgery. This biodegradable ear pack had an average disintegration time of 25.4 days in the ear cavity. No postoperative adverse events or serious adverse events were observed. Conclusion: VELNEZ is safe and effective as a space -occupying dressing pack after ear surgery and is welltolerated by patients.

AB  - Background: The preoperative evaluation of Congenital Malformation of the Middle and Outer Ear (CMMOE) is very important. Jahrsdoerfer score commonly used at present, based on CT scanning images of the temporal bone, is often unable to accurately evaluate deformity and hearing level.Aims/Objectives: To investigate and promote a straightforward and easily accessible assessment method, pure tone audiometry, for the evaluation of CMMOE.Material and Methods: A total of 223 cases (244 ears) CMMOE with hearing data were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 180 cases (197 ears) underwent exploratory tympanoplasty with clear conditions: ossicle numbers in 136 cases (147 ears) and morphology in 128 cases (138 ears) and vestibular window development in 137 cases (146 ears), and CT scans of temporal bone in 113 cases (120 ears). 1). The correlation was analyzed between ossicle numbers, ossicle morphology, Jahrsdoerfer score groups and their corresponding Average Air-Conduction Threshold of pure tone (AACT) at 0.5-4 KHz . 2) The AACT difference is compared among the above groups respectively and between the developed and undeveloped groups of vestibular window at 0.5-4 KHz and each frequency of 0.125-8 KHz. Spearman method was used for correlation analysis (calculating coefficient r and p values). For the data followed a normal distribution, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and t-test were employed, otherwise, Kruskal Wallis multiple local rank coincidence test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used. p <0 .05 was considered statistically significant.Results: 1) The correlation coefficients between the groups of ossicle number scores, ossicle morphology scores, Jahrsdoerfer scores and their corresponding AACT are r = -0.187 (p <0 .05), r = -0.073 (p >0 .05) and r = -0.079 (p > 0.05), respectively. 2) Comparison of AACT difference based on ossicle number or morphological scores and Jahrsdoerfer scores with p > 0.05 among all groups, respectively. The AACT difference between the developed and undeveloped vestibular window groups is 5.5 (63.5/69.0) dB HL(p < .05) at 0.5-4KHz, out of 0.125-8 KHz frequency 1, 2, 4 KHz were 5.7 (65.0/70.7) dB HL, 8.4 (60.7/69.1) dB HL and 2 (61.5/63.5) dB HL, respectively, all p < 0.05, the other frequencies with all p > 0.05.Conclusions and Significance: 1) Ossicle number was correlated with AACT, but not for ossicle morphology and Jahrsdoerfer scores. 2) There was no significant difference in AACT corresponding to ossicle number or morphology scores and Jahrsdoerfer scores groups, but the patients with undeveloped vestibular window had poorer hearing than those with developed ones. Therefore, the AACT can evaluate the development of ossicle and vestibular window, and more directly reflect the hearing level than Jahrsdoerfer score. Pure tone audiometry is simple, widely used, and easily accessible, which making it a new assessment method of CMMOE.

AB  - Morphometry of pinna may change following ear surgeries. This study gives information about postoperative changes following ear surgeries. This study aims to measure the variation of ear morphology following surgery and to correlate the type of surgery with post-operative variations. Eighty patients with Chronic Otitis Media(COM) undergoing surgery by post aural approach were grouped into Modified Radical Mastoidectomy (MRM), Cortical Mastoidectomy + Tympanoplasty (CM + TM) and Tympanoplasty groups(TM). The MRM, CM + TM and TM groups had 14, 46 and 20 participants respectively. Various morphometric measurements were taken pre and post operatively. In all groups, the mean Concho-Mastoid Angle (CMA) was increased post operatively, with increase of 11.1 degrees in MRM (p value-0.002), 8.9 degrees in CM + TM (p value-0.000) and 4.8 degrees (p value- 0.657) in TM group. Similarly, the Cepahlo-auricular distances (D1 and D2) showed statistically significant changes in MRM and CM + TM groups (p value < 0.05). Mean CMA of MRM group compared with other groups did not show any statistically significant difference. However, when the CMA of CM + TM group was compared with TM group showed significant difference of 14.53 degree (p value 0.002). Similarly, the D1 and D2 showed statistically significant changes between the CM + TM and TM groups (p value 0.005 and 0.000 respectively). Prominence of pinna following ear surgery is a not a myth. It happens mostly in cases requiring drilling of the mastoid, rather than Tympanoplasty alone. This needs to be explained to the patient beforehand to prevent any confusion post operatively.

AB  - Objective: To provide insight into the intraoperative management, admission course, pain management, and graft success of microscope- and endoscope-assisted tympanoplasty. Study design: Retrospective Chart Review.Methods: This study included children 18 years and younger who underwent ambulatory tympanoplasty at a tertiary pediatric hospital between January 2018 and December 2020. Medical records were reviewed and information about intraoperative factors, surgical approach, laterality, complications, and post-operative perforation closure success rates was collected. Multivariate analysis was performed to compare and contrast the two surgical approaches. Results: The review included 321 pediatric patients who underwent a tympanoplasty. Endoscopic tympanoplasty accounted for 17.4%, while microscopic tympanoplasty accounted for 82.6%. In both approaches, the rate of intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, audiological improvements, and perforation closure success rates were statistically similar. However, patients who underwent endoscopic tympanoplasty were 3.96 times less likely to require opioids in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and had a shorter post-operative admission length. This pattern emerged regardless of the type of graft used. Obtaining an autograft was not associated with a higher opioid requirement in the PACU.Conclusion: While both approaches are viable, our findings demonstrate the reduced need for opioids with similar success rates following an endoscopic tympanoplasty. Ultimately, the trade-off for the minimally invasive endoscopic approach appears to be a less painful experience for the child while promoting clinically appropriate opioid stewardship in the perioperative setting.

AB  - BackgroundEndoscopic ear surgery is a new, less invasive otologic procedure. Since 1990s, it has been grown in prominence because of anatomical and physiological theories. It offers a view of hidden places, avoids mastoidectomies and endaural vertical and postauricular incisions, and has many other benefits over microscopic surgery. The purpose of this study was to distinguish the difference between the outcomes of microscopic and endoscopic cholesteatoma surgery.MethodsEighty individuals who were diagnosed with cholesteatoma participated in this randomized clinical research. Patients were randomly allocated into two equivalent treatment groups. One group submitted to tympanoplasty via microscopic ear surgery and the other group had exclusive trans-canal endoscopic ear surgery. All patients had preoperative otomicroscopic and radiologic assessment to ensure cholesteatoma diagnosis. Audiological evaluations were also obtained.ResultsThere was no discernible difference in the tested groups' operational times, air-bone gaps, or air conduction. The endoscopic surgery group healed significantly more quickly than the microscopic surgery group (5.4 0.5 vs 7.7 0.5 weeks, p > 0.001). The frequency of residual lesions (5.0% vs 22.5%, p = 0.023) and recurrence (7.5% vs 27.5%, p = 0.019) was significantly lower in the endoscopic group of patients.ConclusionsWhen comparing healing times, rates of residual disease and rates of recurrence, endoscopic surgery clearly outperforms microscopic surgery. The endoscope encourages visualization and magnification of anatomy while being less invasive thanks to its improved picture quality, lighting, and capacity to "see around the corner." Additionally, a significant portion of viable mastoid tissues and healthy mucosa were preserved.

AB  - BackgroundCholesteatoma is caused by disorders of the middle ear ventilation that trigger a progressive series of events responsible for its formation. The aim of this study was to identify possible radiological CT-derived parameters predisposing to ventilation disorders and cholesteatoma.MethodsIn this retrospective study, patients diagnosed with cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media who underwent temporal bone CT and open tympanoplasty surgery have been included, as well as control patients with clinical examination negative for organic otological pathology who underwent temporal bone CT for other reasons. For each patient, the following parameters have been extracted from CT volumes: degree of mastoid pneumatization, prominence of the cog, patency of the Eustachian tube, antrum width, aditus width, anterior and posterior epitympanic widths, and epitympanic height.ResultsSixty patients have been included, thirty of whom belonged to the group of patients with cholesteatoma and the remaining part to the group of patients without organic otological pathology. The prevalence of a low degree of mastoid pneumatization was significantly higher among patients with cholesteatoma, as well as for the prevalence of cog prominence (p < 0.001). All the continuous variables were found to have statistical significance (p < 0.05) in the comparison between groups except for the width of the antrum.ConclusionMastoid pneumatization degree, prominence of the cog and epitympanic measures based on temporal bone CT could be good radiological correlates of the ventilatory capabilities of the epitympanum which, if compromised, can facilitate the development of cholesteatoma.

AB  - Chronic Otitis Media is a global health problem causing significant morbidity of life. Various medical and surgical treatment modalities are being used for the treatment of Chronic Otitis Media. Surgical treatment is the definitive option which includes different surgical procedures, all of which have been designed to attain the same goals of eradicating disease and achieve a safe and dry ear with closure of tympanic membrane perforations. Various graft materials are being used for the closure of tympanic membrane perforations like autografts, isografts, allografts and xenografts, each having its own advantages and limitations. The trend towards increasingly less invasive medical procedures, with shorter hospitalisation stay has led to demand for materials to replace autologous grafts, one such material being the collagen. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of myringoplasty in small to medium sized perforations using collagen sheet as the graft material. In the period from November 2018 to May 2020, 50 patients after fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were taken up for myringoplasty. They underwent myringoplasty using transcanal approach and collagen sheet was used to close the tympanic membrane perforation. Post-operatively, patients were treated with antibiotics and regularly followed up. Otoendoscopy was done at the end of 1st month and 3rd month. At the end of 3 months, patients were evaluated for graft uptake and pure tone audiometry repeated to evaluate the post-operative hearing gain. In this study, we examined a total of 50 patients with 25 males and 25 females (50%). The mean age of our patients was 29.42 years, ranging from 18 to 60 years; with almost 66% between 21 and 40 years. Treatment was considered successful if there was complete closure of tympanic membrane perforations. Of the 50 patients that were included; graft uptake was noted in 46 patients i.e. in 92%, closure was achieved at the end of 3 months. Four failures in our study were due to infections. In this study, the graft uptake following myringoplasty was analyzed with statistically significant objective parameters like age, gender, size of perforation, laterality of disease, etiology of CSOM that affect the success of tympanoplasty. It was observed that small sized perforations had more chances of graft uptake. Post-operative hearing outcomes were also evaluated and was found to be statistically significant. Collagen sheet provided promising results as a graft material for myringoplasty and the graft uptake rates were comparable to the success rates of other conventional autologous grafts. Post operatively, significant improvement in hearing was also noted.

AB  - ObjectiveManagement of tympanic membrane perforations is varied. This study aimed to better understand current practice patterns in myringoplasty and type 1 tympanoplasty. MethodsAn electronic questionnaire was distributed to American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery members. Practice patterns were compared in terms of fellowship training, practice length, practice setting, paediatric case frequency and total cases per year. ResultsOf the 321 respondents, most were comprehensive otolaryngologists (60.4 per cent), in private practice (60.8 per cent), with a primarily adult practice (59.8 per cent). Fellowship training was the factor most associated with significant variations in management, including pre-operative antibiotic usage (p = 0.019), contraindications (p < 0.001), approach to traumatic perforations (p < 0.001), use of local anaesthesia (p < 0.001), graft material (p < 0.001), tympanoplasty technique (p = 0.003), endoscopic assistance (p < 0.001) and timing of post-operative audiology evaluation (p = 0.003). ConclusionSubspecialty training appears to be the main variable associated with significant differences in peri-operative decision-making for surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforations.

AB  - Background Obstructive eustachian tube dysfunction is a common pathology, generally accepted as the underlying cause for chronic ear diseases. Eustachian tube dilation has shown promising results in randomized controlled trials, but is a costly procedure.The aim of the current study was to assess the feasibility of transnasal balloon dilatation of the eustachian tube with an endovascular balloon in the context of ease of use, maneuverability, and safety. Methods Clinical pilot study carried out at a university tertiary care facility. In total, twelve patients, were included over a period of 6 months. All patients underwent tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy surgeries. Eustachian tube dilation was carried out transnasal using an endovascular balloon. A computed tomography was carried out after surgery to assess for any potential damages and compared to preoperative imaging studies. Postoperative endoscopy was performed intraoperatively and at follow up to assess for any potential damages. Results All eustachian tube dilations were carried out successfully. No severe adverse events were noted during the procedure, in the postoperative period, or on imaging studies. Minor adverse events such as mild intraoperative bleeding was managed in a routine fashion. Conclusions Balloon dilation of the eustachian tube with the endovascular balloon was feasible and safe in all cases. It is likely a more cost-effective alternative to commercially available balloons with similar designs and specifications. Trial registration The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov; NCT04809753, initial release February 24th, 2021.

AB  - PurposeThe objectives of the present clinical trial are to describe our surgical technique for advanced tympanosclerosis (TS) and to present the comparison of pre-and postoperative audiometric results.Methods21 patients suffering from advanced TS (Only type III and IV patients according to Wielinga-Kerr classification) were enrolled in this prospective study. A pure transcanal endoscopic approach was preferred for all patients included in the study. Titanium malleus replacement prosthesis (MRP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) loop prosthesis combination were used to bypass fixed ossicles to achieve sound transmission to the inner ear. Pre-and postoperative pure tone audiometry (PTA) measurements and air-bone gap (ABG) results compared, and surgical technique was considered successful if postoperative ABG was less than 20 dB.ResultsSix of the 21 patients had been operated on before and the tympanic membrane (TM) was intact. The remaining 15 of the 21 patients were the primary cases, and TM perforation repair and ossiculoplasty using combination of the MRP and PTFE loop prosthesis were performed at single-staged operation. The average preoperative ABG values significantly improved from 37.1 +/- 6.2 to 14.5 +/- 1.2 dB postoperatively (p < 0.001). The mean preoperative air conduction threshold (ACT) significantly decreased from 51.7 +/- 11.4 to 28.5 +/- 9.1 dB (p < 0.001).ConclusionTS surgery is still a controversial issue particularly in stapes footplate fixation. However, our surgical and audiological results in this study are quite promising. The combination of titanium MRP and PTFE loop prosthesis for restoring sound transmission in advanced TS cases is reliable, effective and novel treatment option via endoscopic transcanal approach.

AB  - Objective: To describe the external and middle ear of goats, using computed tomography and endoscopic dissection, comparing them with the anatomy of the human ear, aiming to evaluate the viability of this animal model for training in otological endoscopic surgery. Methods: Images of the external and middle ear of goats were produced by computed tomogra-phy in the coronal and axial planes and analyzed. The radiological anatomy of the external and middle goat and human ear are described. Some measures of surgical interest were described, such as the length of the external auditory canal, external and internal cross-sectional area of the external auditory canal, middle ear depth, vertical angle of the external auditory canal, length of malleus and incus. After the tomographic study, we analyzed the importance of evaluations through the endoscopic dissection of the goat ear.Results: The bony canal is extremely tortuous and shows a bony prominence with significant elevation near the lower edge of the tympanic membrane. The middle ear has a large tympanic bulla in the hypotympanum region. The malleus is shaped similarly to that of the human, but its handle is located anterior to its head. The mastoid is not pneumatized. Compared to the human mastoid, there was a statistically significant difference in the external and internal cross-sectional area, at the depth of the middle ear, in the vertical angle of the canal and in the length of the incus.Conclusion: Goat morphometric anatomy showed that this model is suitable for surgical simu-lation in the initial training for endoscopic otological surgery. It is an important contribution to the development of skills to accelerate the subsequent endoscopic otological surgical training in humans, despite some differences found.(c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Editora Ltda. on behalf of Associacao Brasileira de Otorrino-laringologia e Cirurgia C acute accent ervico-Facial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to measure the distance of the tympanic nerve to the oval window and round window niche in adult cadavers for evaluating its usability as an anatomical landmark during middle ear-related surgeries, including stapedotomy and cochleostomy, and for preventing its iatrogenic damage during surgical practices such as otosclerosis surgery and cochlear implantation. METHODS: The middle ears of 10 adult cadavers aged 74.70 +/- 14.56 years were bilaterally dissected with the help of an endoscope and microscope to measure the distance of tympanic nerve to round window niche and oval window. RESULTS: Tympanic nerve was found as 1.60 +/- 0.86 mm (range, 0-3.11 mm) and 1.55 +/- 0.38 mm (range, 1.04-2.20 mm) away from round window niche and oval window, respectively. In relation to the quantitative values of these 2 distances, neither right-left nor male-female significant differences were determined (P >.05). Tympanic nerve was observed in all temporal bones. In terms of the shape and twigs of tympanic nerve, extreme variations among cadaveric temporal bones were determined. Tympanic nerve-round window niche distance between 0-1 mm was defined as type 1 (20%), between 1 and 2 mm as type 2 (45%), between 2 and 3 mm as type 3 (30%), and between 3 and 4 mm as type 4 (5%). ONCLUSION: Tympanic nerve may be vulnerable at round window niche- or oval window-related surgeries (e.g., cochleostomy).

AB  - Background and Objectives: Non-autologous graft materials hold promise for tympanic membrane (TM) perforation closure. In the present manuscript, we aimed to evaluate the influence of clinical and surgical (i.e., graft materials) characteristics on tympanoplasty outcome in chronic otitis media (COM). Materials and Methods: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and surgical characteristics of COM patients with TM perforation treated with tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy. Univariate and multivariate appropriate tests were applied. Results: We used xenograft (porcine submucosal collagen) in 163 patients, and temporalis fascia in 210. The mean follow-up time was 37.2 months. Postoperative TM perforation (i.e., negative outcome) was detected in 11.6% of cases with xenograft, and in 12.8% with temporalis fascia. Performing uni- and multivariate analysis, we determined that large (three or all quadrants) TM perforation (p = 0.04) and moderate-to-severe intraoperative bleeding (p = 0.03) were independent prognostic factors of negative outcome. Considering the 197 patients with moderate-to-severe intraoperative bleeding, we disclosed that the use of temporalis fascia (p = 0.03) was an independent risk factor of postoperative TM perforation. Conclusions: According to our results, large TM perforation and moderate-to-severe intraoperative bleeding were independent prognostic factors of negative outcome in adult COM patients treated with tympanoplasty. In the sub-group of COM patients with excessive intraoperative bleeding, use of temporalis fascia was associated with negative outcome; these patients could benefit from xenograft materials. These findings should be tested in large randomized clinical trials.

AB  - Purpose The aim of the study was to investigate hearing outcomes in stapes revision surgery with regard to the type of clinic (university clinic or county clinic). Furthermore, the aim was to investigate the risk of complications with a focus on tinnitus, hearing deterioration, and taste disturbance 1 year after surgery. Methods The study is based on data from the Swedish Quality Register for Otosclerosis Surgery (SQOS). Two study protocols were completed by the surgeon, and a questionnaire was distributed to the patients 1 year after surgery. A total of 156 revisions were available for analysis with both preoperative and postoperative audiometry data. Results Seventy-five percent of the patients reported better to much better hearing 1 year after revision surgery. An air bone gap <= 20 dB postoperatively was seen in 77% of the patients. Four percent had hearing deterioration >= 20 dB PTA(4) AC. Eleven percent had worsened or newly developed tinnitus, 5% had taste disturbance, and 3% had dizziness 1 year after surgery. Preoperative and postoperative hearing did not differ between patients operated on in university vs. county clinics. Conclusions Revision surgery in otosclerosis is a challenge for otologists, but no differences in hearing outcomes between university and county clinics were found in this nationwide study. The risk of hearing deterioration and deafness is higher than in primary stapes surgery, and revision surgery should be recommended primarily in cases with a large air-bone gap and moderate to severe preoperative hearing loss.

AB  - Background The piezoelectric instrument (PEI) offers a novel technique for bone removal in ear surgery with a combination of micro-oscillation and cavitation. The aim of this review is to explore the advantages, disadvantages, and limitations of this instrument in comparison to the drill. Materials and methods We conducted a search of PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar in accordance with the PRISMA recommendations. The primary selection included all studies reporting on the use of PEI in ear surgery or its effect on the inner ear. Only studies with a control group were included in the secondary selection. Results The first search identified 49 studies between 2003 and 2022. These reported on a total of 1162 ear operations, during which PEI was used for various indications. Most data were based on uncontrolled retrospective studies or case reports (76%). Only one of the five controlled clinical studies was prospective and randomized. The advantages of PEI weighed against its limitations and disadvantages were critically analyzed in comparison to the drill. Conclusion Piezoelectric surgery is an innovative and promising surgical technique in the temporal bone. PEI appears to enable safer and more precise bone removal in close proximity to soft tissue when compared to the drill. The slower bone removal and cost factors represent current limitations to its wider use in ear surgery.

AB  - Objective. Otosclerosis is a frequent ear disorder causing a stapedo-ovalar ankylosis and conductive hearing loss. Stapedoplasty, performed under both general (GA) and local an-aesthesia (LA), is the most advisable surgical solution. Auditory recovery relies on the patient's conditions and on the intervention itself. The aim of our work was to compare hearing outcomes with stapedoplasty performed under GA or LA and to investigate pa-tients' compliance to both methods.Methods. Fifty-five otosclerotic patients underwent stapedoplasty both under GA (32/55) and LA (23/55). Pre-and post-operative air and bone tone audiometry threshold values as well as the air-bone gap and its closure score, were analysed. All patients filled in a satisfaction questionnaire regarding their concern and level of appreciation of the type of anaesthesia.Results and conclusions. Our data show that the auditory results with stapedoplasty are good and do not differ between LA and GA. Even considering the advantages and limits of the two methods, one cannot favour one or the other type of anaesthesia. Finally, the patient's satisfaction cannot be considered a criterion of choice, since this was found to be high in both cases.

AB  - Introduction: Majority of tympanic membrane perforations require myringoplasty for closure. Recently, epidermal growth factor (EGF) has been shown to promote the healing of tympanic membrane perforations. Aim: The aim of this study was to find out a simple nonsurgical outpatient procedure to close one-quadrant tympanic membrane perforations that could reduce the hospital stay, medical cost, and morbidity in these patients. Materials and Methods: An interventional prospective randomized clinical study was done on 120 patients at our tertiary hospital. The allocation ratio was 3:1. Pure-tone audiometry, otomicroscopy, and otoenodoscopic recording were performed in all eligible patients who consented to take part in the study. Ninety cases received EGF gel application, whereas 30 controls received antibiotic ofloxacin application. Trichloroacetic acid chemical cautery and fibrin glue application were done in patients of both groups. Results: The closure rate was 97.7% in the EGF group and 70% in the ofloxacin group. The time taken for closure of perforations was 10 to 14 days in the EGF group and 3-4 weeks in the ofloxacin group. Hearing gain was observed in healed perforations of both groups. Conclusion: EGF application enhances the healing effect of one-quadrant nonhealing tympanic membrane perforations. It showed encouraging results and reliable safety in the regeneration of tympanic membrane. Clinical Significance: Apart from its use in single quadrant perforation, EGF may be considered for treating residual perforations after failed tympanoplasty.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to establish hearing outcomes after cochlear implantation in patients with otosclerosis.
   Materials and Methods: We conducted a systematic review and narrative synthesis. Databases searched were as follows: MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Collection, and ClinicalTrials.gov . No limits were placed on language or year of publication. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement.
   Results: Searches identified 474 abstracts and 180 full texts, with 68 studies meeting the inclusion criteria and reporting outcomes in a minimum of 481 patients with at least 516 implants. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were reported in five studies involving 51 patients. Intraoperative adverse events/surgical approach details and preoperative radiological assessment were reported in 46 and 38 studies, respectively. The methodological quality of included studies was modest, predominantly consisting of case reports and noncontrolled case series with small numbers of patients. Most studies were Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine grade IV.
   Discussion: Access to good rehabilitation support is essential to achieving the good hearing outcomes and PROMs that can be expected by 12 months after implantation in most cases. There was a significant association between the radiological severity of otosclerosis and an increase in surgical and postoperative complications. Postoperative facial nerve stimulation can occur and may require deactivation of electrodes and subsequent hearing detriment.
   Conclusions: Hearing outcomes are typically good, but patients should be counseled on associated surgical complications that may compromise heating. Modem diagnostic techniques may help to identify potentially difficult cases to aid operative planning and patient counseling. Further work is needed to characterize PROMs in this population.

AB  - Background: Type 1 Tympanoplasty is a widely performed procedure for inactive mucosal COM. Considerable controversy remains in choice of type-1 tympanoplasty in the paediatric patients.
   Objectives: To assess the outcomes of type-1 tympanoplasty in paediatric patients.
   Methods: This study was conducted in the Department of Otolaryngology-Head & Neck Surgery, BSMMU, Dhaka, from July 2018 to December 2019, with 44 paediatric patients having an inactive mucosal variety of chronic otitis media. Patients were divided into 10-14 and 15-18 years age group. All patients underwent type-1 tympanoplasty under operating microscope and temporalis fascia used as a graft material. Minimum hearing improvement of 10 dB was regarded as an audiological success and an intact graft at the end of the third month was regarded as graft success. The statistical significance was set to p< 0.05.
   Results: The graft success rate was 90.9% and audiological improvement was 81.8% in paediatric tympanoplasty. Success rate was higher in 15-18 years age group than 10-14 years of age group which was statistically insignificant. Irrespective of the site, size, duration of discharge showed an insignificant association with outcomes of pediatric type-1 tympanoplasty.
   Conclusion: Type-1 tympanoplasty showed promising result in paediatric patients. The age of the patients did not significantly affect the postoperative outcome.

AB  - Objective: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are patient-centered, evidence-based pathways designed to reduce complications, promote recovery, and improve outcomes following surgery. These protocols have been successfully applied for the management of head and neck cancer, but relatively few studies have investigated the applicability of these pathways for other outpatient procedures in otolaryngology. Our goal was to perform a systematic review of available evidence reporting the utility of ERAS protocols for the management of patients undergoing outpatient otolaryngology operations.
   Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and gray literature. We identified studies that evaluated ERAS protocols among patients undergoing otologic, laryngeal, nasal/sinus, pediatric, and general otolaryngology operations. We assessed the outcomes and ERAS components across protocols as well as the study design and limitations.
   Results: A total of eight studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Types of procedures evaluated with ERAS protocols included tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, functional endoscopic sinus surgery, tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy, and septoplasty. A reduction in postoperative length of stay and hospital costs was reported in two and three studies, respectively. Comparative studies between ERAS and control groups showed persistent improvement in pre- and postoperative anxiety and pain levels, without an increase in postoperative complications and readmission rates.
   Conclusions: A limited number of studies discuss implementation of ERAS protocols for outpatient operations in otolaryngology. These clinical pathways appear promising for these procedures as they may reduce length of stay, decrease costs, and improve pain and anxiety postoperatively.

AB  - Eustachian tube dilation (ETD) is an established, minimally invasive therapeutic approach for chronic eustachian tube dysfunction. The complications associated with performing a ETD are rare. A 22-year-old female patient presented with chronic otitis media on the right side and chronic obstructive tube dilation disorder on both sides. A type I tympanoplasty was performed on the right side because of a tympanic membrane perforation after a ETD on both sides without apparent complications. On the 5th postoperative day, she presented with headache, dizziness and hearing loss on the right side. There was a decrease of hearing threshold on the right side in the pure-tone audiogram and vHIT, cVEMP, and SVV were irregular. The beta-2-transferrin test was positive. Since a right-sided perilymph fistula was suspected, an emergency tympanotomy was performed with a round window membrane cover with fascia on the right side. Intraoperatively, a regular, intact ossicular chain was found with a slightly moist middle ear mucosa. The round window membrane was covered by the promontorial lip. Under these measures, the patient's dizziness regressed. The right ear pure-tone threshold vHIT, cVEMP, and SVV normalized.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this article is to assess the efficacy of esterified hyaluronic acid as a barrier to formation of adhesions and improvement of tympanomastoid ventilation.
   METHODS: A prospective cohort analysis was performed at a tertiary referral centre. 126 ears were analysed in children with cholesteatoma. Esterified hyaluronic acid was placed on the promontory of 63 ears at primary canal wall intact surgery for cholesteatoma. No esterified hyaluronic acid was used in 63 control ears. Cholesteatoma recurrence, histopathological analysis of scar tissue following second-stage procedure, and middle ear pressure were the main outcome measures.
   RESULTS: At 5 years, esterified hyaluronic acid (7%) and non-esterified hyaluronic acid (10%) did not differ in cholesteatoma recurrence (KaplanMeier log rank analysis, P= .52). Esterified hyaluronic acid (n =11) and non-esterified hyaluronic acid (n = 2) ears formed scar at the site of packing material (n =11) (Fisher's exact test, P = .04). Foamy histiocytes/macrophages were found in esterified hyaluronic acid (n = 15) and non-esterified hyaluronic acid ears (n =1) (Fisher's exact test, P <.001). Middle ear pressure was measurable in 32/43 (74%) esterified hyaluronic acid ears and 36/52 (69%) non-esterified hyaluronic acid ears (P = .58, chi-square test). Median post-operative middle ear pressure in esterified hyaluronic acid (-115.0 daPa) and non-esterified hyaluronic acid ears (-85 daPa) did not differ significantly (Mann-Whitney U-test, -30.0 daPa, P = .33). Middle ear pressure was normal (> -125 daPa) in 44% (14/32) esterified hyaluronic acid ears and 42% (15/36) non-esterified hyaluronic acid ears (P = 1.0, Fisher's exact test).
   CONCLUSIONS: We have discontinued the use of esterified hyaluronic acid in cholesteatoma surgery due to lack of detectable benefit. Esterified hyaluronic acid in the middle ear neither reduces cholesteatoma recurrence nor appears to improve the ventilation of the middle ear. Furthermore, esterified hyaluronic acid alters the inflammatory process within the middle ear, the significance of which remains unclear.

AB  - In the clinical setting, the pathophysiology of sensorineural hearing loss is poorly defined and there are currently no diagnostic tests available to differentiate between subtypes. This often leaves patients with generalized treatment options such as steroids, hearing aids, or cochlear implantation. The gold standard for localizing disease is direct biopsy or imaging of the affected tissue; however, the inaccessibility and fragility of the cochlea make these techniques difficult. Thus, the establishment of an indirect biopsy, a sampling of inner fluids, is needed to advance inner ear diagnostics and allow for the development of novel therapeutics for inner ear disease. A promising source is perilymph, an inner ear liquid that bathes multiple structures critical to sound transduction. Intraoperative perilymph sampling via the round window membrane of the cochlea has been successfully used to profile the proteome, metabolome, and transcriptome of the inner ear and is a potential source of biomarker discovery. Despite its potential to provide insight into inner ear pathologies, human perilymph sampling continues to be controversial and is currently performed only in conjunction with a planned procedure where the inner ear is opened. Here, we review the safety of procedures in which the inner ear is opened, highlight studies where perilymph analysis has advanced our knowledge of inner ear diseases, and finally propose that perilymph sampling could be done as a stand-alone procedure, thereby advancing our ability to accurately classify sensorineural hearing loss.

AB  - Background In cholesteatoma, the prognosis of tympanoplasty has been well discussed in terms of hearing outcomes and residual or recurrent lesions. Postoperative dizziness and vertigo are major complications of tympanoplasty; however, few reports are available. Aims/Objectives We investigated each condition of cholesteatoma postoperative vestibular risk using the STAM system and staging published by EAONO/JOS, as well as findings on bony destruction. Material and methods From April 2010 to March 2021, 156 patients (166 ears) with cholesteatoma who underwent primary microscopic tympanoplasty at our hospital were registered. Subjective vestibular symptoms were recorded the day after surgery. Results Postoperative vestibular symptoms were observed in 13.9% of subjects. All of them were stage II and had both attic and mastoid lesions. Attic (p < .05) and mastoid (p < .01) lesions were risk factors. Multivariate analysis showed that significant differences were found in past histories of vestibular symptoms (p < .05) and exposure of the dura mater (p < .01). Conclusions and Significance In the exposed dura group, the length of the prominence of the lateral semicircular canal to the middle cranial fossa dura was significantly shorter than that of the non-exposed group (p < .01). Narrow working space and downward operation may increase vestibular risk.

AB  - Objectives: A sufficient histological evaluation is a key pillar in oncological treatment, especially in situations of cancer of unknown primary. CO2 laser technology is used in clinical routine of soft tissue surgery because of its cutting quality and availability. Diode pumped solid state Er(bium):YAG laser systems promise a higher cutting efficiency and minor thermal damages. The aim of this study was to compare both laser systems with respect to their suitability for cutting soft tissue.Methods: A setup was realized which enables comparable experiments with the clinical CO2 laser (AcuPulse 40ST DUO, Lumenis) and the Er:YAG laser system (DPM 40, Pantec Biosolutions AG). Fresh mucosal samples of porcine tongues were used to determine the influence of laser power and sample velocity on cutting depth and thermal damage width for both lasers. In addition, for the Er:YAG laser, the influence of the pulse repetition rate was examined additionally. For analysis, images of histological sections were taken.Results: In all experiments, the Er:YAG laser shows a significantly higher cutting depth (P < 0.0001) and less thermal damage width (P < 0.0001) than the CO2 laser. For example, at an average power of 7.7 W and a sample velocity of 5 mm/s the Er:YAG laser shows a mean cutting depth of 1.1 mm compared to the CO2 laser with 500 mu m. While the Er:YAG laser shows a mean thermal damage width of 70 mu m compared to 120 mu m. Furthermore, the Er:YAG enables the adjustment of the cutting depth and thermal damage width by varying the irradiation parameters. A decrease of the repetition rate leads to a reduction of thermal damage. For example, a repetition rate of 100 Hz results in a thermal damage width of 46 mu m compared to 87 mu m at 800 Hz at an average power of 7.7 W and a cutting velocity = 5 mm/s while a homogenous cutting quality can be achieved.Conclusions: In conclusion, the results of these ex vivo experiments demonstrate significant advantages of the diode pumped Er:YAG laser system for soft tissue ablation compared to the CO2 laser, in particular regarding cutting efficiency and thermal damage width.

AB  - Purpose To quantify changes in the perceived epithelial border with narrow band imaging (NBI) and white light imaging (WLI) during cholesteatoma surgery and to objectify possible benefits of NBI in otology. Methods Perioperative digital endoscopic images were captured during combined approach tympanoplasty at our tertiary referral center using WLI and NBI (415 nm and 540 nm wavelengths). Sixteen otologic surgeon defined the epithelial borders within 16 identical WLI and NBI photos. Pixels of these selections were calculated to analyze the quantitative difference between WLI and NBI. A questionnaire also analyzed the qualitative differences. Results Sixteen otologic surgeons participated in the study. Stratified per photo, only two photos yielded a significant difference: less pixels were selected with NBI than WLI. A Bland-Altman plot showed no systemic error. Stratified per otologist, four participants selected significantly more pixels with WLI than with NBI. Overall, no significant difference between selected pixels was found. Sub-analyses of surgeons with more than 5 years of experience yielded no additional findings. Despite these results, 60% believed NBI could be advantageous in defining epithelial borders, of which 83% believed NBI could reduce the risk of residual disease. Conclusion There was no objective difference in the identification of epithelial borders with NBI compared to WLI in cholesteatoma surgery. Therefore, we do not expect the use of NBI to evidently decrease the risk of residual cholesteatoma. However, subjective assessment does suggest a possible benefit of lighting techniques in otology.

AB  - Perforation is the most common illness of the tympanic membrane (TM), which is commonly treated with surgical procedures. The success rate of the treatment could be improved by novel bioengineering approaches. In fact, a successful restoration of a damaged TM needs a supporting biomaterial or scaffold able to meet mechano-acoustic properties similar to those of the native TM, along with optimal biocompatibility. Traditionally, a large number of biological-based materials, including paper, silk, Gelfoam(R), hyaluronic acid, collagen, and chitosan, have been used for TM repair. A novel biopolymer with promising features for tissue engineering applications is cellulose. It is a highly biocompatible, mechanically and chemically strong polysaccharide, abundant in the environment, with the ability to promote cellular growth and differentiation. Bacterial cellulose (BC), in particular, is produced by microorganisms as a nanofibrous three-dimensional structure of highly pure cellulose, which has thus become a popular graft material for wound healing due to a number of remarkable properties, such as water retention, elasticity, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and transparency. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current experimental studies of BC, focusing on the application of BC patches in the treatment of TM perforations. In addition, computational approaches to model cellulose and TM are summarized, with the aim to synergize the available tools toward the best design and exploitation of BC patches and scaffolds for TM repair and regeneration.

AB  - Aim: In search of better alternative material than gelatin sponge dressing (GSD) traditionally used in the external ear canal after tympanoplasty, it's aimed to evaluate the use of new cross-linked hyaluronic acid gel (HYA) and compare it with GSD.
   Methods: This block-randomized controlled trial was performed in 50 patients who underwent tympanoplasty between April and December 2019. The patients were divided into two groups according to external ear filling material (HYA as study group n=25, GSD as control group n=25). The groups were compared in terms of edema, pain, graft morphology, epithelization, drainage parameters at postoperative 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th weeks. In addition, pure-tone audiometry and graft success were also evaluated.
   Results: After the first week, edema in HYA was significantly less than GSD (p=0.033). Reaching the 2nd week, less discharge was observed in HYA (p=0.007). Third week results showed edema in HYA was significantly less than that of GSD (p=0.023). In the 4th week, the postoperative gap gain in the HYA group was significantly higher than GSD (p=0.037). The difference in graft intake between groups was not significant (p=0.189).
   Conclusion: New cross-linked HYA gel may act as a promoter in the healing process after tympanoplasty and may have positive effects on hearing restoration.

AB  - Objectives The aim of this prospective, randomized-controlled study is to analyze the outcomes of a new graft technique in tympanoplasty and compare its outcomes with cartilage island graft plus extra perichondrium.
   Methods A total of 44 patients with noncomplicated chronic otitis media were included in this prospective randomized-controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomly divided into 2 double-layer graft groups: The cartilage island graft + cubism graft (study group) and the cartilage island graft + extra perichondrium (control group). The main outcome measures of the study were the air-bone gap (ABG), ABG gain, and graft status.
   Results Graft success rate was 100% and 95.5% in the study group and the control group, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in the postoperative first month ABG and ABG gain between study and control groups (P < .05). ABG and ABG gain showed no significant differences in the postoperative sixth month between groups (P > .05).
   Conclusion This study revealed that both graft techniques have satisfactory functional and morphological results compared to preoperative findings. The use of cubism graft with cartilage island graft has significantly better auditory outcomes in short-term and similar results in long-term compared to double-layered cartilage island graft with extra perichondrium. Cubism graft is a highly promising graft technique with its many advantages.

   This review highlights the problem with conventional surgical treatment of the tympanic membrane (TM), and critically focuses on the literature on emerging technology of tissue engineering and advanced materials in manufacturing the TM and its application to clinical setting. The advancement of the materials such as graphene as three-dimensional (3D) scaffold, stem cells technology with its growth factor, and fabrication through 3D printing made this biotechnology a possible option for treatment of TM perforations.
   The tympanic membrane (TM), more commonly known as the eardrum, consists of a thin layer of tissue in the human ear that receives sound vibrations from outside of the body and transmits them to the auditory ossicles. The TM perforations (TMPs) are a common ontological condition, which in some cases can result in permanent hearing loss. Despite the spontaneous healing capacity of the TM to regenerate in the majority of cases of acute perforation, chronic perforations require surgical interventions. However, the disadvantages of the surgical procedure include infection, anesthetic risks, and high failure of graft patency. The tissue engineering strategy, which includes the applications of a three-dimensional (3D) scaffold, cells, and biomolecules or a combination of them for the closure of chronic perforation, has been considered as an emerging treatment. Using this approach, emerging products are currently under development to regenerate the TM structure and its properties. This research aimed to highlight the problems with the current methods of TMP treatment, and critically evaluate the tissue engineering approaches, which may overcome these drawbacks. The focus of this review is on recent literature to critically discuss the emerging advanced materials used as a 3D scaffold in the development of a TM with cellular engineering, biomolecules, cells, and the fabrications of the TM and its pathway to the clinical application. In this review, we discuss the properties of TM and the advantages and disadvantages of the current clinical products for repair and replacement of the TM. Furthermore, we provide an overview of the in vitro and preclinical studies of emerging products over the past 5 years. The results of recent preclinical studies suggest that the tissue engineering field holds significant promise.

AB  - Purpose Taste perception is often affected after stapes surgery despite effort to preserve chorda tympani nerve. The aim was to examine changes of particular taste qualities and their recovery after operation of otosclerosis. Materials and methods Taste function was prospectively investigated with a questionnaire and a taste strip test (TST) preoperatively, 3-5 days and 1 year after stapes surgery with the preservation of CTN. Results In the early postoperative examination, 34/42 patients had a lower TST score, 7/42 decrease of taste in the questionnaire. One year after surgery, 11/42 patients had a lower TST score, 1/42 patients decrease of taste in the questionnaire. The most pronounced decrease in the TST score was in sweet (- 1.76 points, p < 0.001), followed by bitter (- 1.71 points, p < 0.001), salty (- 1.64 points, p < 0.001) and sour taste (- 1.33 points, p < 0.001). The sour taste had a significant lower alteration compared to others. Men had significantly pronounced alteration in salty taste compared to women. The complete recovery was proved in bitter taste. Better recovery in bitter taste was observed in patients younger than 45 years of age. Conclusions Gustatory changes after stapes surgery are mostly transient with different impairment and recovery rate for particular taste qualities. A sour taste seems to be relatively resistant to damage. The best recovery rate is in a bitter taste, especially in younger patients.

AB  - Cerumen is composed of glandular secretions and desquamated epithelial cells. It protects and lubricates the external auditory canal. Impacted cerumen causes canal occlusion and pressure over the tympanic membrane, causing ear discomfort, conductive hearing loss, itching, etc. Up to 6% of the general population are affected with impacted cerumen, which includes 10% of children, more than 30% of the elderly and people with cognitive impairment. Persistent symptoms despite resolution of impaction and patient repeatedly should raise suspicion of alternative diagnosis and prompt for further evaluation. A 20-year-old female had complaints of decreased hearing and ear discharge. On otoscopic examination of left ear, impacted cerumen was seen in the attic region. On removal of wax with the aid of oto-endoscopy, attic region was found to be filled with cholesteatoma debris. On pure tone audiometry, patient had mild conductive hearing loss of 30db and computed tomography of left temporal bone revealed ill-defined soft tissue density in the middle ear (epitympanum) with erosion of head of malleus and short process of incus. Blunting of scutum was also seen. Attic reconstruction and type III tympanoplasty was performed. On histopathological examination, the section showed keratin flakes with bacterial colonies which were consistent with cholesteatoma. In conclusion, any case of impacted cerumen should not be ignored by otorhinolaryngologist. Further evaluation with thorough examination under otomicroscope/ otoendoscope has to be done which can lead to different diagnosis and treatment plan.

AB  - Pulsatile tinnitus is an uncommon symptom characterized by a perceived sound pulsing like a heartbeat. Here, we report an unusual case of a patient with unilateral pulsatile tinnitus caused by a large, prominent mastoid emissary vein (MEV). A 45-year-old woman presented at our hospital with pulsatile tinnitus. She had persistent tinnitus for 20 years, and her symptoms had worsened in the previous 2 years. She said that she perceived a sound pulsing like a heartbeat. She had some hearing impairment In both theears for a long time owing to long-term otitis media. The temporal bone computed tomography scan showed a large right jugular bulb, and there was a large MEV canal draining into the right sigmoid sinus. Therefore, we decided to perform a large MEV ligation with the planned right tympanoplasty. On follow-up, the patient's pulsatile tinnitus improved completely. According to reviews, this is the first reported case of surgical ligation of a large MEV as a treatment for pulsatile tinnitus; therefore, we report this case with a brief literature review.

KW  - OTOPLASTY
AB  - BACKGROUND
   Majority of the people undergoing tympanoplasty done by using postauricular incision face the cosmetic problem of ear prominence. The auricularis posterior muscle acts as a vector while placing sutures between the conchal cartilage and mastoid fascia and helps to reduce ear prominence post tympanoplasty. We wanted to study the difference in prominence of ear with and without conchomastoid suture placement post tympanoplasty done using post auricular incision. Evaluate the importance of the posterior auricular muscle as an anatomical landmark by placing conchomastoid suture during anatomical reduction of ear prominence post tympanoplasty and evaluate the usefulness of conchomastoid suture during anatomical reduction of ear prominence post tympanoplasty.
   METHODS
   A total of 60 clinically diagnosed cases of chronic suppurative otitis media tubotympanic type requiring tympanoplasty were included in our study. All cases were divided in two groups viz. i and ii randomly by first come first method and were subjected to tympanoplasty with and without conchomastoid suture placement during closure respectively. During follow up period, the prominence of ear pinna was assessed till 10th postoperative day in all cases.
   RESULTS
   In this study, ear prominence was present in 10 % (3) of the cases with conchomastoid suture placement after tympanoplasty i.e. group i and in 33 % (11 cases) without conchomastoid suture i.e. group ii after tympanoplasty. P value is 0.01461 which is significant.
   CONCLUSIONS
   From this study it can be concluded that with conchomastoid suture placement we have better results of healing with less ear prominence post tympanoplasty rather than without conchomastoid sutures.

AB  - Background
   As tympanotomy using the transcanal approach was a routine surgical technique for traumatic ossicular disruption, the efficacy of the posterior tympanum approach was rarely explored.
   Aim
   This study aimed to investigate whether the hearing outcomes improved after simultaneous ossiculoplasty and facial nerve decompression using the posterior tympanum approach compared with the transcanal approach.
   Material and methods
   The data of 11 patients who underwent ossiculoplasty and facial nerve decompression using the posterior tympanum approach and 21 patients who underwent ossiculoplasty via transcannal approach were analyzed.
   Results
   The average air-bone gap (ABG) of patients undergoing posterior tympanotomy showed a statistically significant improvement. Postoperative ABG within 20 dB was observed in 81.8% of patients in the posterior tympanum group and 76.2% of patients in the transcanal group. However, the ABG closure in the two groups was not statistically different.
   Conclusions and significance
   Simultaneous ossiculoplasty using the posterior tympanum approach was practical, and the hearing outcomes were promising for the patients with traumatic facial nerve paralysis and ossicular disruption.

AB  - Background
   There is a lack of studies concerning chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma.
   Objectives
   To perform an analysis of tympanic membrane perforations (TMP), compare the parameters of central and marginal TMP, combining both the traditional and more recent technologies available.
   Material and methods
   792 consecutive patients. The TMP subgroups were divided by central and marginal locations and compared based on signs suggestive of previous tympanic retraction, namely, medialized malleus, tympanic remnants over the promontory, tympanic remnants over the ossicular chain, and incus/stapes erosion. Analysis of the status of the contralateral ear (CLE).
   Results
   Central TMP was diagnosed in 79.8%. Compared with the central group, the marginal group had more reported hearing loss (95.6%), greater conductive hearing loss (pure tone average for air-conduction 43.3 dB and average air-bone gap of 28.7 dB), a larger perforated area (46.45%), more posteroinferior quadrant involvement, a greater number retraction signs prior to the TMP, and more changes in the CLE (71%).
   Conclusion
   The differences between TMP subgroups are highlighted when we use all technologies available to compare them. Marginal TMPs have more altered parameters than central TMPs.
   Significance
   There is a great possibility to enhance the knowledge of TMPs and to improve the pathogenesis-based treatment.

AB  - For treating tympanic membrane (TM) perforation, a scaffold is helpful for TM repair in myringoplasty. In this work, the green-crosslinked method respectively based on four kinds of polybasic organic acids (maleic acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, and malic acid) has been used to crosslink the composite nanofibrous membranes of chitosan (CS) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) for preparing the TM scaffold. The crosslinked membranes exhibit nanofibrous morphology, good physical properties, and excellent biocompatibility to promote TM cell proliferation. To summarize, the polybasic organic acids are effective and nontoxic crosslinked agents to prepare composite CS/PVA nanofiber membranes for TM scaffold.

AB  - Introduction.There are a few discussions regarding usefulness of an exoscope in otologic surgery compared to a traditional microscope.Objective.The pros and cons of using a newly developed exoscope (ORBEYE (TM)) during microotologic surgery were evaluated.Methods.The usefulness of the ORBEYE (TM) exoscope was retrospectively assessed in 6 otologic surgeries by 8 surgeons postoperatively. A questionnaire comprising 20 questions was designed and used for evaluation.Results.All the otologic surgeons agreed that the exoscope is useful as an educational tool; the exoscope had the highest score in the questionnaire (average: 4.75). The question "Will the ORBEYETM exoscope replace the conventional tympanoplasty or stapes surgery?" had the lowest score (average: 3.13).Conclusions.The quality of the images and movies in the exoscope was considered to be high and improved; therefore, the exoscope was considered as a useful educational tool in otologic surgery. Similar to otologic endoscopic surgery, all the members such as the operator and assistants could head up and share 1 image.

AB  - Congenital stapes fixation is characterized by congenital conductive hearing loss that is not progressive. This rare disease may be accompanied by additional middle ear anomalies. However, the occurrence of congenital stapes fixation with cleft palate and oligodontia was described by Gorlin et al. in 1973, and no further cases have been reported in the literature. Congenital stapes fixation was detected after the exploratory tympanotomy operation performed on a 15-year-old male patient admitted to our clinic with hearing loss, more prominent on the left. The patient also had a previous operation due to cleft lip and had congenital deficiencies in the upper and lower teeth. We present the second case report in the literature which we think belongs to this syndrome, which is defined ascleft palate, stapes fixation, and oligodontia syndromeby Gorlin et al.Laryngoscope, 2020

AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to assess change in temperature, audiometric outcomes and post-operative complications following exposure to different light sources during endoscopic ear surgery. Method A total of 64 patients diagnosed with chronic otitis media with central perforation and pure conductive hearing loss underwent endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasty. The patients were randomised into two groups based on the light source used: xenon or light-emitting diode. Temperature was measured using a K type thermocouple at the promontory and round window niche. Mean temperature change with respect to operating time, mean audiometric change, incidence of vomiting in the first 24 hours, vertigo and tinnitus at the end of the first week were observed. Results Mean temperature change showed a statistically significant difference with increasing length of operating time with the xenon light source and when the two light sources were compared for a particular time interval. Mean audiometric change showed statistically significant deterioration at higher frequencies (4, 6 and 8 kHz) with the xenon light source but only at 8 kHz for the light emitting diode source. When the mean audiometric change was compared between light sources for a particular frequency, statistical significance was found at 4, 6 and 8 kHz. Post-operative complications were vomiting, vertigo and tinnitus (p-values of 0.042, 0.099 and 0.147, respectively, between two groups). Conclusion Light emitting diodes are associated with less significant middle-ear temperature rises and audiometric changes at higher frequencies when compared to xenon light sources. Hence, xenon should be replaced with cooler light sources.

AB  - Objectives Nonautologous graft materials may solve several dilemmas in tympanoplasty by obviating the need for graft harvest, facilitating consistent wound healing, and permitting graft placement in the clinical setting. Prior studies of nonautologous grafts in humans have shown variable outcomes. In this systematic review, we aim to 1) summarize clinical outcomes and 2) discuss limitations in the literature regarding nonautologous grafts for tympanoplasty in humans. Methods A literature review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. The study size, etiology and duration of perforation, type of nonautologous graft, and postoperative closure rate were assessed. Results The PRISMA approach yielded 61 articles, including 3,247 ears that met inclusion criteria. Studies evaluated nonautologous grafts including paper patch, gelatin sponge, growth factors, porcine small-intestinal submucosa, among others. Traumatic perforations (62.3%) were most commonly studied, whereas postinfectious perforations (31.9%) and other etiologies (5.8%) comprised a minority of cases. Acute perforations of <8 weeks duration constituted just over half of all treated ears. Overall closure rate was 82.1%, with significantly higher closure rates in acute (89.9%) versus chronic perforations (64.9%,P < .01), regardless of material. A median postoperative air-bone gap of 5.6 dB was found in the 23% of studies reporting this metric. Conclusions The majority of publications reviewing nonautologous materials in tympanoplasty evaluate acute or traumatic perforations, and few rigorously report hearing outcomes. Given available data, porcine submucosa and basic fibroblast growth factor may hold promise for chronic perforation closure. Future studies should report closure rates and hearing outcomes in perforations >8 weeks duration.Laryngoscope, 2020

AB  - Regeneration is a biological process of cell renewal that takes place in damaged tissues or organs. It is naturally stimulated by the release of different growth factors, cytokines, surface molecules, and stem cells at the wounded sites. The tympanic membrane (TM) is an essential component of the hearing process in the auditory system, which can amplify and transmit sound vibrations through a chain of mobile ossicles. Middle ear infection, external sound pressure, insertion of sharp objects into the ear, and severe trauma are the main causes of TM perforations (TMPs), which could result in deficient hearing function. So far, otolaryngologists have employed surgical procedures (myringoplasty or tympanoplasty) to close the perforated eardrum. Because of limitations such as side effects, discomfort, and high cost to patients, there is a need for better alternatives to surgical procedures. Tissue engineering is a promising tool that can overcome the operational risk and restore, maintain, and improve the function of the TM using a range of biocompatible scaffolds, commercially available growth factors, and stem cells. Currently, multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a good therapeutic option for the treatment of TMPs because of their self-renewing, and autocrine and paracrine activities. As there are fewer risks of isolation in the use of MSCs for the treatment of TMPs, they are more advantageous for tissue regeneration. The delivery of either MSCs alone or a combination of MSCs with biomaterials and growth factors (GFs) at the ruptured TM sites may enhance the activation of epithelial stem cell markers and increase the migration and proliferation of keratinocytes resulting in faster closure of TMPs. This review focuses on the current strategies used to treat TMPs and the importance of MSCs in TM regeneration. Particularly, we have discussed the synergistic effect of MSCs and scaffolds or GFs or scaffolds/GFs in TM regeneration. Finally, with the advancement of tissue engineering technologies such as 3D and 4D bioprinting, MSCs can be used to design patient-specific scaffolds, which may contain physical and chemical guidance cues to improve the extent and rate of targeted tissue regeneration.

AB  - Introduction: The external auditory canal (EAC) packing is widely used in otosurgery and is considered to promote hemostasis and to support tympanic membrane grafts. However, few studies have investigated the effects of packing removal time on healing. Objective: We investigated the effect of EAC packing duration on healing after endoscopic cartilage myringoplasty in patients with chronic tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs). Materials and Methods: Patients with chronic TMPs who underwent endoscopic "push-through" cartilage myringoplasty were divided into early and late groups based on the length of time before EAC packing was removed. The graft success rate, eardrum appearance, and hearing gain were assessed 3 months after surgery. Results: The study included 137 patients. Three months after surgery, the graft success rate was 83.5% (66/79) in the early group and 94.8% (55/58) in the late group (P = .042). The graft was displaced in 8 (10.1%) patients in the early group and in 1 (1.7%) patient in the late group (P = .050). No epithelialization was found on the surface of the grafts in the early group, whereas epithelialization was nearly complete 4 weeks after surgery in the late group. Conclusions: Delaying removal of the EAC packing after endoscopic cartilage myringoplasty may promote tympanic membrane better healing and cartilage graft epithelialization and improve the appearance of the eardrum.

AB  - Objective: Tympanic membrane perforations must be closed with surgery; however, most surgical procedures are considerably invasive in nature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of minimally invasive myringoplasty using platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and an atelocollagen sponge for closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforations, as well as to identify the factors affecting the surgical outcome.
   Methods: The records of 118 patients who underwent surgical closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforation at an ear-nose-throat clinic were reviewed retrospectively. After removing the margin of the perforation via a transcanal approach under local anesthesia, an atelocollagen sponge injected with PRP was inserted into the perforation as a scaffold. If the size of the perforation decreased after the surgery, the same surgical procedure was repeated. The success rate of closure after the last surgery was evaluated in terms of the size of the perforation. In addition, the relationships of the success rate with the cause and duration of perforation and patient age were also examined.
   Results: The perforation was closed after initial or repeat surgeries in 95.8% (68/71) of cases with small-sized perforations, 80.0% (32/40) of cases with middle-sized perforations, and 85.7% (6/7) of cases with large-sized perforations. Multiple surgeries (up to four times) were required for middle- and large-sized perforations, and even for some small-sized perforations. The number of re-operations required for closure significantly increased with increase in the size of the perforation (Kruskal-Wallis test, p < 0.01). The cause and duration of perforation were not predictors of the surgical outcome. However, patient age was a significant predictor of the surgical outcome; patients older than 80 years had a significantly worse success rate than younger patients (Fisher's exact test, p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Minimally invasive myringoplasty using PRP has a satisfactory success rate even for large-sized tympanic membrane perforations. PRP is autologous and its use is non-toxic and safe. Although informed consent from the patient is necessary for the repetition of the surgery and for patients older than 80 years, this technique appears to be a promising office-based procedure for closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforations.

AB  - Introduction: Although operating microscope is used worldwide for stapes surgery, the use of endoscopes would provide much benefit such as good panoramic view of middle ear and easy accessibility of the oval window area, stapes, and facial nerve. Objective: We aimed to analyze our experiences of endoscopic transcanal stapedotomy performed at a tertiary care teaching hospital of Eastern India. Materials and Methods: This prospective study was done at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology between March 2017 and April 2019. The patients were diagnosed as having otosclerosis with fulfilling the selection criteria. All underwent endoscopic transcanal stapedotomy. Results: Out of 52 patients those underwent endoscopic transcanal stapedotomy, there were 28 females and 24 males. The mean age was 32.40 years. The mean operation time was 35.43 min. The mean preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 34.84 dB, whereas the mean postoperative ABG was 9.81 dB. Tympanomeatal flap tear was seen in one case. One case showed chorda tympani injury and two patients presented with vertigo after surgery. No other complications were seen after endoscopic stapedotomy. Conclusion: The important advantages of endoscopic stapedotomy are good-quality visualization with identification of vital parts of the middle ear cleft, minimal handling to the chorda tympani nerve with almost no curettage of the scutum. The development of endoscopic ear surgery techniques promises the change the way we approach for stapes surgery. The wide field view of endoscope helps the surgeon to visualize better the middle ear recess, especially oval window niche and stapes.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis The aim of this study was to investigate different stapes surgery techniques in relation to hearing outcome and risk for complications such as tinnitus, hearing deterioration, dizziness, and taste disturbance.
   Study Design Retrospective database review.
   Methods The study was based on data from the Swedish Quality Register for Otosclerosis Surgery (SQOS). Two study protocols were completed by the surgeon, and a questionnaire was distributed to each patient 1 year after surgery. A total of 832 patients operated on during 2013 to 2016 were included. Pure-tone audiometry was performed preoperatively and 1 year after surgery.
   Results There was no significant difference in postoperative high-frequency hearing thresholds among the subgroups at the 1-year follow-up. The CO2 + drill laser group had the best hearing outcome according to the following criteria: air-bone gap closure <= 10 dB, air-conduction improvement >20 dB, and bone conduction not worsened >5 dB. The overall complication rate was low in all analyzed groups. The most commonly reported symptom after surgery was newly developed or worsened tinnitus (6%). Subjective hearing 1 year after surgery was reported to be better or much better in 91% of the patients.
   Conclusions The combination of a drill and CO2 laser or a drill and potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser resulted in the best hearing outcome in this study from the SQOS. There were no major differences in high-frequency hearing outcome when comparing the different surgical techniques. Complications from surgery were rare, and patient satisfaction was very high 1 year after the operation.

   Methods: Four patients were enrolled in the study presenting severe mixed hearing loss of at least one side on pure tone audiometry. Based on complementary audiological examinations including stapedial reflex test and multifrequency tympanometry, all cases were suspected as advanced otosclerosis. Stapedotomy with incus vibroplasty - the combination of laser stapedotomy and simultaneous Vibrant Soundbridge implantation - was performed in each patient. Preoperative pure tone average, speech recognition thresholds and word recognition scores were compared to one-year postoperative free-field values with the implant switched on focusing on functional gain.
   Results: Among 4 participants (3 females, 1 male) the mean age (SD) was 66 years (35). In three cases Nitinol, in one case NitiBond piston was inserted. One-year postoperative free-field functional gains were 30 dB, 34 dB, 42 dB and 51 dB, respectively. One-year postoperative free - field speech recognition thresholds were 45 dB, 45 dB, 49 dB and 50 dB, respectively, while word recognition scores were 70%, 70%, 70% and 75%, respectively.
   Conclusion: Postoperative results in our serie regarding pure tone average and word recognition score proved to be better than those found in the literature. Stapedotomy with incus vibroplasty - through sufficient air-bone gap closure and simultaneous sensorineural component management - seems to be a promising surgical solution in advanced otosclerosis, requiring further investigation.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic otitis media is characterized by tympanic membrane perforation and conductive hearing loss. In the active form of this disease, there will also be periodic or permanent otorrhea. With a number of surgical techniques available depending on intraoperative findings, otosurgery is the treatment of choice in such cases, the extent of which depends on the type and extent of the pathological changes.
   Material and Method: We carried out an analysis of 79 patients with chronic otitis media undergoing surgery at the Department of Otolaryngology, Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krakow between 2005 and 2014. Total audiometry was used as a part of hearing assessment, before the surgery, 6 months after the surgery and in the distant 10-year observation period. In addition, each patient completed the questionnaire and was examined by an otolaryngologist.
   Results: The analysis included 79 patients operated on due to chronic otitis media. The mean bone conduction (for frequencies 500,1000 and 2000 Hz) before surgery was 31.8 dB, it did not differ significantly (p = 0.355) after 6 months after surgery (32.8 dB), while it significantly increased (p < 0.001) in a distant 10-year control of 43.4 dB. The mean air conduction (for frequencies 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz) before the procedure was 57.6 dB, it significantly improved in the early control by 50.5 dB, at p < 0.001. In long-term follow-up it increased again to 61.3 dB and was significantly different from the early postoperative period (p < 0.001). The mean air-bone gap for frequencies 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz before surgery was on average 26.4 dB, it was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced in the postoperative period by 17.6 dB. The level of air-bone gap remained at a similar level in distant control.
   Conclusions: (1) A completely preserved ossicular chain in the absence of active chronic otitis media is the best prognosis for stable hearing improvement over the years with normal inner ear function; (2) Reoperation worsens the long-term results of a hearing test compared to the first operation.

AB  - Hypothesis: Anatomic study of the external auditory canal's (EAC) anterior bulge, scutum, and ossicular chain will generate knowledge applicable to safe ear surgery and instrument design.
   Background: The EAC contains two structures that obscure view of the middle ear: the anterior bulge and the scutum. The dimensions of these structures and their relationships to the ossicular chain have not been previously described.
   Methods: Cadaveric temporal bones underwent computed tomography scanning, and three-dimensional reconstructions were created. Dimensions and angles of the EAC, its anterior bulge and scutum were measured. Distances to ossicular landmarks and the facial nerve were examined.
   Results: The anterior EAC had a swan-neck shape. The thinnest portion was located medially and correlated with the canal thickness at the anterior bulge. However the thickness of the anterior bulge was not correlated with its angulation. The scutum averaged 3.8mm long with a base thickness of 2.3 nun and a mean tip angle of 33 degrees. The short process of the incus was significantly closer to the scutum than other ossicular landmarks.
   Conclusion: Prominent anterior canal bulges are formed by posterior temporomandibular joints, not thicker bone. The scutum has asymmetric distances to various portions of the ossicles with the incus short process sometimes as close as 0.2 mm, placing it at risk of injury.

AB  - Objective: Chronic otitis media is a heterogeneous disorder. Chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma and, to a lesser extent, chronic otitis media with granulation lead to the destruction of bone structures within the middle ear. Bone loss may appear in the prominence of the horizontal semicircular canals and the bony canal of the facial nerve. The inflammatory process may spread to the bony labyrinth of the sigmoidal sinuses and the cranial cavities. Materials and Methods: The analysis comprised the examination of fragments of auditory ossicles removed during surgery in 21 patients with various types of chronic inflammation of the middle ear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of scanning electron microscopy in evaluating the erosion of middle ear ossicles in different types of chronic otitis media. Images captured at various magnifications were used for the best possible illustration of the observed lesions in bone tissue. Results: The observed lesions and the degree of bone surface damage were dependent on the type of chronic inflammation of the middle ear. The largest destructive changes in the ossicular chain were observed in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma; smaller changes were observed in chronic otitis media with granulation. Conclusion: In the case of damage to the ossicles inflicted by inflammation, the use of a modeled bone block made of a temporal bone taken from outside the tympanic cavity or a biomaterial prosthesis is a good choice in ossiculoplasty.

AB  - To evaluate the distribution of complications of chronic otitis media, dilemma of how soon to operate a seriously ill patient with CSOM and treatment outcomes. A retrospective study was done in a tertiary care centre. Clinical data from 2013 to 2015 was compiled, surgical management with outcome was analysed. A total of 425 patients with chronic otitis media were evaluated. Single/multiple complications were seen in 147 (34.5%) patients. Majority of the complications were seen in active squamosal type of chronic otitis media i.e. 137 (59.5%) cases out of the 147. Meningitis (3.3%) was the most common intracranial complication. Patients with intracranial complications were referred from other departments and did not primarily present to ENT, indicating a major fact that treatment was sort for the complication and not for chronic otitis media. Headache with or without ear discharge was the most common presenting complaint. Fever and pain were not prominent indicators of complications, posing a diagnostic dilemma as patients were already receiving antibiotics and analgesics before reaching tertiary care centre. The patients with severe intracranial complications were promptly taken up (within 3-5days) for canal wall down mastoidectomy with intravenous broad spectrum antibiotic (vancomycin) and mannitol with high risk consent. However ill the patients were, especially children with very poor general conditions, there was dramatic recovery as soon as the mastoidectomy was done. There were no deaths due to the complications of chronic otitis media in our 3years study period. Delay in resorting to surgical management of chronic otitis media was the main reason for patients going into complications. Timely mastoidectomy in patients with poor general condition with high risk of mortality, the surgery actually had a major role in reducing the morbidity and mortality. Lack of awareness that chronic otitis media is a condition that can lead to life threatening complications resulted in procrastination of surgery. Chronic otitis media requires speedy surgical management i.e. as soon as patient is fit to tolerate anaesthesia: Tympanoplasty and Canal wall up or down Mastoidectomy to prevent complications from arising or to resolve the present complication.

AB  - Background: Thiel conservation is mainly based on a watery solution of salts. We have shown that bone conduction (BC) evokes motion in normal middle ears of Thiel embalmed specimens that is comparable to the motion for other cadaveric models.Aims/Objectives: We evaluated whether promontory and round window (RW) motion identifies differences in BC transmission for different middle ear conditions.Methods: We investigated the conditions of mobile ossicle chain, cement-fixed stapes and stapedectomy in seven ears. A retroauricular bone anchored hearing system provided BC stimulation. The motions of the promontory and the RW were measured using single point laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV, HLV1000, Polytec).Results: The averaged differences between the conditions were small for RW motion and for promontory motion. However, for RW motion we found differences of more than one standard deviation at some frequencies. These differences in RW motion were more apparent when we limited the analysis to three selected specimens.Conclusions and Significance: Extracochlear measurement of the RW motion with LDV allowed differentiation between BC for different middle ear conditions. These changes could be detected best in a small frequency range in selected specimens. Promontory motion could not be used to differentiate between different conditions of the middle ear.ABBREVIATIONS: LDV: laser Doppler vibrometry; Prom: cochlear promontory; RW: round window; ST: stapes; TM: tympanic membrane; VProm: velocity of the promontory; VRW: velocity of the round window

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis To assess the somatosensory dysfunction of the auricle and periotic skin in patients undergoing otitis media surgery. Study Design Retrospective study. Methods Symptoms of periotic somatosensory function after surgery were investigated in 100 patients (42 males, 58 females, mean age 41.39 years) who underwent otitis media surgery. Questionnaires on periotic somatosensory disturbance were answered after surgery at least over 1 year postoperatively. Results Of 100 tympanoplasties, all patients were completed within a postauricular approach. The highest incidence rates of periotic sensory disturbance were found in the postauricular region (75%), followed by the auricular region (20.83%); lower rates were found in the preauricular region (2.08%) and the earlobe (2.08%). Periotic somatosensory dysfunction occurred in 48 patients (48%). The most prevalent somatosensory abnormality was tactile hypoaesthesia/numbness, evident in 28% of the patients; more remarkable, inferior postauricular region. Periotic pain was reported by 21% of the cases, mostly located in the upper auricle. Compared to the recovery time of tactile hypoaesthesia (7.36 months), patients' periotic somatosensory pain improved significantly within 4.07 months, which has obvious statistical significance (P < 0.01). Conclusion The likelihood of periotic cutaneous sensory dysfunction should be emphasized to patients undergoing otitis media surgery via postauricular approaches, which occurred in nearly half of patients; the majority recovered within 1 year. Furthermore, the postauricular region is the most vulnerable location to sensory disturbance, followed by the auricular region. Functionally, periotic somatosensory pain was more easily resilient, relative to tactile hypoaesthesia/numbness.

AB  - ObjectiveThe objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of conventional two-dimensional (2D) endoscope with a novel computer-based three-dimensional (3D) imaging system for otologic surgical procedures.MethodsA conventional 2D monocular endoscope with a novel computer-based 3D imaging system was applied to 18 otologic surgical procedures, including chronic otitis media (COM), cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, external canal osteoma and cochlear implant. Operation duration and complications of COM and attic cholesteatoma were recorded to compare 2D and 3D endoscopic ear surgery. Questionnaires were completed by 35 observers participating in the procedures and were used to evaluate clinical and potential side effects.ResultsThe surgical procedures were performed smoothly for all patients. No patient required switching to conventional 2D endoscopic surgery. No significant differences were apparent in operation duration using the 3D imaging system for chronic otitis media and attic cholesteatoma compared with conventional 2D endoscopic ear surgery. Thirty-five observers completed the questionnaires. Most of them agreed that this 3D imaging system enabled them to perceive stereoscopic vision (94%), provide superior depth perception (85%). Furthermore, 97.1% reported no visual fatigue or discomfort when observing the 3D images.ConclusionOur study demonstrated that the computer-based 3D imaging system enables the application of 3D vision technology to otologic surgery. The system has no obvious side effects, such as visual fatigue or time delay. It not only facilitates performing the related surgical procedures but also helps in teaching and learning endoscopic ear surgeries.

AB  - Objective To evaluate the recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) for tympanic membrane (TM) and middle ear (ME) imaging and to identify what further development is required for the technology to be integrated into common clinical use.
   Data Sources PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science.
   Review Methods A comprehensive literature search was performed for English language articles published from January 1966 to January 2018 with the keywords tympanic membrane or middle ear,optical coherence tomography, and imaging.
   Conclusion Conventional imaging techniques cannot adequately resolve the microscale features of TM and ME, sometimes necessitating diagnostic exploratory surgery in challenging otologic pathology. As a high-resolution noninvasive imaging technique, OCT offers promise as a diagnostic aid for otologic conditions, such as otitis media, cholesteatoma, and conductive hearing loss. Using OCT vibrometry to image the nanoscale vibrations of the TM and ME as they conduct acoustic waves may detect the location of ossicular chain dysfunction and differentiate between stapes fixation and incus-stapes discontinuity. The capacity of OCT to image depth and thickness at high resolution allows 3-dimensional volumetric reconstruction of the ME and has potential use for reconstructive tympanoplasty planning and the follow-up of ossicular prostheses.
   Implications for Practice To achieve common clinical use beyond these initial discoveries, future in vivo imaging devices must feature low-cost probe or endoscopic designs and faster imaging speeds and demonstrate superior diagnostic utility to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. While such technology has been available for OCT, its translation requires focused development through a close collaboration between engineers and clinicians.

AB  - Background: An analysis of the scope of practice of recent Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) graduates working as general otolaryngologists has not been previously performed. As Canadian OHNS residency programs implement competency-based training strategies, this data may be used to align residency curricula with the clinical and surgical practice of recent graduates.
   Methods: Ontario billing data were used to identify the most common diagnostic and procedure codes used by general otolaryngologists issued a billing number between 2006 and 2012. The codes were categorized by OHNS subspecialty. Practitioners with a narrow range of procedure codes or a high rate of complex procedure codes, were deemed subspecialists and therefore excluded.
   Results: There were 108 recent graduates in a general practice identified. The most common diagnostic codes assigned to consultation billings were categorized as 'otology' (42%), 'general otolaryngology' (35%), 'rhinology' (17%) and 'head and neck' (4%). The most common procedure codes were categorized as 'general otolaryngology' (45%), 'otology' (23%), 'head and neck' (13%) and 'rhinology' (9%). The top 5 procedures were nasolaryngoscopy, ear microdebridement, myringotomy with insertion of ventilation tube, tonsillectomy, and turbinate reduction. Although otology encompassed a large proportion of procedures billed, tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy were surprisingly uncommon.
   Conclusion: This is the first study to analyze the nature of the clinical and surgical cases managed by recent OHNS graduates. The findings demonstrated a prominent representation of 'otology, 'general' and 'rhinology' based consultation diagnoses and procedures. The data derived from the study needs to be considered as residency curricula are modified to satisfy competency-based requirements.

AB  - Objective: To report a novel management strategy for mixed hearing loss in advanced otosclerosis.
   Methods: A 50-year-old male was referred to St Thomas' Hearing Implant Centre with otosclerosis; he was no longer able to wear conventional hearing aids because of recurrent otitis externa. The patient underwent short process incus vibroplasty (using the Med-El Vibrant Soundbridge device), followed at a suitable interval (six weeks) by stapes surgery. The main outcome measures were: pure tone audiometry, functional gain and monosyllabic word recognition scores.
   Results: Post-operative pure tone audiometry showed a reduction of the mean air-bone gap from 55 dB HL to 20 dB HL. The residual mixed hearing loss was rehabilitated with the Vibrant Soundbridge, with an average device gain of 32 dB. The monosyllabic word recognition scores in quiet at 65 dB improved from 37 to 100 per cent when using the Vibrant Soundbridge at six months after switch-on of the device.
   Conclusion: Stapedotomy in conjunction with incus short process vibroplasty (i.e. inner-ear vibroplasty) is a safe and promising procedure for managing advanced otosclerosis with mixed hearing loss in selected patients.

AB  - Despite the widespread use of the anaesthetics propofol (PROP) and isoflurane (ISO), data about their toxicogenomic potential and interference in epigenetic events are unknown. This study evaluated the expression and methylation profile of two important DNA-repair genes (XRCC1 and hOGG1) in 40 patients undergoing elective and minimally invasive surgery (tympanoplasty and septoplasty) under ISO or PROP anaesthesia. The endpoints were examined at three sampling times: before anaesthesia (T0), 2 h after the beginning of anaesthesia (T2) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery (T24). Both gene expressions were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), whereas methylation specific-PCR (MS-PCR) evaluated the DNA methylation patterns. Increased expression of XRCC1 was observed at T2 only in the PROP group. On the other hand, hOGG1 and XRCC1 expressions were decreased at T24 in both groups. There were no statistical significant differences between the two anaesthetics at the respective sampling times. The methylation status of XRCC1 (methylated at T0) and hOGG1 (unmethylated at T0) remained unchanged in the three sampling times. In conclusion, this study showed modulations of hOGG1 and XRCC1 expression especially 1 day after elective surgery in patients undergoing PROP and ISO anaesthesia. However, the data indicated that methylation was not the mechanism by which the genes were regulated. More studies are warranted to further investigate the possible epigenetic mechanisms involved after exposure to anaesthetics.

AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of facial canal dehiscence (FCD) in primary and revision cholesteatoma surgery in a tertiary referral center. Moreover, our second goal was to identify association between FCD and other intra-operative pathological findings in a group of patients with cholesteatoma surgery. Inclusion criteria were primary and revision canal wall up and canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy in patients who suffers from chronic otitis media (COM) with cholesteatoma. An exclusion criterion was charts with in adequate documentation. In addition tympanoplasty cases were excluded due to evaluate both tympanic and mastoid segments of facial nerve canal. Preoperative clinical data and intra-operative findings were documented in a formatted questionnaire. We found the incidence of FCD in COM surgery was 18%. There was no difference between the primary and revision surgeries regarding its incidence. In addition, there was association between some preoperative or intra-operative findings of COM, such as middle fossa dural dehiscence, external auditory canal polyp, facial nerve paralysis, labyrinthine fistula, and FCD. In conclusions we found that there was no difference between primary and revision surgeries regarding the incidence of FCD. Surgeons should consider effective measures to prevent intra-operative facial nerve trauma in COM surgeries.

AB  - The meatoplasty of the external auditory canal is a frequently performed otologic procedure in recurrent otitis externa, eczema or frequent accumulation of cerumen due to a narrow meatus of the external ear canal. Numerous surgical techniques have been described. The M-meatoplasty described by Mirck for addressing the external meatus is widely used. However, this technique does not sufficiently enlarge the external ear canal in all cases. Specifically in patients where the ear canal narrowing is most prominent in the postero- and/or anterosuperior quadrants of the lateral meatus the technique needs some modifications. In these cases, an oblique conversion of the M-meatoplasty, the MO-meatocanalplasty, is useful. In cases where the bony canal is also narrow this modification allows for a bony canalplasty while avoiding a retro-auricular approach. The MO-meatocanalplasty can be used in combination with myringoplasty and tympanoplasty.

AB  - Objective: Analyze the presentation and evolution of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) in children with cochlear implants (CI) and explore the merit of early intervention.
   Study Design: Retrospective patient review.
   Setting: Tertiary referral hospital and cochlear implant programme.
   Patients: Children with a CI who developed CSOM.
   Intervention: Tympanoplasty.
   Main Outcome Measures: Disease control, recurrence of cholesteatoma, cochlear implant preservation.
   Results: Eight children fit our inclusion criteria with a mean follow up of 8 years. Onset of CSOM symptoms was observed on an average of 5 years after implantation (range, 2-13 yr) and led to surgical intervention in an average of 15.6 months following symptom onset. Cholesteatoma was found in four of the eight patients. Of these, one patient underwent a subtotal petrosectomy and explantation with reimplantation at the same stage but the reimplant failed to function and was explanted subsequently. One patient was initially managed by a canal wall up mastoidectomy and explantation but went on to require subtotal petrosectomy and labyrinthectomy for recurrent disease. One patient underwent a subtotal petrosectomy with explantation and is awaiting a reimplantation. The fourth patient had limited disease around the electrodes that was excised without compromising the implant. In the group of patients with CSOM without cholesteatoma, one underwent an explantation due to recurrent ear infections and a subsequent cartilage tympanoplasty for a retracted eardrum. The remaining three patients underwent successful excision of retraction pockets and repair of eardrums using cartilage with the implant in situ. A mean follow up of 2 years after the implant preservation surgeries shows good functioning of the CI.
   Conclusion: Early recognition of CSOM is paramount in patients with CI as delay in treatment can result in the infection spreading via the cochleostomy resulting in loss of the cochlea. Recurrent ear infections in an implanted ear should prompt early examination to exclude the presence of middle ear disease, which may require anesthesia in a young child.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   The objective is to study the role of tissue adhesives in myringoplasty.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   Sixty cases with a dry central tympanic membrane perforation were operated upon with conventional underlay type I tympanoplasty using autogenous temporalis fascia graft and the glue to spot weld the graft to flaps and surroundings. Results of surgery were assessed after six months postoperatively.
   RESULTS
   At six months postoperatively, 54 grafts were intact (90%) and all patients had significant audiometric improvement also. These results were better than those from statistics obtained from medical records (82%) using conventional methods for Myringoplasty suggesting this technique to be very promising.
   CONCLUSION
   Use of cyanoacrylate glue, in specific, in the underlay tympanoplasty technique using the temporalis fascia graft has many advantages. The main advantage of glue is ensuring the graft stability, due to spot welding of graft with the adhesive.

AB  - Objective. This update of the 2008 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation cerumen impaction clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing cerumen impaction. Cerumen impaction is defined as an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms, prevents assessment of the ear, or both. Changes from the prior guideline include
   a consumer added to the development group;
   new evidence (3 guidelines, 5 systematic reviews, and 6 randomized controlled trials);
   enhanced information on patient education and counseling;
   a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships;
   expanded action statement profiles to explicitly state quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, intentional vagueness, and differences of opinion;
   an enhanced external review process to include public comment and journal peer review; and
   3 new key action statements on managing cerumen impaction that focus on primary prevention, contraindicated intervention, and referral and coordination of care.
   Purpose. The primary purpose of this guideline is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management. Another purpose of the guideline is to highlight needs and management options in special populations or in patients who have modifying factors. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction, and it applies to any setting in which cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic diseases of the ear canal; recurrent otitis externa; keratosis obturans; prior radiation therapy affecting the ear; previous tympanoplasty/myringoplasty, canal wall down mastoidectomy, or other surgery affecting the ear canal.
   Key Action Statements. The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, cerumen impaction, defined as an accumulation of cerumen that is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both.
   The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should explain proper ear hygiene to prevent cerumen impaction when patients have an accumulation of cerumen. (2) Clinicians should diagnose cerumen impaction when an accumulation of cerumen, as seen on otoscopy, is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. (3) Clinicians should assess the patient with cerumen impaction by history and/or physical examination for factors that modify management, such as >= 1 of the following: anticoagulant therapy, immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, prior radiation therapy to the head and neck, ear canal stenosis, exostoses, and nonintact tympanic membrane. (4) Clinicians should not routinely treat cerumen in patients who are asymptomatic and whose ears can be adequately examined. (5) Clinicians should identify patients with obstructing cerumen in the ear canal who may not be able to express symptoms (young children and cognitively impaired children and adults), and they should promptly evaluate the need for intervention. (6) Clinicians should perform otoscopy to detect the presence of cerumen in patients with hearing aids during a health care encounter. (7) Clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, the patient with cerumen impaction with an appropriate intervention, which may include >= 1 of the following: cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, or manual removal requiring instrumentation. (8) Clinicians should recommend against ear candling for treating or preventing cerumen impaction. (9) Clinicians should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment of cerumen impaction and document the resolution of impaction. If the impaction is not resolved, the clinician should use additional treatment. If full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution of impaction, the clinician should evaluate the patient for alternative diagnoses. (10) Finally, if initial management is unsuccessful, clinicians should refer patients with persistent cerumen impaction to clinicians who have specialized equipment and training to clean and evaluate ear canals and tympanic membranes.
   The panel offered the following as options: (1) Clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution) in the management of cerumen impaction. (2) Clinicians may use irrigation in the management of cerumen impaction. (3) Clinicians may use manual removal requiring instrumentation in the management of cerumen impaction. (4) Last, clinicians may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction or excessive cerumen regarding control measures.

AB  - Objective: Chronic suppurative otitis media is a neglected condition affecting up to 330 million people worldwide, with the burden of the disease in impoverished countries. The need for non-governmental organisations to hardwire training into their programmes has been highlighted. An ear surgery simulator appropriate for training in resource-poor settings was developed, and its effectiveness in facilitating the acquisition of headlight and microsurgical skills necessary to safely perform procedures via the ear canal was investigated.
   Methods: Face validity was assessed via questionnaires. Six tasks were developed: a headlight foreign body removal task, and microscope tasks of foreign body removal, ventilation tube insertion, tympanomeatal flap raising, myringoplasty and middle-ear manipulation. Participants with varying ENT experience were video-recorded performing each task and scored by a blinded expert observer to assess construct validity.
   Results: Face validity results confirmed that our Ear Trainer was a realistic representation of the ear. Construct validity results showed a statistically significant trend, with experts performing the best and those with limited experience performing better than novices.
   Conclusion: This study validates our Ear Trainer as a useful training tool for assessing headlight and microsurgical skills required to perform otological procedures.

AB  - Knowledge of the vascularization of the malleus may help to better understand some unwanted effects occurred in those surgical techniques using the handle as an attachment site of ossicle-replacement prostheses. Our hypothesis is that vascular damage occurred in the long process of the malleus during tympanic membrane detachment before fastening a malleovestibulopexy (MVP) prosthesis promotes the lysis of this ossicle at the attachment site. To confirm this premise, we carried out an evolutive and descriptive study of ten MVP procedures as well as a morphological analysis of ten cadaveric mallei using both light and scanning electron microscopies. The arterial supply of the manubrium comes from two main sources: vascular branches that reach this ossicle from the site of insertion of the tensor tympani tendon and small perforating branches which penetrate the bone from arteries of the tympanic membrane that, following the periosteum/perichondrium, they arrange parallel to the bone. The detachment of the tympanic membrane to fasten a MVP prosthesis causes a damage in the periosteal/perichondral vascular supply of the handle as well as micro-trauma on it, which can promote bone resorption at the point of anchorage by osteoclast stimulation. Respect periosteal vascularization of the manubrium may be important to prevent damage in this ossicle caused by some middle ear reconstruction prostheses.

AB  - Severe to profound mixed hearing loss is associated with hearing rehabilitation difficulties. Recently, promising results for speech understanding were obtained with a direct acoustic cochlear implant (DACI). The surgical implantation of a DACI with standard coupling through a stapedotomy can however be regarded as challenging. Therefore, in this experimental study, the feasibility of direct acoustic stimulation was investigated at an anatomically and surgically more accessible inner ear site. DACI stimulation of the intact, blue-lined and opened lateral semicircular canal (LC) was investigated and compared with standard oval window (OW) coupling. Additionally, stapes footplate fixation was induced. Round window (RW) velocity, as a measure of the performance of the device and its coupling efficiency, was determined in fresh-frozen human cadaver heads. Using single point laser Doppler vibrometry, RW velocity could reliably be measured in low and middle frequency range, and equivalent sound pressure level (L-E) output was calculated. Results for the different conditions obtained in five heads were analyzed in subsequent frequency ranges. Comparing the difference in RW membrane velocity showed higher L-E in the LC opened condition [mean: 103 equivalent dB SPL], than in LC intact or blue-lined conditions [63 and 74 equivalent dB SPL, respectively]. No difference was observed between the LC opened and the standard OW condition. Inducing stapes fixation, however, led to a difference in the low frequency range of L-E compared to LC opened. In conclusion, this feasibility study showed promising results for direct acoustic stimulation at this specific anatomically and surgically more accessible inner ear site. Future studies are needed to address the impact of LC stimulation on cochlear micromechanics and on the vestibular system like dizziness and risks of hearing loss.

AB  - Objective To investigate the effectiveness of scaffold-embedded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a topical treatment for healing tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) in a mouse model.
   Study Design Prospective animal study.
   Setting Experimental.
   Subjects and Methods In vitro: under sterile conditions, porcine-derived (Gelita-Spon [GS]), hyaluronate-derived (EpiDisc [ED]), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) scaffolds were cut into small pieces and cocultured with murine bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) for 72 hours. The cultures were either analyzed by confocal microscopy or used for subsequent in vivo experiments. In vivo: 26 mice were divided into 3 groups (ie, control [n = 9], GS [n = 8], ED [n = 9]). Under general anesthesia, TMPs of equal sizes were performed bilaterally using a sterile 27-gauge needle under a surgical microscope. The BM-MSCs embedded within GS or ED scaffolds were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline and then topically applied on right TMPs, and scaffolds alone were applied on left TMPs 6 to 8 hours after injury. Control mice did not receive treatment. On day 7, animals were euthanized and bullae were harvested for histological analysis.
   Results In vitro: BM-MSCs grew well on both GS (P = .0012) and ED (P = .0001) scaffolds compared with PVA. In vivo: 100% of untreated (control) TMPs remained open after 7 days. Animals treated with MSC-embedded ED scaffolds had a higher percentage of TMP closure (P = .016) and a thicker neotympanum (P = .0033) than control animals. The experimentally applied BM-MSCs engrafted and differentiated into epithelial cells suggested by the colocalized expression of cytokeratin-19 and GFP.
   Conclusions The topical application of bone marrow-derived MSCs enhances the healing of TMPs in this animal model and is a promising alternative to tympanoplasty.

AB  - Objective This study examines the effectiveness of acoustic reflexes in screening for third window disorders (eg, superior semicircular canal dehiscence) prior to middle ear exploration for conductive hearing loss.
   Study Design Case series with chart review.
   Setting Outpatient tertiary otology center.
   Subjects and Methods A review was performed of 212 ears with acoustic reflexes, performed as part of the evaluation of conductive hearing loss in patients without evidence of chronic otitis media. The etiology of hearing loss was determined from intraoperative findings and computed tomography imaging. The relationship between acoustic reflexes and conductive hearing loss etiology was assessed.
   Results Eighty-eight percent of ears (166 of 189) demonstrating absence of all acoustic reflexes had an ossicular etiology of conductive hearing loss. Fifty-two percent of ears (12 of 23) with at least 1 detectable acoustic reflex had a nonossicular etiology. The positive and negative predictive values for an ossicular etiology were 89% and 57% when acoustic reflexes were used alone for screening, 89% and 39% when third window symptoms were used alone, and 94% and 71% when reflexes and symptoms were used together, respectively.
   Conclusion Acoustic reflex testing is an effective means of screening for third window disorders in patients with a conductive hearing loss. Questioning for third window symptoms should complement screening. The detection of even 1 acoustic reflex or third window symptom (regardless of reflex status) should prompt further workup prior to middle ear exploration.

AB  - Objectives: Adhesive otitis is a chronic otitis media (OM) that consists of the adhesion of the tympanic membrane (TM) to the promontory.
   The aim of our study is to evaluate a new way of positioning subannular T-tubes (SATs) in patients affected by adhesive otitis.
   Methodology: This study enrolled 22 patients (average age: 36.7 yo, 2.5 SD; M/F ratio: 14/8) affected by unilateral chronic adhesive otitis. All of the patients underwent the positioning of a SAT and a Silastic (R) sheet in the tympanic cavity. The clinical course was evaluated, considering otoscopic and audiological variations.
   Results: In our series, only one case of extrusion of tubes with residual perforation of TM was recorded. Auditory outcomes were satisfying in 18/22 patients (81.8%).
   Conclusions: The proposed addition of a Silastic disk seems to avoid a new adhesion of the tympanic membrane to the promontory and, therefore, prevents treatment failures. A longer follow-up and a larger case series are needed to prove the efficacy of this surgical variation. Finally, the positioning of SATs can be considered as a valid and safe procedure for the treatment of adhesive otitis.

AB  - Objective: A pilot study was performed to investigate the utility of basic fibroblast growth factor (bEGF) in the repair of blast-induced total or near-total tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs).
   Study design: Prospective clinical study.
   Setting: Tertiary university hospital.
   Subjects and methods: Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were treated with 0.10 +/- 0.15 mL of bEGF solution applied directly to total or near-total TMPs once daily until the perforations closed or for a maximum of 6 months. The treatment response was monitored via serial otoendoscopy, and audiometric outcomes were evaluated.
   Results: Complete TMP closure was achieved in 16 of 17 patients with a blast-induced total or near-total TMP. The mean closure time was 28.4 +/- 10.9 days. The improvement in hearing from pre- to post-treatment was statistically significant. There were no complications or adverse outcomes.
   Conclusions: The direct application of bFGF to blast-induced total or near-total TMPs is a promising, minimally invasive alternative to conventional tympanoplasty, with a comparable success rate. As reported in the literature, the closure rate was higher than achieved with spontaneous healing. There was no effect of the inverted edge on healing outcome. The use of bFGF in this setting has immediate therapeutic applications for military personnel with blast-induced TMPs who are stationed in isolated, remote environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - To investigate the feasibility of applying the transcanal endoscopic approach (TEA) for surgical treatment of residual/recurrent cholesteatoma and present the preliminary results of 17 revision procedures that were carried out with this minimally invasive approach. The records of 17 patients (aged 5-76 years) who underwent transcanal revision procedure using rigid 3-mm diameter, 0A degrees, 30A degrees and 45A degrees endoscopes between 2009 and 2012 were retrospectively reviewed. A wide posterior tympanomeatal flap was elevated via the external auditory canal and then transposed inferiorly in cases of cholesteatoma situated in the middle ear under a tympanic membrane. In certain cases, cholesteatoma was assessed and removed using the endoscopes directly from the radical cavity or from the mastoid cavity remaining after a canal-wall-down procedure. Six patients had originally undergone the canal-wall-up mastoidectomy, 6 patients had a canal-wall-down mastoidectomy and 5 patients had radical mastoid cavities. The interval between the previous and the index surgery ranged between 1 and 6 years. The attic was the most common site involved with cholesteatoma, followed by the tympanic portion of the facial nerve, sinus tympani, mastoid, supratubal recess, promontory, round and oval windows. The size of residual/recurrent lesion varied between 3 and 15 mm. The patients were followed up 26-67 months (mean 52.1 months). The single recurrence (a 4-mm pearl over the tympanic portion of the facial nerve) was eradicated by a transcanal re-revision 1 year following the index surgery. Minimally invasive TEA can be successfully applied in carefully selected patients with endoscopically accessible cholesteatoma subsequent to various types of mastoidectomy.

AB  - Hypothesis
   That heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) heals chronic tympanic membrane (TM) perforations at higher rates than fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in an animal model.
   Background
   A nonsurgical treatment for chronic TM perforation would benefit those unable to access surgery or those unable to have surgery, as well as reducing the cost of tympanoplasty. Growth factor (GF) treatments have been reported in the literature with variable success with the lack of a suitable animal providing a major obstacle.
   Methods
   The GFs were tested in a validated mouse model of chronic TM perforation. A bioabsorbable hydrogel polymer was used to deliver the GF at a steady concentration as it dissolved over 4 weeks. A control (polymer only, n = 18) was compared to polymer loaded with HB-EGF (5 mu g/ml, n = 18), FGF2 (100 mu g/ml, n = 19), and EGF (250 mu g/ml, n = 19). Perforations were inspected at 4 weeks.
   Results
   The healing rates, as defined as 100% perforation closure, were control (5/18, 27.8%), HB-EGF (15/18, 83.3%), FGF2 (6/19, 31.6%), and EGF (3/19, 15.8%). There were no differences between FGF2 (p = 0.80) and EGF (p = 0.31) with control healing rates. HB-EGF (p = 0.000001) showed a significant difference for healing. The HB-EGF healed TMs showed layers similar to a normal TM, whereas the other groups showed a lack of epithelial migration.
   Conclusion
   This study confirms the advantage of HB-EGF over two other commonly used growth factors and is a promising nonsurgical treatment of chronic TM perforations.

AB  - Introduction: A novel bioactive material for tissue graft, derived from porcine small intestinal mucosa (SIS) has been marketed. This material promotes early vessel growth, provides scaffolding for the remodeling tissues, and is inexpensive and ready-to-use. We evaluated efficacy, safety, and surgery time of SIS myringoplasty, in comparison with autologous temporalis fascia (PTF) repair in children in a prospective, two-group (SIS and PTF) randomized, blinded study at a tertiary-care pediatric institution.
   Materials and methods: 404 children with tympanic membrane (TM) repair were randomly assigned to receive SIS or PTF myringoplasty. Primary outcome was the healing of the TM at 6 months. Secondary outcomes were surgical time, and adverse events. Long-term follow-up ranging from 11 to 2 years was obtained in all enrolled children. Audiometric tests as pure-tone thresholds were applied in all patients. The Fisher's exact test and the Kriskal-Wallis test were applied for statistical analysis.
   Results and discussions: Four-hundred-thirty-two TM perforations were treated, 217 in the SIS and 215 in the PTF groups. There were 209 stable TM closures in the SIS (96.3%) and 204(94.8%) in the PTF arm. This difference was not statistically significant (odds ratio = 0.4, 95%; confidence interval = 0.12-1.41). SIS myringoplasty yielded reduced surgical time. No adverse reaction to SIS was encountered. Audiometric tests revealed no statistically significant difference in the two groups.
   Conclusions: SIS myringoplasty is a safe and effective method for TM closure in children with reduced surgical time, as compared to PTF. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this study, we describe three unrelated Japanese patients with hearing loss and symphalangism who were diagnosed with proximal symphalangism (SYM1), atypical multiple synostosis syndrome (atypical SYNS1) and stapes ankylosis with broad thumb and toes (SABTT), respectively, based on the clinical features. Surgical findings in the middle ear were similar among the patients. By next-generation and Sanger sequencing analyses, we identified two novel mutations, c.559C>G (p. P178A) and c. 682T>A (p. C228S), in the SYM1 and atypical SYNS1 families, respectively. No pathogenic changes were found in the protein-coding regions, exon-intron boundaries or promoter regions of the NOG, GDF5 or FGF9 genes in the SABTT family. Such negative molecular data suggest there may be further genetic heterogeneity underlying SYNS1, with the involvement of at least one additional gene. Stapedotomy resulted in good hearing in all patients over the long term, indicating no correlation between genotype and surgical outcome. Given the overlap of the clinical features of these syndromes in our patients and the molecular findings, the diagnostic term 'NOG-related-symphalangism spectrum disorder (NOG-SSD)' is advocated and an unidentified gene may be responsible for this disorder.

AB  - The persistent stapedial artery (PSA) is a very rare, congenital, vascular anomaly. It presents as a pulsatile middle ear mass and sometimes causes conductive hearing loss. The diagnosis of the presence of a PSA is always accidental, because it is so rare and difficult to predict. CT findings include the absence of the foramen spinosum and a soft-tissue prominence in the region of the tympanic segment of the facial nerve. The risks of surgery include facial palsy, hemiplegia caused by coagulation of the PSA, and bleeding due to injury of the carotid artery during surgery in cases of aberrant internal carotid. In this article we report a case of PSA with stapes ankylosis for which we performed malleus-stapedotomy using a Teflon wire piston. We did not coagulate the PSA. Nevertheless the PSA attached to the prosthesis, the patient presented significant improvement in hearing level and had no complaint of pulsating tinnitus. Thus, we have shown that attachment of the prosthesis to the PSA does not necessarily disturb improvement of hearing level after malleus-stapedotomy for otosclerosis with PSA. Based on our experience, many cases can be treated by stapedotomy using a prosthesis and without coagulating the PSA. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: This study was focused on the assessment of patient's improvement in hearing, as measured by pure tone audiometry after stapedotomy for primary otosclerosis.
   Materials and Methods: This prospective clinical study was performed in a total of 50 patients diagnosed with Primary Otosclerosis, who underwent Stapedotomy at the Department of ENT & Head-Neck Surgery, Combined Military Hospital, Dhaka between June 2012 to January 2014. All patients were evaluated as per the candidacy criteria for stapedotomy and selected patients underwent surgery during the study period and were followed up for a period of 12 months in the Otology clinic. Pre-operative and Post-operative audiometric evaluation was done using conventional pure tone audiometry with standard calibrations. Post-operative audiometry was performed at 03 month, 06 months and 12 months. The bone-conduction & air conduction thresholds and the Air-Bone gap (ABG), were documented and analysed at 0.5 KHz, 1 KHz, 2 KHz and 4 KHz frequencies respectively. The subjective outcomes in hearing were also recorded with a patient satisfaction questionnaire to assess improvement in quality of hearing after stapedotomy.
   Results: Overall, the frequency specific pre-operative mean averaged Air Conduction thresholds were 63.3dB at 500Hz, 57.5dB at 1 KHz, 55.1dB at 2 KHz and 45.7dB at 4 KHz. The frequency specific post-operative mean averaged Air conduction thresolds were 34.6 dB at 500Hz, 28.9 dB at 1Kz, 30.5dB at 2Kz and 33.3dB at 4Kz. The frequency specific mean average post operative Air Bone Gap (ABG) closure was achieved by 28.7dB at 500Hz, 27.6 dB at 1KHz, 24.6 dB at 2KHz and 12.4 dB at 4KHz by the time of completion of the study at 01 year. A successful closure of AB gap to less than 10dB was achieved in the speech frequencies of 2 KHz and 4 KHz in 84% of cases. Overall, the frequency specific bone-conduction thresholds were unchanged postoperatively in all cases except one, showing that no significant sensori-neural impairment had occured due to the stapedotomy procedure. 1 patient developed post-op severe vertigo which was self-limiting after six weeks. A few interesting cases with anomalous intra-operative findings were also documented and reported herewith. These included monopodal stapes (n=1), anomolous facial nerve (n=1), laterally placed chorda tympani nerve (n=1), high jugular bulb, Malleus ankylosis (n=1) and persistent stapedial artery (n=1). All patients included in our study had significant subjective audiological improvement and responded satisfactorily to the questionnaire formulated to assess their hearing quality after stapedotomy.
   Conclusions: Our case study confirms that stapedotomy is a safe and successful procedure providing long-term hearing improvement in primary otosclerosis. Obliterative otosclerosis, biscuit or floating footplate, monopodal stapes, anomalous facial nerve and persistent stapedial artery may be special scenarios encountered during stapedotomy and they need judicious management by an experienced surgeon. Our study shows that meticulous selection of cases for stapedotomy will result in highly successful audiological outcomes.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to analyze the clinical features of patients who underwent surgery for secondary acquired cholesteatoma (SAC).
   Materials and methods: The subjects were 30 patients who underwent surgery for SAC in 30 ears. We investigated the age distribution, sex, tympanic membrane (TM) findings, temporal bone pneumatization, morphology of TM epidermis invasion, extent of cholesteatoma invasion, ossicular erosion, surgical methods and surgical results.
   Results: There were 10 males (33.3%) and 20 females (66.6%), with a mean age 54.9 years. The TM perforation was medium-sized or larger in 27 ears (90%). Temporal bone pneumatization was poor or bad in 90% (18/20) of the evaluated ears. The cholesteatoma invaded from the malleus manubrium to the promontory in 23 ears (76.7%). There were no patients in whom the cholesteatoma invaded the antrum or mastoid. The ossicles were affected in 19 ears (63.3%). Ossiculoplasty with a columella on the stapes was the most frequent procedure, performed for 16 ears (53.3%). There were no hearing results with a postoperative air-bone gap of more than 31 dB.
   Conclusions: Although SAC is rare, it is important for the clinician to keep this type of cholesteatoma in mind. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: We investigated the outcomes of the endoscopic versus microscopic approach to type 1 tympanoplasty in pediatric patients.
   Methods: In this retrospective study, the outcomes of 61 ears of 60 pediatric patients (33 male and 27 female) who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty were evaluated. One patient underwent a bilateral operation. The age range of the patients was 7-16 years. Group 1 underwent tympanoplasty with an endoscopic technique (n = 32), and Group 2 underwent tympanoplasty with the conventional microscopic technique (n = 29). A boomerang-shaped chondroperichondrial graft was used in both groups. The outcomes were analyzed in terms of the hearing gain, duration of surgery, and graft success rate.
   Results: In both groups, the postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was significantly lower than the preoperative ABG. There were no significant differences between the preoperative and postoperative ABG values (in dB) in either group. The mean operative duration in Group 1 was significantly lower than that in Group 2 (51.37 vs. 67.03 min, respectively). In the preoperative evaluation, 65.6% of patients in Group 1 had larger perforations and 34.4% had smaller perforations. In Group 2, 58.6% and 41.3% of patients had larger and smaller perforations, respectively. Perforations were detected in two (6.25%), four (12.50%), and four (12.50%) of the patients in Group 1 at postoperative months 1, 6, and 12, respectively. Perforations were detected in two (5.71%) patients in Group 2 at postoperative months 1, 6, and 12. At 12 months postoperatively, there were smaller perforations in four (12.5%) of the children in Group 1 and in two (5.71%) of the children in Group 2. The difference between the perforation conditions (larger vs. smaller) was not significant in either group. The preoperative and postoperative increases in the ABG were associated. The operative duration was shorter in Group 1 than in Group 2.
   Conclusion: In pediatric patients undergoing type 1 tympanoplasty, especially if the external ear canal is narrow and the anterior canal wall is prominent, the endoscopic and microscopic approaches appear to give equal results in terms of easy visualization of the entire tympanic membrane and no requirement for extra intervention to evaluate the ossicular system. A shorter operative duration is an advantage of the endoscopic tympanoplasty technique. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to ascertain the feasibility of transcanal endoscopic underlay myringoplasty using temporalis fascia and compare the results with microscopic myringoplasty. This prospective randomized trial included 60 patients with mucosal chronic otitis media with tympanic membrane perforations of all sizes and locations apart from posteriorly based small or moderate sized perforations. In the endoscopy group, 30 patients underwent exclusive transcanal myringoplasty using tympanomeatal flap elevation with underlay graft placement. In the microscopy group, 30 patients underwent myringoplasty using the postaural approach. Intra-operative variables compared were canalplasty and canal wall curettage for assessment of ossicular status. Graft uptake, hearing outcomes using pure tone audiometry and subjective cosmetic outcomes were assessed 24 weeks post-operatively and compared in the two groups. Resident feedback on the feasibility of endoscopic myringoplasty was obtained using a questionnaire. In the microscopy group, 5/30 patients required canalplasty due to canal overhangs and 4/30 required canal wall curettage for ossicular assessment, whereas none of the patients in the endoscopy group required these procedures. A graft uptake rate of 83.3 % was observed in both groups post-operatively after 24 weeks. Mean air-bone gap pre- and post-operatively in the endoscopy group was 28.5 and 18.13 dB, respectively, whereas these values were 32.4 and 16.9 dB, respectively, in the microscopy group. Subjective cosmetic outcomes were better in the endoscopy group. Resident feedback on endoscopic myringoplasty was positive. Endoscopic myringoplasty appears to be an effective alternative to microscopic myringoplasty and results in excellent hearing with good cosmetic outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To compare the patients who underwent surgery for congenital aural atresia (CAA) with congenital aural stenosis (CAS) for the stability of hearing results and complications during long-term follow-up. Design: Retrospective review. Study sample: Seventy-five CAA patients and fifty CAS patients who underwent congenital meatoplasty with canalplasty and tympanoplasty between 2007 and 2012. Results: Paired comparison analyses detected no significant difference in preoperative ABG but significant changes in postoperative ABG, ABG, the number of ABG < 30 dB and ABG < 10 dB between CAA and CAS. Complications such as postoperative stenosis, bony regrowth, external aural canal (EAC) infection, EAC eczema, total deaf, and lateralization of the tympanic membrane (TM) were observed in 61.3% of patients with CAA and 20% of patients with CAS. Chi square test detected significant differences in complications between patients with CAA and CAS (chi(2) = 20.73, p < 0.01). Conclusion: Meatoplasty with canalplasty and tympanoplasty in individuals with CAS can yield reliable and lasting positive hearing results with a low incidence of severe complications. The existence and preoperative condition of patients 'TM and EAC skin helped improve hearing results and decrease the incidence of complications. However, the final hearing results and complications required stricter indications for CAA patients.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: To evaluate modified coupling techniques of the Vibrant Soundbridge system in patients with mixed and conductive hearing loss and to compare it with conventional vibroplasty.
   Study Design: Retrospective study.
   Methods: Two different groups were evaluated: 1) nine cases of conventional incus vibroplasty in comparison with 2) nine patients with modified coupling of the floating mass transducer. In the modified coupling approach, the vibrant floating mass transducer was attached to 1) the stapes/oval window, 2) the round window, or 3) the drilled promontory bone (promontory fenestration window). In three patients, an additional ossiculoplasty was performed. Preoperative and postoperative aided and unaided pure-tone and free-field audiometry and Freiburg monosyllabic word test were used to assess hearing outcome.
   Results: Functional hearing gain obtained in patients with mixed and conductive hearing loss who underwent modified coupling was 39 dB. Patients with pure sensorineural hearing loss who received conventional incus coupling showed a functional hearing gain of 25 dB. Average functional gain was 41 dB in the oval window group, 45 dB in the round window group, and 30 dB in the promontory fenestration window group. Word recognition test revealed an average improvement of 51% and 21% in the modified and in the conventional approach, respectively.
   Conclusions: Modified vibroplasty is a safe and effective treatment for patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss. Coupling the floating mass transducer to the promontory bone (promontory fenestration window) is a viable option in chronically disabled ears if oval and round window coupling is not possible.

AB  - The objective of our study was to review retrospectively the clinical, radiological and therapeutic findings in 62 adults with acute mastoiditis treated at the ENT Department of Ferrara from 1992 to 2010. 62 adult cases fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: otoscopical evidence of co-existent or recent otitis media; postauricular swelling, erythema or tenderness; protrusion of the auricle; fever and/or significant radiological findings of mastoiditis. Conservative treatment comprehended antibiotic +/- A ventilation tube. Surgical procedures comprehended mastoidectomy or mastoido-tympanoplasty. The incidence of adult's mastoiditis in our district (0.99 cases/year/100.000 inhabitants) has maintained quite stable during the considered 19-year period. The typical clinical presentation was observed in 48 % of cases. Complications were meningitis (15 cases), meningo-encephalitis (1), meningitis associated with lateral sinus thrombosis (1), facial nerve paralysis (11), and labyrinthitis (8). In all cases except one, the facial palsy recovered completely and no mortality was observed due to these complications. Complete cure was obtained with conservative treatment in 69 % of uncomplicated cases and in 24 % of patients with intracranial complications. Mastoiditis in adults may present as the acute classical form, as well as latent forms which often have prolonged and insidious development followed by a rapid clinical deterioration. Clinical features are frequently atypical, while incidence of meningitis and other complications is still high particularly in the most elderly. Thus, great care is required from clinicians to make an early diagnosis in order to promote adequate treatment.

AB  - Background: Wideband acoustic immittance (WAI) measurements are a relatively new class of aural acoustic tests that have shown promise as useful tools for evaluating middle-ear status. A growing body of work has described WAI for infants, children, and adults with normal middle-ear function, but a relatively limited number of studies have investigated the influence of specific middle-ear disorders on WAI. Although emerging WAI research data show promising results, additional measurements from ears of patients with a variety of middle-ear disorders are needed.
   Purpose: The aims of the present study were to (1) obtain WAI data from patients with a variety of middle-ear conditions, (2) examine relationships between WAI data relative to standard audiometric tests, and (3) identify patterns or profiles in WAI data within and among patients with different middle-ear conditions.
   Research Design: A descriptive study.
   Study Sample: Participants included 30 children and two adults with a variety of middle-ear disorders who were recruited from clinical audiology settings.
   Data Collection/Analysis: Experimental ambient and tympanometric WAI data were gathered along with standard audiometric test data as part of clinical audiology appointments. Single-subject and small-group data sets for ears of patients with suspected otitis media with effusion (sOME), pressure equalization (PE) tubes, negative tympanometric peak pressure (TPP), tympanoplasty, and cerumen impaction were obtained. Qualitative analysis and descriptive statistics (means and percentiles) were used to characterize the data.
   Results: Group mean absorbance for ears in the sOME group was reduced across the majority of frequencies; absorbance for ears with negative TPP was also reduced, although to a lesser degree. Absorbance patterns for ears with PE tubes show even greater differences because of the effects of the tube and open middle-ear cavity. WAI from ears with a tympanoplasty and cerumen impaction was suggestive of middle-ear dysfunction in the presence of normal single-frequency tympanometry. Percentile (5th, 50th, and 95th) plots for absorbance and other WAI quantities of admittance level, admittance phase, and equivalent ear-canal volume calculated for the sOME, negative TPP, and PE tube groups showed distinctive profiles that might be useful for discrimination of different middle-ear pathologies. Quantities from wideband tympanometry, including 250- and 1000-Hz single-frequency admittance tympanometric data were also derived.
   Conclusions: WAI measurements for some middle-ear conditions were consistent with patterns and profiles previously reported in the literature. WAI profiles for other middle-ear conditions, which had not been previously reported in the literature, were presented. Relationships between WAI data and results of standard audiometric tests were generally consistent with expectations. However, in some cases, WAI measurements were suggestive of middle-ear dysfunction despite normal 226-Hz admittance tympanometric findings.

AB  - Objective: This prospective study describes the use of autologous conchal cartilage in retracted tympanic membranes in children. METHODS: The setting is a tertiary ENT referral centre. All patients were screened from schools, aged between 4 and 14 years, who had limited cholesteatoma of mesotympanum, not extending to the mastoid antrum. On exploration, the postero superior quadrant was exposed after trans canal drilling; the retracted TM was excised piecemeal. The resulting bony defect was reconstructed with harvested conchal cartilage, in the same setting. This cartilage prevents recurrence of retraction. The graft on contact with the stapes head gave an added benefit of hearing gain, in spite of the incus being eroded and its remnant being removed. RESULTS: 20 of the 24 ears operated were available for follow- up. Of these20 cases, 15 had post op Air-bone gap (ABG) of <= 20dB (75%). There was no extrusion and no case of worsening of hearing. The mean hearing gain was 11.75 dB. CONCLUSION: The authors are satisfied with the outcome of using conchal cartilage to reconstruct postero superior bony defect, after limited cholesteatoma surgery. This cartilage simulates the curvature of the TM. This is done in the same sitting, and in the 13.6 months follow-up available, promises to be a reliable method in our experience.

AB  - Objective: Post-auricular approach is commonly used in otologic surgery. The objective of this study was to ascertain whether post-auricular approach alters the position of the auricle.
   Methods: All patients who underwent post-auricular approach for mastoidectomy or tympanoplasty from October 2010 to June 2012 were enrolled. Measurements of ear prominence at three distinct sites were taken preoperatively, and postoperatively at day one and at three and 12 months. Data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA analysis.
   Results: Nineteen patients were included in the study. Mean age at surgery was 9.05 years; 11 were male and 8 were female. Overall, there was no statistically significant long-term postoperative change in any of the three measurements, indicating stability of the auricular position. No difference was also noted on the basis of patient variables.
   Conclusion: Post-auricular approach did not alter the position of the external ear in our patient population. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to determine the anatomic and functional results of cartilage Type 1 tympanoplasty in children and to evaluate the success of surgery with parental perceptions.
   Methods: Only pediatric patients who had undergone cartilage Type 1 tympanoplasty were included in this study. Patients older than 16 years and patients who had otorrhoea during the previous month, chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and patients who had undergone mastoidectomy or ossiculopasty were excluded. The 'anatomical' success was accepted as an intact graft in the last control in the at least 6th month postoperatively. A satisfaction questionnaire with four questions about the perceptual results of surgical intervention was applied to the patients' parents on the telephone.
   Results: In total, 44 ears of 41 cases (22 male 19 female) were included in the study. The mean age was 13.2 +/- 2.7 (8-16) and the mean follow-up time was 17 (7-36) months. Anatomical success rate was 88.6% (39/44). As a preoperative mean, the pure tone hearing threshold was 30.7 +/- 7.7 dB and the postoperative mean pure-tone hearing threshold was 18.8 +/- 7.8 dB. Among the operated ears, 88.6% (39/44) of the perforations were treated successfully. Of the 41 paediatric patients' parents, only 28 (68.2%) could be reached by telephone; nineteen (68%) of the 28 parents contacted thought that the hearing level had improved postoperatively and only 10 parents (35%) stated that his/her child could attend a preoperatively-restricted activity postoperatively.
   Conclusion: Outcomes of cartilage tympanoplasty in children satisfy both surgeons and parents. Chronic otitis media in children must be managed with surgery as soon as favourable conditions are provided.

AB  - Purpose of reviewA review of recent publications is combined with our clinical experience to provide salient tips for optimizing the care of children with congenital cholesteatoma.Recent findingsIncreasing utilization of surgical adjuncts such as endoscopy and KTP laser provides the opportunity to improve postoperative outcomes by reducing residual cholesteatoma rates and improving hearing outcomes. Nevertheless, the best prospect of leaving the child with a normal ear is achieved by prompt removal after early detection when the lesion is still small.SummaryEducation of primary care providers to promote early identification and referral of congenital cholesteatoma remains an important objective and responsibility for otolaryngologists in order to obtain optimal outcome.

AB  - Objective: Repair surgery of cleft lip and palate (CLP) can produce satisfactory cosmetic results but the problem of recurrent otitis media with effusion (OME) secondary to CLP may persist. This can cause long-term hearing loss and affect linguistic, academic, and personal development. The aim of this review is to provide the most recent information regarding OME in children with CLP.
   Methods: All papers referring to children with CLP and OME were identified from searches in Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Abstracts were read and relevant papers were obtained. Additional studies were obtained from the references of the selected articles.
   Results: Both current and previous research on OME in children with CLP focused on the controversy over treatment strategies. Evidence on the optimal treatment for OME in CLP children was lacking. Ventilation tube surgery using the same anesthetic as lip or palate procedures was not well-supported. After summarizing the literature review, a flowchart of management guidance for such patients is also recommended. Updated reviews such as this will provide clinicians and patients/parents with a valuable reference.
   Conclusions: The lack of evidence on the optimal treatment for OME in children with CLP should prompt a relatively conservative approach. However, only a consensus between patients/parents and surgeons regarding the most suitable treatment strategy for OME can ensure the greatest benefit to individual patients.

AB  - Epstein syndrome is a rare disease which is accompanied by nephritis, sensorineural hearing impairment and macrothrombocytopenia. It has been suggested that this syndrome is a hereditary disease associated with mutations in MYH9, which encodes non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA. We report a case of a patient with Epstein syndrome in whom bilateral profound hearing impairment developed and who had undergone cochlear implantation 9 years previously. Prior to this, the patient showed progressive sensorineural hearing impairment and had become completely deaf by the age of 25. A cochlear implant was successfully used with a speech discrimination score of 98% (sentence test). However, in the present case, pen- and postoperative complications occurred: tympanic perforation remained after a promontory stimulation test, followed by transitory otitis with purulent discharge. Therefore, tympanoplasty was performed simultaneously with cochlear implantation. These complications were considered to be caused by platelet dysfunction and delayed wound healing. Furthermore, cochlear destruction was observed 8 years postoperatively. In Epstein syndrome, the mechanism of osseous change remains uncertain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of Epstein syndrome in a patient with long-term use of a CI. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Description and evaluation of a newly developed artificial temporal bone (TB) model suitable for surgical training for cochlear implantation.
   Subject: Based on micro-computed tomographic images, a TB model was designed with material properties as similar to bone as possible. The bony anatomic details were rebuilt as closely as possible with preservation of the endocochlear lumen.
   Intervention: The TB model was compared with a human cadaveric TB by 8 otologists experienced in cochlear implantation.
   Main Outcome Measure: The otologists were asked to respond to a semiquantitative questionnaire with scales from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Anatomic details were compared macroscopically and microscopically. The surgical steps of mastoidectomy, posterior tympanotomy, cochleostomy, and insertion of a cochlear electrode were assessed.
   Results: The material properties and anatomic details of the TB model were generally comparable to the human TB. One exception was the round window membrane, which was not modeled appropriately. The surgical steps, including the insertion of the electrode, were rated as comparable.
   Conclusion: The TB model is suitable for surgical training for interventions such as cochlear implantation. It cannot replace cadaveric human temporal bones completely, but it provides an easily available alternative to train and develop surgical skills. A wider variety of anatomic models, such as an infant's TB or malformations, will increase the value of TB models.

AB  - To investigate whether keratinocytes proliferate in response to epiregulin produced by subepithelial fibroblasts derived from middle ear cholesteatoma. Tissue samples were obtained from patients undergoing tympanoplasty. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine epiregulin expression and localization in cholesteatoma tissues and retroauricular skin tissues. Fibroblasts were cultured from cholesteatoma tissues and from normal retroauricular skin. These fibroblasts were used as feeder cells for culture with a human keratinocyte cell line (PHK16-0b). To investigate the role of epiregulin in colony formation by PHK16-0b cells, epiregulin mRNA expression was knocked down in fibroblasts by using short interfering RNA and epiregulin protein was blocked with a neutralizing antibody. Epiregulin mRNA expression was significantly elevated in cholesteatoma tissues compared with that in normal retroauricular skin. Staining for epiregulin was more intense in the epithelial cells and subepithelial fibroblasts of cholesteatoma tissues than in retroauricular skin. When PHK16-0b cells were cultured with cholesteatoma fibroblasts, their colony-forming efficiency was 50% higher than when these cells were cultured with normal skin fibroblasts. Also, knockdown of epiregulin mRNA in cholesteatoma fibroblasts led to greater suppression of colony formation than knockdown in skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, the colony-forming efficiency of PHK16-0b cells was significantly reduced after treatment with an epiregulin neutralizing antibody in co-culture with cholesteatoma fibroblasts, but not in co-culture with skin fibroblasts. These results suggest that keratinocyte hyperproliferation in cholesteatoma is promoted through overexpression of epiregulin by subepithelial fibroblasts via epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, which may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma.

AB  - Objective: To perform a contemporary review of experimental studies to describe the effects of various novel adjuvant therapies in enhancing tympanic membrane (TM) perforation healing.
   Methods: A PubMed search for articles from January 2000 to June 2012 related to TM perforation, along with the references of those articles, was performed. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to all experimental studies assessing adjuvant therapies to TM healing.
   Results: Many studies have assessed the efficacy of biomolecules or growth factors, such as epidermal growth factors and basic fibroblast growth factors, in TM regeneration with significant success. More recent strategies in TM tissue engineering have involved utilizing bioengineered scaffold materials, such as silk fibroin, chitosan, calcium alginate, and decellularized extracellular matrices. Most scaffold materials demonstrated biocompatibility and faster TM perforation healing rates.
   Conclusion: Although several studies have demonstrated promising results, many questions still remain, such as the adequacy of animal models and long-term biocompatibility of adjuvant materials. As well, further studies comparing various adjuvant substances and bioscaffolds are required prior to clinical application. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Chronic tympanic membrane perforations can cause significant morbidity. The term myringoplasty describes the operation used to close such perforations. A variety of graft materials are available for use in myringoplasty, but all have limitations and few studies report post-operative hearing outcomes. Recently, the biomedical applications of silk fibroin protein have been studied. This material's biocompatibility, biodegradability and ability to act as a scaffold to support cell growth prompted an investigation of its interaction with human tympanic membrane keratinocytes.
   Methods and materials: Silk fibroin membranes were prepared and human tympanic membrane keratinocytes cultured. Keratinocytes were seeded onto the membranes and immunostained for a number of relevant protein markers relating to cell proliferation, adhesion and specific epithelial differentiation.
   Results: The silk fibroin scaffolds successfully supported the growth and adhesion of keratinocytes, whilst also maintaining their cell lineage.
   Conclusion: The properties of silk fibroin make it an attractive option for further research, as a potential alternative graft in myringoplasty.

AB  - The tympanic membrane (TM), separating the external and middle ear, consists of fibrous connective tissue sandwiched between epithelial layers. To treat chronic ear infections, tympanostomy drainage tubes are placed in surgically created holes in TMs which can become chronic perforations upon extrusion. Perforations are repaired using a variety of techniques, but are limited by morbidity, unsatisfactory closure rates, or minimal regeneration of the connective tissue. A more effective, minimally-invasive therapy is necessary to enhance the perforation closure rate. Current research utilizing decellularized or alignate materials moderately enhance closure but the native TM architecture is not restored. Poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is a biocompatible elastomer which supports cell migration and enzymatically degrades in contact with vascularized tissue. PGS spool-shaped plugs were manufactured using a novel process. Using minimally invasive procedures, these elastomeric plugs were inserted into chronic chinchilla TM perforations. As previously reported, effective perforation closure occurred as both flange surfaces were covered by confluent cell layers; >90% of perforations were closed at 6-week postimplantation. This unique in vivo environment has little vascularized tissue. Consequently, PGS degradation was minimal over 16-week implantation, hindering regeneration of the TM fibrous connective tissue. PGS degradation must be enhanced to promote complete TM regeneration. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Biomed Mater Res Part B: Appl Biomater, 2012.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the microsurgical skills training on a tympanoplasty model with regard to the learning curve and the participants' motivation for a surgical specialty.
   Study Design: Randomized controlled prospective study.
   Setting: Department of Otolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery, Medical Campus Carl Gustav Carus at the Technische Universitat Dresden, Germany.
   Subjects: Thirty randomly chosen fifth-year medical students divided into 2 groups.
   Interventions: Group 2 (n = 16) had to perform an ossicular and tympanic membrane reconstruction on a tympanoplasty model on Days 1, 7, 14, and 21 and Group 1 (n = 14) on Days 1 and 21, while observing the procedure at Days 7 and 14. Six otosurgeons served as gold standard. Attempts and time of prosthesis placement and time for tympanic membrane reconstruction were recorded. Tremor frequency and amplitude were obtained at the same time points. An adjusted study interest questionnaire was used to assess students' motivation.
   Results: Students in Group 2 showed a significant improvement in all reconstruction parameters over the study period compared with both, baseline measurement on first day and Group 1. However, the obtained learning curve did not reach the experts level. Tremor indices and students' motivation showed no correlation with the reconstruction parameters, whereas the training itself had a positive impact on students' interest in the surgical specialty.
   Conclusion: Training with the tympanoplasty model is suitable to acquire first microsurgical motor skills in otolaryngology and to arouse students' interest in the surgical field and otorhinolaryngology.

AB  - Objectives: To visualize the distribution of galectin-7 in middle ear cholesteatomas using an immunofluorescent method and to establish whether galectin-7 can be used as a marker of cholesteatoma residue at the time of operation.
   Methods: Middle ear cholesteatomas were obtained at surgery from 30 patients. Samples were frozen and preserved in a freezer until histological study. After serial sectioning with a cryostat, 2 of the specimens were processed with primary antibody and Zenon rabbit immunoglobulin G labeling kits. After sufficient reaction time, the samples were observed using a confocal laser microscope. In the remaining 28 specimens, the cholesteatoma was treated as 1 block and stained with the same solution. It was then observed using a fluorescent stereomicroscope.
   Results: Confocal microscopic analyses showed that galectin-7 was distributed in the cholesteatoma matrix. Because this area strongly stained green, it was easily recognized using a confocal laser microscope. In the stereomicroscopic study using the 1-block specimen in which the cholesteatoma was processed together with the surrounding granulation and mucosal tissue, only the matrix and overlying debris was yellow-green in response to excitation by light; the surrounding granulation and mucosal tissues did not respond in 7 specimens. In the remaining 21 specimens, the whole sample was composed of cholesteatoma and responded well to excitation by light. These findings suggest that galectin-7 might be a useful marker of cholesteatoma residue that can be visualized using this immunofluorescent method.
   Conclusion: Because residual cholesteatoma matrix is considered to be one of the main causes of cholesteatoma recurrence, staining with galectin-7 at the time of operation would be a promising way to facilitate complete removal of the residue.

AB  - Tympanic membrane (TM) perforation is still one of the most common otology complications. New designs of biomaterials, and lately tissue-engineered composites and grafts, have thoroughly revolutionized the management of TM perforation. In this study, we examined a biologically modified collagen-immobilized polydimethyl siloxane patch to repair TM perforation. In vitro potential of the aforementioned patch as a scaffold to support fibroblast cell growth and adhesion was assessed. An in vivo assay of the patch for initiating repair of TM perforations also was investigated. In vitro assay showed that the patch has significantly increased cell adhesion and growth in comparison with unmodified ones (p < 0.05). In vivo study also showed an overall closure rate of TM perforation of 70% and an average gain of 15.75 +/- 4.29 dB in air-bone gap. This study shows that the preliminary in vivo evaluation of a modified siloxane patch in humans had promising results and is comparable to existing biomaterial patches.

AB  - Impact of Transtympanic Miniature Endoscopy of the Middle Ear - A Conceptual Cadaver Study
   Background: Endoscopic inspections of the middle ear have already been described. So far, the low optical quality due to the small diameter is limiting this type of procedure. In this study the use of a miniature endoscope for visualization of the middle ear structures has been evaluated.
   Material and Methods: 8 human cadaveric head specimens have been inspected. Following myringotomy, 2 miniature endoscopes were placed into the middle ear and the promontory, the incudostapedial joint, the round und oval window niche with stapes footplate were visualized and fotodocumentated. After endaural approach all middle ear structures were visualized microscopically and the quality of pictures was compared. Technical picture quality and anatomical visualization were evaluated by 5 ear surgeons. In addition, 2 interventional procedures were performed (control of ossicular chain mobility and intratympanic substance application).
   Results: Still, the technical picture quality was significantly better for the microscope. The anatomical visualization of the middle ear structures with the miniature endoscope was not inferior compared to the microscope. The feasibility of additional interventions, e.g. control of ossicular chain mobility or intratympanic substance application could be shown. An inspection of the correct prothesis position after tympanoplasty could be evaluated, too.
   Conclusion: This study showed that middle ear structures can be visualized by trans-tympanic miniature endoscopy equal or even better compared to conventional microscopy in spite of reduced technical quality.

TI  - Multiple Osteomas in Middle Ear
T2  - CASE REPORTS IN OTOLARYNGOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Since the first description of middle ear osteomas by Thomas in 1964, only few reports were published within the English literatures (Greinwalid et al., 1998; Shimizu et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2005; and Jang et al., 2009), and only one case of the multiple osteomas in middle ear was described by Kim et al., 2006, which arose from the promontory, lateral semicircular canal, and epitympanum. Here we describe a patient with multiple middle ear osteomas arising from the promontory, incus, Eustachian tube, and bony semicanal of tensor tympani muscle. This patient also contracted the chronic otitis media in the ipsilateral ear. The osteomas were successfully removed by performing type III tympanoplasty in one stage.

AB  - Background: The training of microsurgical motor skills is essentiell for surgical education if the interests of the patient are to be safeguarded. In otosurgery the complex anatomy of the temporal bone and variations necessitate a special training before performing surgery on a patient. We therefore developed and evaluated a simplified middle ear model for acquiring first microsurgical skills in tympanoplasty.
   Methods: The simplified tympanoplasty model consists of the outer ear canal and a tympanic cavity. A stapes model is placed in projection of the upper posterior tympanic membrane quadrant at the medial wall of the simulated tympanic cavity. To imitate the annular ligament flexibility the stapes is fixed on a soft plastic pad. 41 subjects evaluated the model's anatomical analogy, the comparability to the real surgical situation and the general model properties the using a special questionnaire.
   Results and Conclusions: The tympanoplasty model was very well evaluated by all participants. It is a reasonably priced model and a useful tool in microsurgical skills training. Thereby, it closes the gap between theoretical training and real operation conditions.

AB  - Stapedotomies are perfomed with the aid of surgical microscopes. However, the microscope has some limitations and may cause complications such as damage to the chorda tympani nerve. There are just a few cases and no series published on the use of sino-nasal endoscopes in stapedotomies.
   Objectives: a) To investigate the feasibility of using sino-nasal endoscopes in stapedotomies, focusing on the visualization of important structures. b) To show initial results, discuss possible advantages and disadvantages of this instrument.
   Methods: 15 patients with otosclerosis were selected to undergo stapedotomies in 2010. The data and surgery videos were analyzed retrospectively (study case series). The anatomical conditions of the oval window niche and surgical steps were described and used to assess possible benefits of such procedures.
   Results: The surgeries were performed with endoscopes only and all relevant anatomical structures were visualized without difficulty. No complications were observed and 14 of the 15 patients reported improvement of their hearing, confirmed by postoperative audiological tests.
   Conclusion: Totally endoscopic stapes surgeries are technically feasible, safe and promising. In this small series, the main advantages were: virtually no trauma to the chorda tympani nerve and excellent vision. The disadvantages were the lack of stereoscopic vision, having to work with one hand only and the learning curve.

AB  - Objective: Management of tympanic membrane perforations is varied. Our goal is to better understand current practice patterns in myringoplasty and type 1 tympanoplasty.
   Methods: An electronic questionnaire was distributed to American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) members. Practice patterns were compared by fellowship training, practice length, practice setting, paediatric case frequency and total cases per year.
   Results: Among 321 respondents, most were comprehensive otolaryngologists (60.4%), in private practice (60.8%), with a primarily adult practice (59.8%). Fellowship training was the factor most associated with significant variations in management, including preoperative antibiotic usage (p=0.019), contraindications (p<0.001), approach to traumatic perforations (p<0.001), use of local anesthesia (p<0.001), graft material (p<0.001), tympanoplasty technique (p=0.003), endoscopic assistance (p<0.001), and timing of postoperative audiology evaluation (p=0.003).
   Conclusion: Subspecialty training appears to be the main variable associated with significant differences in perioperative decision making for surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforations.

AB  - Objective: A systematic review to determine whether the diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging scan can reliably detect residual or recurrent cholesteatoma after mastoid surgery.
   Design: A systematic review.
   Data Sources: Databases including EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Review were searched for studies published without language restriction from the start of the databases. Additional studies were identified from cited references.
   Selection Criteria: Initial search identified 402 publications, of which 16 studies met the inclusion criteria for the systematic review. The DW imaging (DWI) scan was used to detect residual or recurrent cholesteatoma and subsequent second-look surgery was performed to correlate the findings.
   Review Methods: Studies were assessed for their selection of patients for radiologic investigations, imaging parameters, and subsequent surgery. Outcome measures included sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of the DWI, and the incidence and size of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma.
   Results: Two different modalities of DWI sequences have been described. Eight studies with 225 patients analyzed echo-planar imaging (EPI) and 8 studies with 207 patients described the "non-EPI" scanning techniques. Non-EPI parameters are more reliable in identifying residual or recurrent cholesteatoma with sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of 91%, 96%, 97%, and 85%, respectively.
   Conclusion: The available evidence suggests that non-EPI such as half-Fourier acquisition single-shot turbo spin echo sequences are more reliable in identifying residual or recurrent cholesteatoma. This is a promising radiologic investigation; however, we think further studies are required with more patients and long-term results to establish its place as an alternative to a second-stage surgery after canal wall up surgery.

AB  - Cartilage has shown to be a promising graft material to close tympanic membrane perforations. However, due to its rigid quality, doubts are raised regarding its sound conduction properties. It has been suggested that acoustic benefit may be obtained by thinning the cartilage. We describe our innovative method for harvesting tragal cartilage from the same endaural incision and also describe preparation of the graft by slicing it. We present our 3-year experience of shield cartilage type 1 tympanoplasty using sliced tragal cartilage-perichondrium composite graft.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to prove the success rate of our technique of shield cartilage tympanoplasty using sliced tragal cartilage graft in terms of functional and anatomic results.
   Study design: Retrospective analysis of type 1 cartilage tympanoplasties using sliced tragal cartilage was carried out in MIMER Medical College and Sushrut ENT Hospital during May 2005 to January 2008 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years.
   Method and materials: A total of 223 ears were operated by our technique.
   Results: The overall success rate of our technique was 98.20% in terms of perforation closure and air bone gap closure within 7.06 +/- 3.39 dB. The success rates in the various age group are as follows: 11 to 20 years, 97.67%; 21 to 40 years, 99.12%; and 41 to 60 years, 96.96%.
   Conclusion: Our technique of type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty achieves good anatomic and functional results. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The incidence of fistulas found during the surgery for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma has been reported in a wide range in different geographical areas. This study aims to find the prevalence of labyrinthine fistula in the south of Iran.
   Methods: A prospective cross sectional study of 787 (504 ears belong to 462 patients) consecutive tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy for chronic otitis media was performed. Data on preoperative clinical and preoperative and postoperative hearing status and intraoperative findings were analyzed.
   Results: A labyrinthine fistula was found at surgery in 24 (4.7%) ears of the total 504 ears belonging to 462 patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media. Location of the fistula was the lateral semicircular canal in 23, posterior semicircular canal in 1 and promontory in 1 subject. There was a statistically significant difference in preoperative and postoperative AC threshold in 500-3000 Hz frequency and ABG 500-3000 Hz, but there was no statistically significant difference in the other variables.
   Conclusion: Regarding postoperative hearing outcome in the labyrinthine fistula surgery, it seems that there is no universal method of reporting of hearing results. Past hearing evaluation methods in the literature have been often poorly comparable, based on different methodology.

AB  - Purpose of review
   A host of synthetically engineered materials have come to market in the past three decades, changing the way surgical reconstruction is performed. Although tissue engineering holds the promise of true tissue replacement, this technology is years away from true clinical use. In the interim, understanding of the current synthetic bone substitutes will be reviewed to provide the clinician with an updated understanding of the different classes along with advantages, disadvantages and novel applications.
   Recent findings
   A discussion of currently used bone cements, scaffolds, bone matrices and growth factors will be included. In addition, a sampling of exciting basic science experiments and preliminary treatments for synthetic bone reconstruction is covered.
   Summary
   Each reconstructive surgeon should have a comprehensive understanding of the current technologies to optimize reconstruction of bony defects. As this field is rapidly changing, new iterations arrive yearly, which possess improved osteoconductive, osteoinductive, osteointegrative and osteogenic properties. A better understanding of these new products and material will allow each reconstructive surgeon the ability to provide patients with the safest and most successful reconstruction.

AB  - Objective: To present power stapes, stapedotomy, and middle ear implantation with Vibrant SoundBridge (VSB) performed in a one-step surgery as an alternative option for hearing rehabilitation in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI).
   Study Design: Retrospective case series.
   Setting: Tertiary referral ear center.
   Patients: A family with genetically proven OI Type I.
   Interventions: Two patients, mother and son, with severe to profound mixed hearing loss underwent 3 power stapes, 1 unilateral and 1 bilateral sequential.
   Main Outcome Measures: Thorough audiological diagnostic batteries including aided and unaided pure-tone and free-field audiometry and Freiburg monosyllabic word test were used to assess the preoperative status and the postoperative hearing outcome. High-resolution computed tomography of the temporal bones was performed as well. Surgical procedure and any special considerations were analyzed in detail.
   Results: The hearing outcome was favorable in all cases, showing in comparison to the preoperative values an average improvement of 36.8 dB. Severe intraoperative bleeding of the middle ear mucosa was the only complication and could be easily controlled by allowing short time intervals. Inner ear trauma did not occur in any case.
   Conclusion: Power stapes represents a safe and promising procedure for treating hearing loss in selected patients with OI. Furthermore, it introduces a new, advantageous VSB application in cases of mixed hearing loss with severe otosclerosis and increased bone-conduction thresholds.

AB  - DWI is a useful technique for the evaluation of cholesteatomas. It can be used to detect them when the physical examination is difficult and CT findings are equivocal, and it is especially useful in the evaluation of recurrent cholesteatoma. Initial DWI techniques only detected larger cholesteatomas, >5 mm, due to limitations of section thickness and prominent skull base artifacts. Newer techniques allow detection of smaller lesions and may be sufficient to replace second-look surgery in patients with prior cholesteatoma resection.

AB  - The relevant aspects of cholesteatomas are reviewed with the emphasis on their diagnosis by using cross-sectional imaging. The indications and limitations of CT and MR imaging and the use of novel MR imaging techniques in the diagnosis of cholesteatomas are described. HRCT of the temporal bone has an excellent spatial resolution, thus even small soft-tissue lesions can be accurately delineated (high sensitivity). However, CT has poor specificity lie, soft-tissue structures cannot be differentiated). MR imaging with the conventional sequences (T1WI, T2WI, postcontrast T1WI) provides additional information for distinguishing different pathologic entities and for accurately diagnosing primary (nonsurgical) and residual/recurrent (surgical) cholesteatomas. Higher diagnostic specificity is achieved by introducing DW-EPI, delayed postcontrast imaging, DW-non-EPI, and DWI-PROPELLER techniques. Studies using DW-non-EPI and DWI-PROPELLER sequences show promising results related to improved diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for even small (<5 mm) cholesteatomas, thus allowing avoidance of second-look surgery in the future.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the influence of our technique of partial mastoid obliteration with autologous bone pate covered by cartilage plates on vestibular stimulation.
   Methods: Twenty-six patients who were treated for recurrent chronic otitis media by revision canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy and subsequent partial obliteration were invited for follow-up; 18 patients agreed to a complete follow-up including vestibular testing. Patients received questionnaires for evaluating preoperative and postoperative symptoms associated with vertigo. Examination comprised otomicroscopy, pure-tone audiometry, and caloric testing.
   Results: Mean follow-up was 6 years. Before surgery, 54% of the patients reported vertigo on caloric stimuli such as wind, water, or suction cleaning of the tympanomastoid cavity. In all patients, these symptoms were suspended after partial mastoid obliteration. The postoperative obliterated cavity volume aver-aged 3.1 ml. All cavities after surgery appeared completely epithelialized and dry. The postoperative caloric vestibular tests revealed an average nystagmus count of 46 beats per minute compared with 72 beats before surgery. Thus, the partial mastoid cavity obliteration led to a mean nystagmus reduction of 36% in our study group.
   Conclusion: Our technique of partially obliterating tympanomastoid cavities with autologous bone pate being covered by cartilage plates results in small cavities with complete epithelialization of all surfaces. Furthermore, obliteration of mastoid cavities confers protection to the labyrinthine organ, thereby reducing postoperative vertigo on caloric stimulation.

AB  - This article describes a surgical robotic device that is able to discriminate tissue interfaces and other controlling parameters ahead of the drill tip. The advantage in such a surgery is that the tissues at the interfaces can be preserved. A smart tool detects ahead of the tool point and is able to control the interaction with respect to the flexing tissue, to avoid penetration or to control the extent of protrusion with respect to the position of the tissue. For surgical procedures, where precision is required, the tool offers significant benefit. To interpret the drilling conditions and the conditions leading up to breakthrough at a tissue interface, a sensing scheme is used that discriminates between the variety of conditions posed in the drilling environment. The result is a fully autonomous system, which is able to respond to the tissue type, behaviour, and deflection in real-time. The system is also robust in terms of disturbances encountered in the operating theatre. The device is pragmatic. It is intuitive to use, efficient to set up, and uses standard drill bits. The micro-drill, which has been used to prepare cochleostomies in the theatre, was used to remove the bone tissue leaving the endosteal membrane intact. This has enabled the preservation of sterility and the drilling debris to be removed prior to the insertion of the electrode. It is expected that this technique will promote the preservation of hearing and reduce the possibility of complications. The article describes the device (including simulated drill progress and hardware set-up) and the stages leading up to its use in the theatre.

AB  - An experimental study was undertaken to investigate the use of a CO2 laser welding technique in myringoplasty. Albumin solder was used to fix a temporal fascia graft via an overlay transcanal approach. The results of the operative procedure were assessed by microscopic and histopathologic examination over an interval of 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks postoperatively. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight adult guinea pigs were divided into two groups after permanent perforation of the tympanic membrane was created: laser-assisted myringoplasty group and surgical myringoplasty group. Laser beam power was 0.4 W, pulse duration 0.75 s, pulse interval 0.1 s and spot size 250 mu m. Each experimental group was further subdivided into four subgroups of 6 animals each. Histological and microscopic findings of the tympanic membrane for both groups after 1, 2, 3, and 4 weeks were compared. Results: Microscopic examination of the tympanic membrane showed high success rate in the laser-assisted myringoplasty group compared to the control group. Histological evaluation for the tympanic membrane showed complete repair of the tympanic membrane in the laser-assisted myringoplasty group. Conclusion: Laser-assisted myringoplasty using CO2 might be a promising new method in surgical myringoplasty. Copyright (C) 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Goals: To assess the effects of thickness and position of cartilage used to reconstruct the tympanic membrane (TM) using a novel technique, time-averaged laser holography.
   Background: Cartilage is commonly used in TM reconstruction to prevent formation of retraction pockets. The thickness, position, and shape of the cartilage graft may adversely affect TM motion and hearing. We sought to systematically investigate these parameters in an experimental setting.
   Methods: Computer-assisted optoelectronic laser holography was used in 4 human cadaveric temporal bones to study sound-induced TM motion for 500 Hz to 8 kHz. Stapes velocity was measured with a laser Doppler vibrometer. Baseline (control) measurements were made with the TM intact. Measurements were repeated after a 0.5- or 1.0-mm-thick oval piece of conchal cartilage was placed on the medial TM surface in the posterior-superior quadrant. The cartilage was rotated so that it was either in contact with the bony tympanic rim and manubrium or not.
   Results: At frequencies less than 4 kHz, the cartilage graft had only minor effects on the overall TM fringe patterns. The different conditions had no effects on stapes velocity. Greater than 4 kHz, TM motion was reduced over the grafted TM, both with 0.5- and 1.0-mm-thick grafts. No significant differences in stapes velocity were seen with the 2 different thicknesses of cartilage compared with control.
   Conclusion: Computer-assisted optoelectronic laser holography is a promising technique to investigate middle ear mechanics after tympanoplasty. Such positioning may prevent postoperative TM retraction. These findings and conclusions apply to cartilage placed in the posterior-superior TM quadrant.

AB  - Objectives: First, to assess for the performance of the Carina placed on the round window at various European centers; second, to study the follow-up after 2 years and discuss limitations and technical issues; and finally, to further develop our understanding of the principles of acoustic transfer through the round window.
   Materials and Methods: Eleven patients were included in this retrospective study (7 women and 4 men) from 7 European tertiary referral hospitals (4 centers in France, 2 in Belgium, 1 in Spain). The mean age was 50.8 years (35-71 yr). All patients have multiple previous surgeries (93 surgical procedures) for otosclerosis (3 patients) or chronic otitis media (8 patients), and in all cases, the stapes was not accessible due to obliteration by sclerotic tissue. Preoperative and postoperative air conduction, bone conduction, as well as aided and unaided thresholds and speech scores were measured.
   Results: No significant differences were observed between pre-operative and postoperative air-conduction and bone-conduction pure-tone averages. The average free field functional gain obtained with the implant ranged from 22 to 42 dB at each individual frequency, with a mean of 29 T 5 dB across all audiometric frequencies. Word recognition scores demonstrated significant differences between unaided and implant-aided conditions. Complications included 2 cases of postoperative infection (including 1 anacusis) that required explantation, and 1 case reduced initial benefit, followed by a nonfunctioning device. In 10 patients, postoperative hearing was unchanged. The 8 other patients are using their implant daily.
   Conclusion: These results show that this option is valid for patients with a fixed footplate and unsuccessful previous surgeries or patients who cannot benefit from a stapedotomy for anatomic reasons. In some cases, access to the round window membrane could represent a limitation. However, these promising initial results establish the need for further works with regard to 3 issues: 1) clinical data studies are needed, including a greater number of patients to confirm these preliminary results; 2) a long-term follow-up must be performed to detect any possible cochlear adverse effects, in particular, on the basilar membrane; 3) the effect of fascia interposition and tip size has to be evaluated in experimental studies.

AB  - Tinnitus is a public health issue in France. Around 1% of the population is affected and 30,000 people are handicapped in their daily life. The treatments available for disabling tinnitus have until now been disappointing. We are reporting on the surgical treatment by electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex of a female patient affected by disabling tinnitus that resisted classical treatments. The tinnitus appeared suddenly 10 years ago after a left ear tympanoplasty. The acouphenometry measures revealed a bilateral tinnitus, predominant on the right side, constant, with high frequency (6000 Hz). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed at first with several supraliminal and infraliminal protocols. This showed promising results. Anatomic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the auditory cortex before and after repetitive TMS (rTMS) demonstrated a modification of the conical activity and where the ideal location for a cortical electrode might be, to straddle primary and secondary auditory cortex. After these investigations, two quadra polar electrodes (Resume, Medtronic Ltd, Hertfordshire, UK), connected to a stimulating device implanted under the skin (Synergy, Medtronic Ltd), were extradurally implanted. The surgical procedure was similar to the one performed for analgesic cortical stimulation. No surgical complications were reported. The activation of the stimulator provided a reduction of 65% of the tinnitus impact, with a persistent effect on the right side. The feasibility of the conical stimulation in symptomatic treatment of tinnitus was proven by this preparatory work. The middle- and long-term therapeutic effects remain to be evaluated.

AB  - The authors describe a case of bilateral promontory fistula due to noncholesteatomatous chronic otitis media in a 46-year-old male. We performed both open cavity mastoidectomy and left staged ossiculoplasty. One year postoperatively, the audiogram showed an improved left air conduction threshold and maintenance of bone conduction. We suggest that noncholesteatomatous chronic otitis media can induce various destructive changes via the chronic inflammatory reaction.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: To test urinary bladder matrix (UBM) as a potential treatment for tympanic membrane (TM) healing and regeneration.
   Study Design: This prospective pilot study was designed to provide both qualitative and semiquantitative assessment of temporal and spatial healing events in the chinchilla model of chronic TM perforations with and without UBM patching.
   Methods: Bilateral myringotomies were performed and repeated as necessary to create subtotal perforations over an 8-week period. Myringoplasty was then performed, with left TMs serving as controls and right TMs receiving UBM patches. TMs were excised at 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks. Fixed tissue samples were characterized for gross morphology, then processed for microscopic evaluation.
   Results: Chronic perforations were maintained with one or more repeated myringotomies. Although both control and patched TMs were thicker than native tissue, patched TMs were transparent and uniform in thickness without any inclusions. UBM patches were readily degraded and replaced by newly deposited and organized host tissue that recapitulated the native TM layers.
   Conclusions: UBM scaffolds were an effective biological scaffold for TM closure and tissue remodeling, leading to thicker than normal anatomy but otherwise normal morphology. Future studies are required to determine functional and temporal outcomes as well as alternative patch orientations. The results show particular promise as a superior alternative means of reconstructing not only chronic TM perforations but also dimeric TMs associated with retraction pockets and atelectasis.

AB  - A surgical approach using the external auditory canal and the round window as a natural access pathway for cochlear implant positioning, the endomeatal approach, is described. This approach avoids performing an antromastoidectomy, the subsequent posterior tympanotomy and the promontorial cochleostomy. The endomeatal approach also allows an optimal insertion plane for electrode array atraumatic insertion through the round window.The technique was developed and practiced in 35 fresh temporal bones and then it was applied in ten patients. This surgery has an endomeatal first stage, which begins with a stapedectomy-like tympanomeatal flap. This flap allows an easy access to scala tympani via round window niche. The internal part of a groove is drilled on the posterior wall of the EAC. The groove is parallel to the EAC axis and starts in its inner border. Once the endomeatal stage is completed, a standard retroauricular approach is performed, in order to make the receptor-stimulator well and to complete the groove externally, until it connects the middle ear with the external mastoid surface. A flat second well is drilled in front of the first one to lodge the remaining electrode lead. In small children this well is deepened. The electrode array is introduced in the scala tympani through the RW and located into the groove. The electrode is covered and fixed inside the groove with bone pat,. The extra length of the electrode lead is located in the second well and the receptor-stimulator is fixed in its well. The ground electrode is placed under the periosteum, the retroauricular incision is sutured, the tympanomeatal flap is restored and a dressing is placed into the EAC. Surgical time was significantly shorter than in standard approach. There were neither surgical nor healing complications. Electrode insertion was easy and complete and functional results were adequate. The goal of this approach is to avoid antromastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy, which are replaced by the EAC groove. It is faster and safer, eliminating the risk of facial nerve injury. It also allows a better access to the round window, with a less traumatic electrode insertion, suitable for "soft surgery" performing. It may advantageously replace the classical transmastoideal approach.

AB  - Objectives: Diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is emerging as an alternative to second-look surgery in ruling out residual or recurrent disease after cholesteatoma eradication. However, the DW MRI appearances of postoperative or inflammatory mucosal changes have not been well investigated, thus rendering the interpretation of postoperative DW MRI difficult in the presence of mucosal reactions. We investigated the turbo-spin echo (TSE) DW MRI changes of the middle ear and mastoid mucosa after cholesteatoma surgery and compared these with the TSE DW MRI features of cholesteatoma with an aim to identify a rapid and cost-effective purely DW MRI sequence that can be used to screen for cholesteatoma.
   Study Design: A prospective comparative study.
   Setting: A tertiary referral center in Western Australia.
   Patients: Patients undergoing revision or second-look cholesteatoma surgery.
   Intervention: Patients underwent 3 to 6 monthly half-Fourier-acquisition single-shot turbo-spin-echo TSE DW MRI before their second surgery. The MRI findings were then correlated with the intraoperative findings at second-look surgery 6 to 17 months after primary surgery or of revision surgery in the cases that were referred from other centers.
   Main Outcome Measure: Detection of cholesteatoma and noncholesteatoma mucosal changes on TSE DW MRI, compared with the gold standard of findings at second surgery.
   Results: Twenty-two patients underwent 23 second-look or revision procedures. All patients had DW MRI before their "second-look" or revision surgery. TSE DW MRI detected cholesteatomas in 7 patients whom all had disease confirmed at second-look or revision surgery. In 16 cases shown to be negative on DW MRI for cholesteatoma, all were confirmed to be disease-free on second-look surgery. Cholesteatomas were shown to produce a TSE DW MRI signal clearly distinct from the spectrum of imaging findings encountered in postoperative mucosal changes.
   Conclusion: TSE DW MRI holds great promise in screening for cholesteatoma as an alternative to exploratory second-look surgery.

TI  - An Experimental Investigation into the Effects of Bacteria Exhibiting Acid Phosphatase Activity on Tympanosclerosis Plaques
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNATIONAL ADVANCED OTOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - Objective; We aimed to weaken structure of sclerotic plaques in tympanic cavity by using bacteria and fungi that decompose calcium and phosphate in calcium and phosphate crystals.
   Study Design; Experimental prospective in-vitro study.
   Materials & Methods; We used the sclerotic plaques extracted from 10 patients who had undergone tympanoplasty due to advanced tympanosclerosis. These plaques and ossicles taken from fresh cadavers and approximately 20 mg promontorium bone were kept in separate tubes with E.coli, Bacillus subtilis and Aspergillus niger. These tubes which were also containing a brain\heart broth medium were incubated for two weeks. Calcium and phosphate amounts in the medium were then re-measured after 2 weeks.
   Results; We found that calcium and phosphate departed in all groups, particularly in the E. coli group and that the plaque broke down. No change was seen in ossicles.
   Conclusion; Naturally existing bacteria and fungi, particularly E. coli, can decompose tympanosclerotic plaques. We observed that no change occurred when we applied the same study on human middle ear ossicles. We believe that the effect of otitis media-causing, acid phosphatase-active bacteria on Ca-P metabolism might shine a light on tympanosclerosis etiology.

AB  - Superior semicircular canal dehiscence: prevalence in a population with clinical suspected otosclerosis-type hearing loss. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) can present with a variety of symptoms that can be predominantly auditory, predominantly vestibular or both. It can mimic a wide range of otological disorders, in particular otosclerosis-like stapes fixation. Our study revealed that, in 5.3% of our patients with clinically Suspected otosclerosis. SSCD was detected in high-resolution multi-detector computed tomography (HRMDCT) of the temporal bone. We therefore emphasise the value of HRMDCT with reconstructions in the plane of the superior semicircular canal and perpendicular to the superior semicircular canal in the diagnostic work-up of each patient with a tentative diagnosis of otosclerosis-type stapes fixation. Where there are doubts, VEMP testing should be performed. We believe that a number of unexplained complications after an uneventful stapedotomy procedure might be explained by a pre-operatively undetected dehiscent superior semicircular canal and therefore unwarranted surgery.
   The typical feature of the conductive hearing loss due to SSCD compared to otosclerosis is an air-bone gap which is much more prominent at low frequencies than at high frequencies.

AB  - Objective: To use a study on dysgeusia to assess the usefulness of an otology database.
   Study Design: Data were extracted from the international Common Otology Database.
   Intervention: Primary stapes operations.
   Main Outcome Measure and Results: From a cohort of 14 otologists, only 8 (57%) were able to satisfy external validation and maintain data input for a period of at least 6 months. The rates of dysgeusia varied from 0 to 39% at 3 months and 0 to 27% at 6 months. The percentages of patients with taste disturbance at 6 months in the "nerve-cut" and "nerve-preserved" groups were 22.7 and 10.9%, respectively, although this was not statistically significant (chi(2); p = 0.325).
   Conclusion: Many surgeons found it difficult to maintain a prospective otology database. The rates of certain subjective symptoms such as dysgeusia are influenced by how vigorously the reviewers prompt the response from the patients. Dysgeusia after stapes surgery is common even if the chorda tympani nerve is preserved. Many patients whose chorda tympani nerve is divided may not complain of dysgeusia.

AB  - Acute suppurative otitis media is one of the most common infections in childhood, caused by Streptococcus pneumonia, Haemophilus influencae, Staphylococcus or Pneumococcus infection via the Eustachian tube. Occasionally it can be blood-borne during viral or bacterial infections. With the improvement of tubal function as the child grows, the incidence of acute AOM decreases. Acute suppurative otitis media is a severe inflammation of the middle ear mucosa accompanied by severe pain, fever, reddening and bulging of the tympanic membrane which may perforate spontaneously. The course can be variable, but usually resolves without consequences. Diagnosis is made on the basis of otoscopic findings. It is important to promptly recognize possible complications such as mastoiditis, sinus thrombosis and brain abscess, which are rare but threatening situations. Treatment of acute suppurative otitis media consists of the application of topical decongestants, analgesics, antipyretics and antibiotics. In some cases paracentesis and adenoidectomy might be helpful. In the case of complications a surgical procedure is mandatory. As a residuum of acute otitis media a permanent perforation of the eardrum may result in chronic otitis media. Rarely, squamous epithelium may grow through the perforation into the middle ear and thus give rise to a cholesteatoma.

AB  - Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a congenital malformation of craniofacial development; in these patients conventional direct laryngoscopy is very difficult and often unsuccessful because of the upper airway malformation. A 20-year-old man with TCS was scheduled for elective tympanoplasty. The patient showed the characteristic facial appearance of TCS, and a difficult airway was anticipated. After careful anesthesia induction, direct laryngoscopy with Macintosh blade no. 4 of a direct laryngoscope failed to visualize the epiglottis, even with cricoid pressure, resulting in a grade 4 Cormack and Lehane view. Next, the AirWay Scope was easily inserted, and his glottic opening was clearly visualized. An 8.0-mm-internal-diameter tracheal tube was then advanced into the trachea without any difficulty. The AirWay Scope is a very useful airway device for orotracheal intubation; it provides an excellent view of the glottis without requiring alignment of the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes, and appears to be promising for use in patients with a difficult airway.

AB  - Patients with diffuse obliterative otosclerosis have more extensive footplate pathology than annular cases. As a result of this more skill is required for diffuse otosclerosis cases, and postoperative hearing results are usually worse than annular cases. In this retrospective study we compared the preoperative audiological features of annular and diffuse otosclerosis patients. The subjects were 60 patients with conductive hearing loss who had undergone stapedectomy. Annular and diffuse groups were comprised of 30 patients each. Annular otosclerosis was defined as the footplate pathology involving the annular ligament only, where the footplate of the stapes is very thin and retains its bluish color. On the other hand diffuse, 0 bliterative otosclerosis was defined as the pathology involving the whole footplate and also in some cases extending beyond the confines of the annular ligament. In each group preoperative air- and bone-conduction levels at 125-6000 Hz and 500-4000 Hz were noted respectively. Average air-bone gap for the obliterative otosclerosis group was 37.5 dB; the same value for the annular group was 23.8 dB (p <0.05). The gap characteristics of the audiogram were different for the two groups. The annular group had an air-bone gap which was nearly constant for all the frequencies. In the diffuse otosclerosis group, the air-bone gap was more prominent in the low frequencies and it decreased at higher frequencies. No difference was noted in bone-conduction thresholds, and Carhart notch between the two groups. This study demonstrated that a large air-bone gap in patients with conductive hearing loss may be a sign of diffuse obliterative otosclerosis. This may warn the surgeon that a more challenging surgery is possible, and the patient may have a less favorable hearing result. Therefore, in the presence of a large air-bone gap, it may be appropriate to inform the patient of the strong possibility of diffuse otosclerosis.

AB  - Background: Inferior turbinate hypertrophy is one of the most common causes of nasal airway obstruction in children. Medical treatment often produces very little improvement. Radiofrequency therapy has recently been shown to be safe and effective in volumetric tissue reduction of the turbinates in adults, but no report has been published about its use in children. We prospectively evaluated the safety and effectiveness of radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction (RVTR) for the treatment of nasal obstruction caused by inferior turbinate hypertrophy in children.
   Methods: We followed up 93 children less than 9 years of age who underwent RVTR over 12 months. This surgery was performed with other procedures, such as tonsillectomy with or without grommet insertion (57 patients), tympanoplasty (110 patients), or grommet insertion alone (26 patients). Clinical examination, a medical questionnaire, and scores recorded pre- and postoperatively using Gertner-Podoshin plates were used to assess treatment outcomes 1 month, 6 months and 1 year after surgery.
   Results: No adverse effects were encountered. One primary bleed due to tonsillectomy was the only complication in this group. Eighty-seven children (94%) had significantly improved nasal, breathing postoperatively.
   Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that RVTR is a safe, effective method for the treatment of turbinate hypertrophy in children. In addition, our data demonstrates good patient acceptance over a period of 1 year. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives/Hypothesis: This study was undertaken to assess a transcanal osteotome technique for removing symptomatic ear canal exostoses. Outcome measures included healing rates and the rate of complications. Study Design: Prospective study in a private practice. Methods: A straight 1-mm osteotome and a curved 1-mm osteotome were used by way of a transcanal approach to incrementally remove obstructive ear canal exostoses. If anterior or superior bone growths were closely approximating the tympanic membrane, they were partially removed with a 1.5 mm cylindrical end- and side-cutting burr. Healing rates were monitored with weekly postoperative visits. Results: Two hundred twenty-one ear canals (140 patients) were consecutively treated with this technique. Healing was achieved at 2 to 8 (average 3.50) weeks, with 90% healed by 4 weeks. There were 4 mobilizations of a full-thickness segment of anterior bony canal wall; 3 exposures of periosteum anterior to the anterior bony wall; 1 tear of the tympanic membrane requiring a tympanoplasty; 18 anterior and 11 posterior tympanic membrane tears that healed spontaneously; 3 instances of sensorineural hearing decrease; 3 cases of new-onset postoperative tinnitus; and 1 instance of postoperative positioning vertigo. There were no lacerations of the tympanic membrane by an osteotome, no facial nerve injuries, no soft tissue stenoses of an ear canal, and no skin grafting of an ear canal. Conclusions. The described technique of using osteotomes transcanal for removal of symptomatic obstructive ear canal exostoses promoted rapid healing and was effective and safe.

AB  - Objective: To examine the preferred patient approach to chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) of the safe type.
   Methods: We designed a prospective study to note the variables in the patient's initial choice for approach to CSOM of the safe type at Buraidah Central Hospital, Al-Qassim, Saudi Arabia from January 2003 to December 2004.
   Results:During the 24-month study period, we included 63 consecutive patients diagnosed with CSOM of the safe type. We excluded patients with perforations associated with cholesteatomata, polyps, and acute infections. We administered a questionnaire discussing the options for the operation, and found most males preferred the endaural approach, and most females preferred the postaural approach.
   Conclusions: There was a significant preference by younger age groups for the postaural approach, especially younger females. They were more concerned about the site, visibility, and cosmetic result from the scar, and could camouflage the scar behind the pinna by hair or a traditional headscarf.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the location of the scala media in relation to the round window niche in human temporal bones.
   Design: Ten human temporal bones were investigated by radical mastoidectomy and promontory drill-out.
   Setting: Temporal bone laboratory.
   Outcome measures: The distance from the scala media to the anterior edge of the round window niche, measured by Fisch's stapedectomy measuring cylinders.
   Results: The scala media was identified at the transection point of a vertical line 1.6 to 2.2 mm (mean = 1.8 mm; standard deviation = 0.2) anterior to the anterior edge of the round window niche and a horizontal line 0.2 min inferior to the lower border of the oval window.
   Conclusion: This report demonstrates the point of entry into the scala media via the promontory in fixed temporal bone models, which may provide a site of entry for stem cells and gene therapy insertion.

AB  - Hypothesis: The aims of the present study were to determine the effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and pentoxifylline on subacute tympanic membrane (TM) perforations and to quantify the healing rate of such perforations treated with these drugs alone or in combination.
   Background: It is known that EGF modulates in vitro and in vivo proliferation of epithelial and endothelial cells. Pentoxifylline is a methylxanthine that has been used to treat experimental skin flaps and venous leg ulcers. Data in the literature regarding this subject are contradictory, and quantitative data regarding the effects of EGF and pentoxifylline on TM perforation healing are scarce.
   Methods: We studied 50 chinchillas submitted to TM perforation. On postoperative Day 30, eight were selected for histologic analysis. Of the remaining 42, those presenting little or no healing were distributed into four groups: control, EGF, pentoxifylline, and EGF combined with pentoxifylline.
   Results: Histologic analysis showed that the observation period adopted was sufficient to consider the TM perforations subacute. We found significant differences between the study groups and the control group in the healing rate of subacute TM perforations during a 30-day period (analysis of variance; p < 0.001), which was 30.3% for the EGF group, 3.6% for the pentoxifylline group, 16.5% for the EGF-pentoxifylline group, and 8.7% for the control group.
   Conclusion: The use of EGF promoted healing of subacute TM perforations in chinchillas, and the use of pentoxifylline did not. The combination of the two had no synergistic effect on the healing of these perforations.

LA  - English
KW  - Middle Ear Micro surgery
AB  - Around 2000 ENT Surgeons perform about 120000 middle ear microsurgery operations annually in India while the burden of otitis media is 50 million cases. A comprehensive questionnaire consisting of personal details of surgeons, his infrastructure, results, and complications was sent to 2000 ENT Surgeons from the latest AOI Directory. 400 Surgeons responded back from all over the country and the data collected was fed into a computer program and was analysed. Most of the responses were from western and southern parts of India. Almost all those who responded were performing myringoplasty while only 47 percent performed ossiculoplasty and 40 percent stapes surgery. Senior surgeons (more than 5 years after post graduation) had better infrastructure and better results as compared to junior surgeons, (less than 5 years). About 60 percent surgeons had Indian operating microscopes (commonest 80 percent being BEL) while 40 percent could afford foreign made microscopes (90 percent being Karl Zeiss). The procedure of myringoplasty is almost standardized while there is need to popularize ossiculoplasty and stupes surgery. Need was felt for technology transfer programmes from Southern and Western parts of India to Northern and Eastern parts of India.

   Setting: University hospital, tertiary referral center. Patient, Intervention, and
   Results: The authors describe an unusual case of cochlear fistula localized to the promontory discovered during tympanoplasty for noncholesteatomatous chronic otitis media in a 59-year-old woman. Bone conduction was slightly impaired after operation and hearing improved after a revision myringoplasty performed for reperforation.
   Conclusion: Erosion of the bone of the labyrinth can also be observed in noncholesteatomatous otitis media. The presence of a fistula is not always associated with profound hearing loss. Overlying pathologic tissue can be removed without damaging the membranous labyrinth.

AB  - The objective of this study is to determine the nature, duration and severity of chorda tympani symptoms in post-stapedotomy patients when the nerve has been known to have either sustained surgical manipulation or division. The study design was retrospective and blind, based at a tertiary Otology Referral Center ( Gloucestershire Royal Hospital). All successive patients undergoing stapedotomy operated upon by the senior author (JMR) between November 1991 and October 1998 were included. The main outcome measures were postoperative graded dysgeusia ( questionnaire) and post operative electrogustometry score, comparing the chorda tympani cut group and the chorda tympani preserved group. Sixty stapedotomies were performed in the study period. After a minimum interval of 8 months, questionnaire data were obtained in 55/60 (92%), and electrogustometry studies were carried out in 48/60 (80%). Symptoms of dysgeusia were experienced in the chorda tympani nerve cut ( CC) group in 95% and in the chorda preserved (CP) group in 52%. For those with symptoms, duration was 6.7 months ( +/- 4.9 SD) and 3.4 months ( +/- 3.7 SD) for the CC and CP groups, respectively. From the electrogustometry data, after 8 months, the risk of total loss of response is significantly higher in CC patients (94%) than in CP patients (25%) (P= 0.0001). Also at 8 months, 54% of CP patients had normal ipsilateral electrogustometry responses compared with 6% in the CC group. In conclusion, cutting the chorda tympani results in significantly greater symptoms than when subjected to manipulation only, and these symptoms are likely to be more long lasting. Therefore, it is our recommendation that where possible the chorda be preserved. The risk of severe chorda symptoms when the chorda is cut is small (< 5%). Preoperative consent to include dysgeusia is advised.

AB  - We describe the case history of a 70-year-old female patient presenting with bilateral hearing disturbance, facial paralysis, and vertigo. Radiological tests of temporal bone revealed soft tissue in the mastoid and tympanic cavities, and T1 weighted MRI revealed prominent Gd enhancement of the middle skull basal meninges. Middle ear inflammation appeared to induce pachymeningitis and to exacerbate associated symptoms, leading to a decline in the patient's overall condition. Bilateral mastoidectomies were effective in improving her general condition. Her hearing improved only on the right side because ossiculoplasty was performed only on that side. Her facial movement progressively improved and pachymeningitis diminished over time. We speculate that removal of the infectious granulation within the middle ears and mastoids ameliorated the acute inflammation. The etiology remains unknown in this case.

AB  - Background: Surgical trauma leads to systemic changes in haemostasis. Haematological changes activated by surgery may become so prominent that changes caused by anaesthesia might be hidden or underestimated. Therefore, we have undertaken a prospective study to compare the behaviour of selected factors involved in the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems.
   Methods: Forty healthy adult patients scheduled for otological surgery were enrolled in the study. Upon receiving informed consent, they were randomly assigned to receive either inhalational (IA) or total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). Platelet function (PFA100(TM)), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) panel, and generalized d-dimer (GFC) were studied during certain periods of anaesthesia to identify the changes in haemostasis.
   Results: Statistically, no significant change in DIC parameters were encountered between the two groups. No statistical difference was found between the two groups in the measured coagulation parameters, but statistically GFC showed slight activation in the 1st hour of surgical intervention.
   Conclusions: Presuming a minimal traumatic effect of surgical procedure on the determined variables, we conclude that different anaesthetic techniques have a negligible effect on platelet activation and fibrinolysis. The clinical relevance of coagulation activation and fibrinolysis during different anaesthetic techniques remains to be investigated.

AB  - Background: Among other materials it is also possible to use autologous fat tissue for closing tympanic membrane perforations. In this study we have evaluated 44 consecutive myringoplasties with adipose tissue performed between 1999 and 2001.
   Material and Method: The indications were residual microperforations following tympanoplasty with temporalis fascia or tympanic membrane perforations due to trauma or chronic otitis media simplex. Myringoplasty with fat tissue was performed as an outpatient procedure and took about 15 minutes. The adipose tissue was harvested from the posterior side of the ear lobe in local anaesthesia. After refreshing the borders of the tympanic membrane perforation with a micro hook, the adipose tissue was positioned into the perforation by using a handheld or fixed ear speculum. The graft was covered with a silk strip soaked with Garamycine ointment. In bigger perforations a bed of gelfoam was put into the tympanic cavity in order to avoid adhesions between the graft and the promontorium. Results: A permanent healing of the tympanic membrane was achieved in 40 (91%) out of the 44 patients. In 21 patients hearing improved between 5-10 dB. Surgical complications did not occur. Conclusions: Our results indicate that transcanal myringoplasty with adipose tissue is a simple and minimally invasive method for closing small to medium sized tympanic membrane perforations.

AB  - The intraoperative effect of the Argon and KTP laser was studied on 20 patients who had primary stapes surgery under local anaesthetic; 10 had Argon and 10 had KTP laser stapedotomy. Symptoms of inner ear disturbance such as dizziness and tinnitus were systematically recorded during the laser procedure. Both dizziness and tinnitus were relatively uncommon when the laser was used on the promontory. When the laser was used to transect the posterior crus, all the patients reported transient dizziness, probably from the thermal effect through the posterior crus into the inner ear. However, tinnitus was unusual during this stage. When the laser was used to fenestrate the footplate, only 30% of patients reported a transient dizziness as less laser energy was used. On the other hand, 55% of the patients experienced tinnitus during this stage, which indicates an acoustic effect on the inner ear. There is no difference between the Argon and KTP laser.

AB  - Objective: Evaluate in stapedectomy the clinical outcome and audiometric results (particularly bone conduction) of drilling the promontory because of a narrow oval window niche.
   Study Design: Retrospective.
   Setting: Tertiary referral center, private otology practice.
   Patients: Twenty-five stapedectomy patients requiring promontory drilling who had surgery between 1995 and 2000,
   Method: A total of 25 patients were evaluated with a minimum 6-month follow-up. Only patients who required promontory drilling and who had complete preoperative and postoperative audiometric testing including bone conduction were included. Promontory drilling was performed with a skeeter drill to thin the promontory. Twenty-five stapedectomy patients who did not undergo promontory drilling were randomly selected from this same period as a comparison group.
   Results: In addition to the narrow oval window niche, associated anatomical findings were facial nerve overhang in five patients and an obliterated footplate in three patients. Ninety-six percent of cases were successful (<10 dB postoperative air-bone gap). The one unsuccessful case was a strut over the mobile footplate that was later successfully revised. No patients suffered from intraoperative or postoperative tinnitus or vertigo. The mean 4-frequency (500-4,000 Hz) pure-tone average revealed slight improvement in bone conduction postoperatively.
   Conclusion: Drilling of the promontory in stapedectomy is required in only a small percentage of cases. Although audiometric results indicated the possibility of a slight amount of acoustic trauma from the drilling, the effect on hearing was minimal and not considered a contraindication to this procedure.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the anatomical landmarks of the retrotympanum using two different techniques, virtual endoscopy (VE) and fiberoptic endoscopy, and to correlate the results furnished by the two methods. Ten otosclerotic patients who were due to undergo stapedectomy were scanned using high-resolution spiral CT. Selected CT datasets were processed with Navigator 2.0 software to obtain virtual endoscopic views of the retrotympanum. Subsequently, during the surgical procedure, fiberoptic endoscopy was performed with 2.7-mm 0degrees and 30degrees rigid endoscopes. The ability of the two imaging methods to identify specific anatomical structures was then compared. In all cases the pyramidal eminence, pyramidal crest and sinus tympani were clearly identified in bot h VE images and otoendoscopy recordings, while fiberoptic endoscopy seemed to be less satisfactory than VE for studying the facial sinus, sinus of Proctor and fossula of Grivot. The two techniques proved to be equally sensitive for visualizing the ponticulus and subiculum, while the stapedius tendon could be visualized only by means of fiberoptic endoscopy. Overall, VE imaging appears promising for rendering important anatomical details of the retrotympanum, allowing identification of osseous landmarks and exploring recesses that are difficult to visualize via otoendoscopy.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the incidence of middle ear abnormalities in patients with bilateral otosclerosis, which could potentially affect successful stapedectomy, and the rates of success in these patients, including the chance of overclosure in the second car.
   Study Design: Retrospective case review of operative and audiologic records.
   Setting: Private otology practice.
   Patients: One thousand eight hundred patients underwent 3,600 primary stapedectomies for bilateral otosclerosis.
   Intervention: Analysis of perioperative and follow-up audiograms with associated operative findings, including obliterative otosclerosis and solid footplates, dehiscent or overhanging facial nerve, narrow oval window niche, promontory overhang, and ossicular fixation or malformation.
   Main Outcome Measures: Audiologic stapedectomy success was determined as overclosure or closure of preoperative airbone gap to less than 10 dB at I year or more of follow-up.
   Results: The rate of finding any abnormality was 25%. Abnormalities present bilaterally were found in 135 patients (7%), with otosclerosis requiring an oval window drillout as the most common finding (41%), followed by dehiscent or overhanging facial nerves (25%). Success in patients with abnormalities was 78% overall, with bilateral overclosure in 40%.
   Conclusions: Abnormal middle ear findings during stapedectomy occur in a significant percentage of patients. Reasonable rates of success and overclosure can still be expected, but this is somewhat finding-specific. The predictive value of these findings, the associated rates of success with potential impact on surgical counseling, and planning for the "other ear" are discussed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of fiberoptic carbon dioxide (CO2) laser welding for graft closure of tympanic membrane perforations in an animal model.
   STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Tympanic membrane perforation was surgically induced in 11 eardrums of 7 given pigs. A lumbar facial graft was placed over the wound, and albumin drops served as a biologic solder. CO2 laser energy, transmitted through silver halide infrared transmitting fibers, was used for "spot-welding" along the circumference of the graft. The welded sites were evaluated by using a surgical microscope as well as by evaluating the sites histologically.
   RESULTS: Healing started 3 to 4 days after surgery and was completed within 3 weeks with the formation of a neotympanum. Some inflammation with granulation tissue was noted in 5 eardrums.
   CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: These preliminary results indicate that CO2 laser tympanoplasty with a fiberoptic delivery system may be a promising new technique for the clinical setting.

AB  - Different policies on the treatment of tympanic membrane perforation in the pediatric age group continue to exist. Thirty patients were included in this study over a period of 2 years, where cartilage perichondrium composite graft (CPCG) was used to close the tympanic membrane perforation. Successful drum closure was achieved in 86.6% of cases, regardless of the site of perforation or the status of the operated ear. The graft was taken from the tragus and was placed in an underlay fashion with cartilage towards the promontory and the perichondrium immediately to the tympanic membrane remnants. The postoperative hearing gain although delayed up to 6 months was: excellent either subjective or objective. So, CPCG has proved advantageous as a graft material to close perforation in the tympanic membrane in pediatric age group. (C) 2001 Published by Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe a simple approach to the rat middle ear because there are few clear descriptions of this technique with minimal morbidity and mortality. STUDY
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Six male tong-Evans rats were used in this study. We designed a cervical approach to the middle ear with the purpose of creating an experimental model of ossiculoplasty that permits the postoperative survival of the animal.
   RESULTS: It was possible in all cases to visualize the majority of structures of the tympanic cavity: promontory, round window, stapedial artery, stapes, incus, and tympanic membrane. There were no cases of postoperative infection or facial paralysis.
   CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The ventral approach to the rat middle ear is a rapid and simple technique that makes the rat the animal of choice for many otologic investigations.

AB  - Objective: To assess a new device intended to cover tympanic membrane (TM) perforations in an office setting.
   Study Design: Not all patients with TM perforations require or choose tympanoplasty surgery, Alternatives to surgery (e.g., paper and plastic onlay) have limitations that prompted a need For an alternative method. A new, simple device, designed to be inserted into the perforation, is made out of a very soft silicone in the shape of a scaled tympanostomy tube. The TM Patcher is self-stabilizing without adhesives.
   Setting: An outpatient office. Patients: Twenty-nine patients with 30 consecutive dry TM perforations, who volunteered to participate in the study. Patients with known cholesteatomas or persistent drainage were excluded.
   Interventions: In the office, patients had the Patcher inserted into their dry TM pel fc,ration. No anesthetics were needed.
   Main Outcome Measures: Hearing was tested before and after patching by conventional audiometry. The ears were assessed for Patcher position, perforation status, and infection.
   Results: Patients with normal ossicular chains had immediate improvement of hearing. No patient experienced hearing loss. Twenty-six of 30 patients (87%) were free of infection. Two patients (7%) with persistent drainage were taken to surgery and were found to have mastoid disease (cholesteatoma or granulation tissue). Three patients (10%) had rare otorrhea after patching and were treated by drops or temporary removal of the Patcher. Two of these three ears subsequently became dry and then healed. Small perforations often healed or became smaller (46% of 3-mm perforations) despite failure of tympanoplasty or conventional office patching with a flat piece of paper or plastic. Perforations >5 mm did not heal, however, these patients simply continued wearing their Patcher and benefited by protection of their middle ear, typically with improved hearing and resolution of tinnitus, Occasional spontaneous lateralization was allowed to occur in the small perforations, which often later healed. In larger perforations, the Patcher was simply repositioned.
   Conclusions: The Patcher is a safe and effective alternative for office patching of dry perforations when surgery is contraindicated or is refused by the patient. New materials should increase healing rates when applied to a Phase II Patcher.

AB  - This study examines the surgical and audiologic results of myringoplasty and what factors affect these outcomes. It also examines whether patients experience any improvement in their main symptoms following surgery. This was a retrospective analysis of case notes, patient questionnaires, and audiograms of all patients undergoing myringoplasty between 1990 and 1995 at Walsgrave Hospital, Coventry, UK. Overall success of myringoplasty for consultants was 81% and for trainees was 79%, with an overall success rate of 86% in children. Posterior and inferior perforations had a 90% success rate for repair, compared to only 67% of anterior perforations. There was a statistically significant reduction in air-bone gaps following myringoplasty, and the majority of patients felt that their ears were drier and had improved hearing. Myringoplasty is a successful procedure in the hands of consultants and trainees alike. The results are satisfactory enough to justify surgery purely for deafness and also in symptomatic children. There is a strong correlation between surgical success and resolution of symptoms and generally a satisfactory improvement in hearing.

AB  - Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by osseous fragility, blue sclerae and hearing loss. In order to assess the impact of stapedotomy on improving hearing on OI, a retrospective, one-group, pre-test-post-test design was used to compare the pre-operative and postoperative audiograms of nine OI patients, treated with stapedotomy for their mixed hearing loss. Operative findings included fixation or thickening of the stapes footplate with normal superstructure configuration and hypervascularization of the promontory mucosa. Immediate post-operative results showed a significant improvement (p<0.05) from 250-4000 Hz in air conduction and from 250-2000 Hz in bone conduction. A significant closure of the air-bone gap between 250-2000 Hz was also achieved (p<0.05). The long-term results remained satisfactory with a mean threshold shift of 8 dB HL and an almost unchanged air-bone gap. These satisfactory results and the lack of complications make stapedotomy an appealing method for the management of OI-associated hearing loss.

AB  - In 548 stapes operations performed in Berne during the period 1994-1998, an anomaly of the course of the facial nerve was observed in 37 cases. 29 exhibited partial prolapse of the nerve over the oval window, with or without dehiscence of the bony canal, while 5 showed total prolapse of the nerve over the oval window. In one case the nerve was duplicated round the oval window and in a further instance the facial nerve was situated over the promontory and also over the oval window. In one other case the nerve was spread widely over the oval window. Concomitant anomalies of the stapes were frequently observed. The following surgical techniques were employed: in the case of partial prolapse of the nerve, a small piston was placed in the lower part of or in the oval win-dow, which was widened towards the promontory. In cases of total prolapse of the facial nerve the prosthesis was drilled straight into the promontory. Where the nerve was duplicated the prosthesis was placed in the footplate between the nerve branches, and where the nerve ran over the promontory and over the oval window the prosthesis was placed above the oval window. In the case where the nerve was spread widely over the oval window, no prosthesis was inserted. 78% of patients had a residual air-bone gap of 20 dB or less; in only three cases did hearing fail to improve. One patient with Crouzon disease involving a complex anomaly had a hearing impairment of 22 dB. There was no deafness, facial paralysis or vertigo with nystagmus.

AB  - Large tympanic membrane perforations usually require a surgical tympanoplasty for closure. Reducing surgical costs and risks has encouraged investigators to examine nonsurgical office procedures for healing these perforations. Growth accelerators are the most promising agents. We study here the closure of large acute perforations using weekly applications of 1 mg of 1% hyaluronic acid (HA), 0.4 mu g basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or 1.0 mu g epidermal growth factor (EGF) directly to the tympanic membranes of the experimental ears. Control ears were treated with 0.1 mt Vasocidin. Complete closure was obtained in 100% of the ears treated with HA and EGF and 85.7% of those treated with bFGF by day 21, compared with 63.6% of the controls by day 32. Moderate-to-severe ipsilateral and contralateral external canal hypertrophy was noted in 14.2% and 37.5% of the ears treated with bFGF and HA, respectively, but was not seen in ears treated with EGF or in the control group.

AB  - Among different types of lasers, the erbium laser exhibits particularly favourable characteristics for ear surgery. Experiments with application of erbium laser pulses to the isolated stapes connected to an inner ear model confirmed that there was virtually no thermal effect to the inner ear liquid and that the border damage zone on the stapes footplate perforation did not exceed 5-10 mu m. Erbium laser pulses, however, produce pressure waves due to the explosive ablation of tissue. Pulses of 10 to 17 J/cm(2) producing pressure waves between 140 and 160 dB appear to be a limit for clinical application. With these criteria, an in-house built erbium YAG laser with a fiberoptic delivery device was used in lj patients for stapedotomy. A special microhandpiece, where a zirconium fluoride fiber was connected to a quartz tip, was developed. In addition, three patients had stapedotomy with a commercially available Zeiss (Opmi(R) TwinER) microscope equipped with a micromanipulator-operated erbium laser beam. One year after surgery, the air-bone gap was closed in all patients to within 20 dB between 0.5 and 3 kHz with only minor permanent bone conduction threshold losses (< 20 dB). However: we observed an immediate postoperative middle and high frequency loss of up to 75 dB on bone conduction threshold measurements 2 h after surgery, suggesting an acoustic traumatization by the erbium laser. This threshold shift recovered close to preoperative values within 6 h. These observations prompted us to discontinue the clinical use of erbium laser for stapedotomy until the problem of temporary acoustic traumatization is resolved.

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to challenge the classical hypothesis that a negative preoperative 512-Hz Rinne tuning fork test (bone conduction greater than air conduction) is a necessary condition to allow consistent objective and subjective hearing improvement with surgery for otosclerosis.
   Study Design: The study design was retrospective (chart review and questionnaire).
   Setting: The study was conducted at a Florida Ear and Sinus Center at Sarasota, Florida, a tertiary otology-neurotology referral center.
   Patients: Patients who underwent primary laser stapedotomy with equivocal (air = bone) preoperative 512-Hz Rinne test results participated.
   Intervention: KTP laser stapedotomy was performed.
   Main Outcome Measures: Audiologic measurements of air-bone gap closure and patient assessment of hearing improvement and satisfaction were conducted.
   Results: The air-bone gap was closed to within 10 dB in all cases. There were no complications. Eighteen patients were questioned about their results. Hearing improvement was subjectively described as "excellent" or "good" by 17 (94%), and 16(89%) thought the surgery was "absolutely" worthwhile.
   Conclusions: The preoperative 512-Hz Rinne test results need not be negative to achieve significant air-bone Sap closure and subjective appreciation of improved hearing.

AB  - The efficacy of hyaluronic acid (HA) foam in the prevention of middle ear adhesions and other structural abnormalities in guinea pigs undergoing experimental tympanoplasty was investigated. Postoperative changes in the middle ear were evaluated by light microscopy after 6 weeks. The presence of adhesions, diminution of airspace, new bone formation, tympanic membrane (TM) formation, and mucosal inflammation was characterized by an objective grading system. Results were compared to absorbable gelatin sponge (AGS) and a control group (no middle ear packing). The control group showed the best average scores for all parameters tested except for adhesion formation. However, these results were statistically significant only when compared with those of the AGS group for airspace preservation, new bone formation, and TM formation. Although the HA foam group showed better average results than did the AGS group for all parameters tested, none were statistically significant. Although HA foam appears to be a promising middle ear packing agent, further experimental trials are warranted before any firm conclusions may be made.

AB  - Electrocochleography (ECoG) is an objective, electrophysiologic test useful in the clinical diagnosis of endolymphatic hydrops, or Meniere's disease, The purpose of this study was to determine if the position of the needle, using transtympanic methodology, gives a variable SP/AP (summating potential/action potential) response. SP/AP ratios were obtained during routine tympanoplasty procedures, After the tympanic membrane remnant was removed using a lateral graft technique, precise needle placement was obtained at the medial and lateral round window niches, as well. as on the promontory. SP/AP ratios were obtained in these three needle positions. There was no significant difference in the SP/AP ratio responses despite the location of needle placement. The use of transtympanic electrocochleography can give very good wave form morphology and consistent results. Therefore, if elevated SP/AP ratios do occur, they are thought to be due to a pathologic process of the ear and not needle placement.

AB  - Cartilage has shown promise as a graft material to close perforations in the tympanic membrane (TM), particularly in cases of advanced middle ear pathology. Although it is similar to fascia, its more rigid quality tends to resist resorption and retraction. However, it is this rigid quality that has led many to anticipate a significant conductive hearing loss when using cartilage to reconstruct the TM. Because little has been reported in the literature comparing hearing results using cartilage with results using other grafting materials, this retrospective study was conducted to compare the hearing results of patients with cartilage tympanoplasty with results in patients who underwent revision tympanoplasty using perichondrium. Both series of patients had undergone type I tympanoplasty, and the middle ear pathology was considered to be similar between the two groups. TM closure was achieved in all 22 patients undergoing cartilage reconstruction, but three of the 20 patients undergoing perichondrium reconstruction had a recurrent perforation during the follow-up period (approximately 1 year). The average pre-and postoperative pure-tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG) was 21.1 dB and 6.8 dB for the cartilage group and 17.9 dB and 7.7 dB for the perichondrium group, respectively. These gains in hearing were statistically significant (P < 0.001 in each case), but there was no statistically significant difference in hearing results between the two groups. Analysis of the PTA-ABG as a function of percentage of TM reconstructed showed no statistically significant difference in hearing results due to percentage of cartilage used. These results indicate that cartilage tympanoplasty offers the possibility of a rigorous TM reconstruction with excellent postoperative hearing results.

AB  - Erbium-YSGG laser systems are promising tools in ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgery. The high absorption in biological tissues, resulting in precise tissue ablation with minimal thermal tissue damage, and the possibility to guide the radiation through optical fibres make the 2.79 mu m wavelength a favourite for microsurgery.
   In order to simulate the fenestration of the human stapes foot plate required for prosthesis implantation when treating otosclerosis, five guinea pig cochleae were irradiated in vivo until perforation was achieved. The laser-induced temperature rise and pressure transients evoke activity in the inner hair cells that was investigated by micro-iontophoresis.
   Perforation of the cochlea bone (hole diameter of 350 mu m) can be performed with a few laser pulses and high precision with a thermal damage zone of <100 mu m. The bone ablation rate is 10 +/- 2 mu m pulse(-1) at a radiant exposure of 12 J cm(-2). The functionality of the afferent inner hair cells in the guinea pig cochlea was verified before and after laser treatment using glutamate receptor agonists AMPA and NMDA. For the above selected laser parameters, the induced 15-min enhanced activity was blockable with the specific reversible AMPA and NMDA antagonists CNQX and AP-7.
   Micro-iontophoresis confirms the reversibility of cochlea functionality after its perforation with Er-YSGG laser pulses. A limit of radiant exposure around 12 J cm(-2) is found for safe fenestration. It is demonstrated that the Er-YSGG laser is a precise and safe instrument whilst still using adequate laser parameters. On the other hand, this study demonstrates the potential of uncontrollable and unintended induced damage, resulting from vapour channel formation in the perilymph, if a high laser radiant exposure is applied.

AB  - Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), or the Van der Hoeve-de Kleyn syndrome, is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders. The key features in this disease are bone fragility with a tendency to spontaneous fractures and deformations. The classical triad of symptoms involves a conductive and/or sensorineural hearing impairment together with a tendency to spontaneous bone fractures and blue sclerae. Between January 1988 and December 1994, ear surgery was performed on eight ears of six OI patients who presented with mixed hearing loss preoperatively. Pathological changes observed in the middle ear were atrophy and/or fractures of the stapedial crura in combination with thickening and fixation of the stapes footplate. Partial stapedectomy was performed in seven cases and a neo-window was created in the promontory of one patient when an overhanging facial canal obscured visualization of the oval window niche. Pre- and postoperative bone conduction thresholds did not differ in any of the patients. Postoperatively, mean values of the air-bone gap in the main speech frequency range were below 10 dB. Functional results following stapes surgery in patients with otosclerosis during the same time interval (n = 857) did not differ significantly. These data indicate that stapes surgery in OI patients can be performed with the same functional predictability as in otosclerosis patients, even though the underlying etiology is considerably different.

AB  - In a type IV tympanoplasty, the stapes footplate is directly exposed to incoming sound while the round window is ''shielded,'' usually with a fascia graft. Postoperative hearing results are quite variable, with air-bone gaps ranging from 10 to 60 dB. A cadaveric human temporal bone preparation was developed to investigate the middle ear mechanics of this operation to identify causes of variable results and to test predictions of a recently described theoretic model of type IV tympanoplasty. The ear canal, tympanic membrane, malleus, and incus were removed so as to expose the stapes and round window to the sound stimulus. A ''cavum minor'' chamber (air space adjacent to the round window) was constructed around the round window niche. The round window could be isolated from sound by placing an acoustic shield over this chamber. The mechanical properties of the shield, cavum minor, annular ligament, and round window membrane were varied experimentally. Stapes velocity as determined by an optical motion sensor was used as a measure of hearing level. The largest stapes velocity occurred with a mobile stapes and round window, a stiff shield, and a well-aerated cavum minor. Partial fixation of the stapes or round window caused a decrease in stapes velocity. Acoustic shields of conchal cartilage or Silastic silicone rubber sheeting (approximately 1 mm thick) provided near-optimal shielding. A temporalis fascia shield resulted in a stapes velocity 10 to 20 dB less than that seen with a cartilage or Silastic silicone rubber shield at low frequencies. A cavum minor air space as small as 16 mu L was sufficient for unrestricted stapes motion, provided the air was in contact with the round window membrane. These results qualitatively matched predictions of our model, but there were some quantitative differences. The clinical implications of our results are that in order to optimize postoperative hearing, the surgeon should 1) preserve normal stapes mobility, preferably by covering the footplate with a very thin split-thickness skin graft, not a fascia graft; 2) reinforce a fascia shield with cartilage or Silastic silicone rubber; 3) create conditions that promote aeration of the round window niche; and 4) preserve the mobility of the round window membrane.

AB  - Purpose: This retrospective study investigates the general outcome and subjective impression of patients who have undergone surgery for otosclerosis. Postoperative complaints and complications, as well as hearing results, are also reported.
   Materials and Methods: Questionnaire and audiomeric results of 246 stapes surgery patients (270 operations) were studied.
   Results: Hearing results showed a mean improvement in pure-tone average of 26 dB and air-bone gap closure to within 10 dB in 214 cases (79%). No serious complications or profound sensorineural hearing loss occurred. Patients were generally pleased with surgery, and subjective evaluation of benefit corresponded with objective audiometric result. However, a variety of complaints, such as vertigo, tinnitus, loud noise intolerance, pain, chorda tympani symptoms, and sound distortion problems, were reported. Most of these symptoms correlated significantly with the patients' subjective opinion of the surgical outcome.
   Conclusion: Patients as well as surgeons consider hearing improvement as the main indicator of success in surgery for otosclerosis. However, postoperative symptoms and complaints can be expected in a certain percentage of patients. Because these can influence the general outcome of surgery, the ear surgeon should try to painstakinly refine his technique in an effort to minimize their sources. They should also be discussed in preoperative patient counseling. Copyright (C) 1997 by W.B. Saunders Company.

AB  - Silastic(R) sheeting is used to restore a mucosally lined middle ear space and to prevent mucosal adhesions between the medial surface of the tympanic membrane and the promontory after surgical procedures involving the removal of middle ear mucosa. To determine the long-term (1.2 to 21.2 years) effects of Silastic sheeting in the middle ear, six temporal bones from patients with permanent Silastic sheeting in the middle ear cavity after single-stage tympanoplasty were examined. In all six bones, no histologic evidence of foreign body reaction, rejection, or chronic inflammation in the middle ear surrounding the silicone sheeting was observed. Furthermore, the middle ear space was lined by normal-appearing, continuous middle ear mucosa. In four temporal bones, there was no evidence of significant submucosal fibrosis. In two bones, significant submucosal fibrosis was attributable to concurrent middle ear disease rather than to the presence of the silicone. It is concluded that Silastic sheeting in the middle ear after single-stage procedures may prevent adhesions between mucosal surfaces. Given eustachian tube function, Silastic promotes a mucosally lined, aerated middle ear cavity without apparent foreign body reaction, rejection, or chronic inflammatory response.

TI  - EVALUATION OF COCHLEAR FUNCTION IN A PATIENT WITH FAR-ADVANCED OTOSCLEROSIS
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OTOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - A patient with "far-advanced" otosclerosis with a profound bilateral hearing loss was evaluated for cochlear reserve using transtympanic electrocochleography (ECoG) and promontory stimulation. Results indicated that both ECoG and promontory responses were present, indicating that cochlear function was present bilaterally. A stapedectomy resulted in closure of the air-bone gap. Postoperative hearing yielded excellent aided responses compared to no measurable preoperative hearing aid benefit. This case serves to demonstrate the value of evaluating cochlear function using these electrophysiologic techniques.

T2  - ARCHIVES OF OTOLARYNGOLOGY-HEAD & NECK SURGERY
LA  - English
AB  - Small-fenestra stapedotomy was popularized in efforts to reduce the incidence of sensorineural hearing loss following stapes surgery for otospongiosis. Lasers were advocated as a tool to fenestrate the stapes footplate. Conversion of radiant energy from the laser into heat in the vestibule represents the greatest potential risk to the inner ear. Using a CO2 laser with a focal point of 150 .mu.m of 300 mm, fenestrations of the stapes footplate were performed in a series of 14 anesthetized cats.  The laser power output ranged from 0.47-3.05 W, with pulse durations of 0.2 and 0.5 s. Resultant temperature elevations in the vestibule, measured by a thin-wire thermocouple, ranged from 0 to 4.4.degree. C (0-8.degree. F) and directly correlated to wattage and duration of the laser-beam pulse. Temperature changes could be reduced by use of lower wattage, shorter pulse duration, timed intervals between pulses and convection cooling of the promontory.

T2  - ACTA OTO-LARYNGOLOGICA
LA  - English
AB  - Absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam), commonly used in otosurgery [in humans], was gently inserted or firmly packed into the middle ear cavities of rats. The postoperative changes were evaluated 2-3 mo. later when, apart from some air-filled canals leading from the tympanal orifice of the eustachian tube towards the attic, the middle ear cavity had become filled with newly formed bone and an amorphous mass of adhesions and bridles. The mass consisted of loose connective tissue, with fibroblasts, vessels and inflammatory cells. The tympanic membrane was retracted and fixed to the promontory. There were no signs that any Gelfoam had been removed through the eustachian tube. Similar tissue reactions may occur in tympanoplasties.

TI  - CLINICAL RECORDS - LATE ONSET SENSORINEURAL HEARING-LOSS FOLLOWING STAPEDECTOMY - (AN UNCOMMON CAUSE)
T2  - JOURNAL OF LARYNGOLOGY AND OTOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The occurrence of sensorineural hearing loss in otosclerosis is well recognized and is usually due to the progression of labyrinthine disease. A similar loss may accompany stapedectomy; this usually occurs at the time of operation, rather than being one of late onset. The latter is generally assumed to be caused by a fistula or by the progression of cochlear otosclerosis, rather than by an additional pathology. As this case illustrates, a 2nd pathology, particularly one which is retrocochlear, does occur. The seriousness of this type of loss cannot be understated; any asymmetric sensorineural hearing loss in otosclerosis (excepting an operative loss) should be promptly investigated to exlude a retrocochlear cause.

TI  - TYMPANOPLASTY OPERATIONS IN SEPTIC CASES - A NEW TECHNIQUE
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - Afrikaans
AB  - The very high incidence of postoperative sepsis in tympanoplasty operations on ears with infected cholesteatoma prompted the development of a new technique to improve the control of local infection. An irrigation tube is placed into the mastoid antrum at the time of operation, through which the ear is irrigated in the postoperative period with an antibiotic solution. In 25 tympanomastoidectomy operations, only 6 patients developed postoperative sepsis, 5 of which were due to faulty administration of the antibiotic. In 13 tympanoplasty operations, 6 patients had an unsuccessful outcome. Four of these were due to poor patient selection. Systemic antibiotics are given immediately preoperatively and continued in the postoperative period until the course has been completed.

AB  - In a series of patients undergoing stapedectomy with the Shea technique utilizing a No. 90 polyethylene strut and vein graft reconstruction, drilling of the oval-window area (extralabyrinthine drilling) was frequently utilized. Hearing tests 4 months postoperatively showed no differences in the amount of hearing improvement among patients in whom both the footplate and promontory were drilled, patients in whom only the promontory was drilled, and patients in whom no drilling was done. When patients from all 3 groups were tested 3 years postoperatively, there were again no differences in hearing among the groups.
