N2  - Susac syndrome can resemble various disorders resulting in a delayed or missed diagnosis and subsequent delays in treatment. Here, we present how successful consideration of patient history, symptoms, and ancillary testing led to prompt diagnosis and treatment of Susac syndrome by ophthalmologists. A 27-year-old active duty infantryman presented with sudden vision loss in the right eye during strenuous exercise after experiencing similar symptoms in the left eye 5 months earlier. The patient's medical history was notable for mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss, confounded by a history of concussions, syncope, frequent ear infections, tympanic membrane perforation requiring tympanoplasty, and loud noise exposures. Identification of branch retinal artery occlusions on fluorescein angiography and low-to-mid frequency hearing loss confirmed the diagnosis of Susac syndrome. The patient was immediately treated with high-dose oral prednisone and subsequently transitioned to rituximab infusions to preserve vision. Susac syndrome should be considered when a patient presents with vision loss, hearing deficits, and or cognitive changes, even if symptoms are separated by time and seemingly attributed to more common causes.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States 2025.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To investigate whether degree of asymmetric hearing impairment influences patient-reported outcome measures and objective hearing results in primary stapedotomy., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Register study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Data from the Swedish Quality Register for Otosclerosis Surgery consisting of 90% of stapes operations performed in Sweden., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: The 984 patients eligible for inclusion were categorized on the basis of preoperative hearing impairment: unilateral, bilateral asymmetric, or bilateral symmetric. Pure-tone audiometry and patient-reported outcome measures were analyzed, and Glasgow benefit plots were constructed. Ordinal logistics regression analyses were performed to adjust for factors influencing PROMs associated with degree of asymmetric hearing., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Over 90% of patients across all groups reported improved or much improved hearing ability post-surgery. Ninety-five percent of patients who rated their hearing as worse or much worse after surgery had an air-conductive gain of <20 dB PTA4. Individuals with unilateral hearing impairment were more likely to report lower satisfaction with hearing function and daily life activities after surgery compared with those with bilateral hearing impairment, especially bilateral symmetric hearing impairment. In terms of hearing function, the bilateral symmetric hearing impairment group showed a significant decrease in the log odds of reporting lower satisfaction with a coefficient of -0.71 (95% confidence interval, -1.13 to -0.33), whereas the bilateral asymmetric hearing impairment group showed a nonsignificant decrease with a coefficient of -0.14 (95% confidence interval, -0.41 to 0.14) compared with the unilateral hearing impairment group. Tinnitus was more frequent in those with unilateral hearing impairment., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Those with preoperative unilateral hearing impairment were more likely to express lower satisfaction with the results, compared with patients with bilateral impairment. Our findings suggest that the degree of bilateral hearing impairment should be considered in preoperative counseling, to better align with patient expectations regarding the benefit of surgery. An estimated air-conductive gain of at least 20 dB PTA4 was favorable for patient satisfaction.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2025, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The efficacy of the transcanal endoscopic approach in tympanoplasty, cholesteatoma removal, and stapedotomy is detailed. This study reviews evidence on the feasibility of endoscopic ossiculoplasty as a suitable alternative to traditional microscopic ossiculoplasty., <ovid:b>DATA SOURCES</ovid:b>: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to 19 June 2024 for articles comparing endoscopic and microscopic ossicular chain reconstruction., <ovid:b>REVIEW METHODS</ovid:b>: This systematic review was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The primary outcomes assessed include air bone gap closure, pre-operative and post-operative air bone gap, pure tone audiometry, and word recognition scores. The secondary outcomes include operation time, surgical success, and surgical complications. These outcomes between microscopic and endoscopic techniques were pooled and compared as mean differences using a random-effects model. The Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) and Cochrane Risk-of-Bias Tool for Randomized Trials (RoB2) scale were adopted to assess for study bias in observational studies and randomized controlled trials, respectively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: This study included five studies comprising 504 patients. While endoscopic ossiculoplasty had shorter operating durations (95% CI -42.97 to -1.57), it conferred comparable air bone gap closure (95% CI -0.34 to 3.76), post-operative pure tone audiogram (95% CI 10.97-18.77), and surgical success. Additional qualitative strengths identified in endoscopic ear surgery include improvements in visualization, decreased need for supplemental incisions, excellent ergonomics, and reduced post-operative pain., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Overall, endoscopic ossiculoplasty may confer comparable audiological outcomes to microscopic ossiculoplasty and may serve as a reasonable alternative surgical approach.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a novel modified asymmetric chondro-perichondrial island graft in tympanoplasty. The design features a longer anterior segment compared to the posterior segment, addressing limitations of symmetrical grafts. We investigated the impact of this modified graft on hearing improvement and graft success rates in patients undergoing tympanoplasty surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This retrospective study evaluated 784 patients with chronic otitis media who underwent primary type I tympanoplasty with a modified asymmetric chondro-perichondrial island graft technique. Demographics and characteristics of all patients, preoperative location of the perforation, and Pure-Tone Audiometry (PTA) were assessed preoperatively, and graft success and postoperative hearing outcomes were evaluated at the 12-month follow-up., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: This study evaluated the efficacy of a modified asymmetric chondro-perichondrial island graft in tympanoplasty. In 784 patients, the mean 12-month postoperative Air-Bone Gap (ABG) improvement was 17.3 dB with a 99% graft success rate. Preoperative ABG significantly improved from 24 dB to 6.6 dB postoperatively (p < 0.001). Perforation location did not affect ABG improvement (p = 0.193) but did influence graft success rate (p < 0.001). No sensorineural hearing loss, retraction pockets, or cholesteatoma were observed postoperatively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Tympanoplasty offers a well-established surgical approach for restoring hearing function and preventing recurrent otorrhea. The asymmetric cartilage-perichondrium island graft design has emerged as a promising technique to achieve optimal functional and anatomical outcomes in tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: Level 4.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To determine which ear environment risk factors impact ossiculoplasty hearing outcomes and to generate a statistically-valid grading system for ossiculoplasty outcome reporting., <ovid:b>STUDY TYPE</ovid:b>: Retrospective case series., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A multi-institutional database was generated from cases performed between 2011 and 2019. Preoperative and postoperative hearing thresholds were recorded alongside potential ear environment risk factors. Multiple variable linear regression statistical analyses of risk factors were applied to determine independent association with postoperative pure tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG). Significant factors were used to generate a statistically-weighted grading scale of Ear Environment Risk (EER)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 1679 cases had a mean follow-up time of 33.6 months (SD 36.3) and a mean postoperative PTA-ABG of 21.2 (SD 12.8). Multiple revision status (p < 0.001), presence of canal wall down mastoidectomy cavity (p = 0.020), absent malleus (p < 0.001), absent stapes superstructure (p = 0.016), frequent otorrhea (p = 0.008), pediatric age (p < 0.001), and blunted/lateralized tympanic membrane (p = 0.003) were independently correlated with PTA-ABG. These factors were incorporated into an EER Scoring System with four distinct risk groups wherein each risk group was significantly correlated with PTA-ABG, and this grading system was better correlated with PTA-ABG (Kendall's tau = 0.193) than other existing published grading scales., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Grading environment risk according to a novel EER scoring system generates meaningful risk groupings that correlate with ossiculoplasty postoperative PTA-ABG, and this holds potential to frame reporting of hearing outcomes for future ossiculoplasty research., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 3 Laryngoscope, 2024.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Primary stapes surgery is considered a challenging intervention in ear surgery. Despite an risk of deafness in 0.5-1 percent, this procedure has still a good benefit-risk ratio due to the improvement in hearing and quality of life that is usually achieved. However, revision after prior stapes surgery is considered even more challenging. Revisions after stapes surgery are very heterogeneous procedures, both in terms of the indication and the surgical strategy and are generally considered to be significantly more demanding. Reasons for complications after prior stapes surgery as well as strategies for successful revisions are not well described in the literature., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Retrospective cohort study, tertiary referral center. 124 cases of revisions after prior stapes surgery were identified between 2011-2022 and are analyzed based on biographic data, clinical, audiological, and intraoperative findings as well as the eventual therapy. Cases were analyzed regarding indication, intraoperative finding and the surgical strategy chosen., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Acute, subacute, and long-term complications of the primary intervention as well as other incidental reasons such as progressive hearing loss can be identified as indication for revision surgery. Preoperative clinical findings were correlated to intraoperative findings and surgical strategies. Audiological results are discussed., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Different recommendations for the indication of a surgical revision can be derived depending on the individual preoperative case history and findings. In addition, there are patterns regarding the chances of success of a revision, especially in cases of persistent conductive hearing loss chances of hearing improvement seem possible in more than 80% of cases.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To report the intraoperative observations and hearing outcomes in patients undergoing endoscopic revision ossiculoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective cohort of patients who had undergone revision ossiculoplasty were enrolled in this study. Intraoperative findings were documented. Follow-up visits were scheduled from 3 to 12 months post-surgery to assess hearing levels and record any potential complications., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Between April 2020 and May 2023, a total of 26 cases were enrolled, with 11 male patients represented. The mean age of the patients was 40.5 +/- 9.4 years, ranging from 18 to 66 years. During the revision surgeries, various intraoperative findings were noted, including adhesive tissues affecting the activity of ossicular chain (observed in 37.0% of cases), tympanosclerosis of the ossicular chain (also in 37.0% of cases), dislocation of ossicular prosthesis (33.3%), erosion of the ossicular chain (33.3%), and identified cholesteatoma (11.1%). In terms of hearing outcomes, a significant improvement was observed. Overall, only 37.0% of patients achieved an air-bone gap of 20 dB or less, indicating the inferior outcome in revision ossiculoplasty., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: This study highlight the role of inflammatory responses (adhesion, tympanosclerosis), stapes erosion, and prosthesis dislocation, as contributing factors to the failure of primary tympanoplasty. Endoscopic revision ossiculoplasty emerges as a reliable and effective approach.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: One-handedness is a challenge in conventional endoscopic ear surgery (EES). We present results on the first-ever application of the passive endoscope holder 'Endofix exo' (Co. AKTORmed GmbH, Neutraubling, Germany) in EES, which enables two-handed surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This two-sided study compares cut-suture time, operating time, postoperative complications, graft take rates, hearing results and quality of life in patients who underwent first stage tympanoplasty due to tympanic membrane perforation with intact ossicular chain conditions. 25 patients received classic EES (EES-, mean age: 28 +/- 21 years) and 15 received EES with the passive holder (EES+, mean age: 48 +/- 21 years)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Mean operating times (EES-: 96 +/- 38 (SD) min; EES+: 107 +/- 33 min), cut-suture times (EES-: 68 +/- 30 min; EES+: 73 +/- 31 min), complications, graft take rates and hearing results (preoperative air bone gap (ABG) (PTA4): 15 dB +/- SD 8 dB (EES-); 16 dB +/- SD 8 dB (EES+); postoperative ABG (PTA4): 11.25dB +/- SD 11.3dB (EES-); 14 dB +/- SD 10 dB (EES+)) did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between the two groups. Postoperative hearing results and quality of life tended to improve in both groups (p > 0.05)., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION</ovid:b>: The passive endoscope holder has been successfully applied during the course of the study. However, modifications of the endoscope holder and further studies are recommended focusing on positioning of grafts and prostheses to obtain conclusive results regarding the superiority of two-handed EES over one-handed conventional EES.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To explore the analgesic characteristics of ultrasound-guided great auricular nerve (GAN) block to further improve pain management., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Single-center, prospective, randomized, controlled, and double-blind preliminary clinical trial., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Thirty-seven patients who underwent middle ear surgery were included in this study: 15 in the GAN block group (the large ear nerve block [NB] group) and 22 in the traditional anesthesia group (control [CON] group). After induction of anesthesia, the NB group was given an ultrasound-guided GAN block (0.25 % Ropivacaine 2 mL), while the CON group was exempt from the GAN block. The patient's basic information, perioperative information, the region, and numeric rating scale of postoperative pain (at 1 hour, 6 hours, 12 hours, and 24 hours), and adverse reactions were recorded. Repeated measurement analysis, t test, and Fisher exact probability method were used for statistical analysis., <ovid:b>FINDINGS</ovid:b>: Compared with the CON group, the numeric rating scale in the NB group was lower after surgery (1 hour: 1.18 +/- 0.35 vs 0.27 +/- 0.20, P = .023; 6 hours: 1.82 +/- 0.37 vs 1.13 +/- 0.39, P = .203; 12 hours: 1.05 +/- 0.19 vs 0.20 +/- 0.10, P < .001; 24 hours: 0.55 +/- 0.17 vs 0.13 +/- 0.09, P = .029). In the NB group, the region of pain was merely concentrated in the ear canal. In the CON group, the pain extended to areas outside the ear canal, such as tragus and mastoid (at 12 hours, P = .006). There was no significant difference in the risk of postoperative adverse reactions between the two groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Ultrasound-guided GAN block can relieve patients' pain after middle ear surgery, especially in the area outside the ear canal.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The American Society of PeriAnesthesia Nurses.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aims of this study were to adapt the Swedish version of the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (IOI-HA) to the International Outcome Inventory for Alternative Interventions (IOI-AI) in the context of ear surgery (IOI-AI<ovid:sup>op</ovid:sup>) and to test the psychometric properties., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: The validated Swedish questionnaire IOI-HA was adapted to the IOI-AI<ovid:sup>op</ovid:sup> by omitting the question about hearing aid use and changing the term "hearing aid" to "surgery" in the remaining items. The validity, component structure and reliability of the IOI-AI<ovid:sup>op</ovid:sup> were assessed., <ovid:b>STUDY SAMPLE</ovid:b>: Subjects diagnosed with otosclerosis and undergoing stapedotomy were included in the study (n = 162)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: High mean scores were noted for all items. Ceiling effects were noted, most pronounced for the satisfaction item. Principal component analysis (PCA) yielded a two-component structure explaining 77.5% of the variance. The test-retest reliability measured by intra class correlation coefficient was >0.9, and the internal consistency coefficient measured by Cronbach's alfa was >0.8., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The IOI-AI<ovid:sup>op</ovid:sup> showed good psychometric properties. However, ceiling effects were observed. The two-component solution was in line with previous factor analyses of the IOI-HA and the IOI-AI. The comprehensive IOI-AI<ovid:sup>op</ovid:sup> is recommended as a useful tool to evaluate patient perspectives after ear surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS</ovid:b>: <ovid:i>COL1A1/2</ovid:i> osteogenesis imperfecta (<ovid:i>COL1A1/2</ovid:i>-OI) is characterized by fractures with minimal or absent trauma, variable dentinogenesis imperfecta (DI), and, in adult years, hearing loss. The clinical features of <ovid:i>COL1A1/2</ovid:i>-OI represent a continuum ranging from perinatal lethality to individuals with severe skeletal deformities, mobility impairments, and very short stature to nearly asymptomatic individuals with a mild predisposition to fractures, normal dentition, normal stature, and normal life span. Fractures can occur in any bone but are most common in the extremities. DI is characterized by gray or brown teeth that may appear translucent, wear down, and break easily. <ovid:i>COL1A1/2</ovid:i>-OI has been classified into four types based on clinical presentation and radiographic findings. This classification system can be helpful in providing information about prognosis and management for a given individual. The four more common OI types are now referred to as follows: Classic non-deforming OI with blue sclerae (previously OI type I). Perinatally lethal OI (previously OI type II). Progressively deforming OI (previously OI type III). Common variable OI with normal sclerae (previously OI type IV)., <ovid:b>DIAGNOSIS/TESTING</ovid:b>: The diagnosis of <ovid:i>COL1A1/2</ovid:i>-OI is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in <ovid:i>COL1A1</ovid:i> or <ovid:i>COL1A2</ovid:i> by molecular genetic testing., <ovid:b>MANAGEMENT</ovid:b>: <ovid:i>Treatment of manifestations:</ovid:i> Ideally, management is by a multidisciplinary team including specialists in medical management of OI, clinical genetics, orthopedics, rehabilitation medicine, pediatric dentistry, otology/otolaryngology, and mental health. Parents / other caregivers must practice safe handling techniques. Mainstays of treatment include: bracing of limbs depending on OI severity; orthotics to stabilize lax joints; physical activity; physical and occupational therapy to maximize bone stability, improve mobility, prevent contractures, prevent head and spine deformity, and improve muscle strengthening; mobility devices as needed; and pain management. Fractures are treated with: as short a period of immobility as is practical; small and lightweight casts; physical therapy as soon as casts are removed; and intramedullary rodding when indicated to provide anatomic positioning of limbs. Progressive scoliosis in severe OI may not respond well to conservative or surgical management. Bisphosphonates continue to be used most extensively in severely affected children with OI. Surgical treatment for basilar impression should be done in a center experienced in the necessary procedures. Dental care strives to maintain both primary and permanent dentition, a functional bite or occlusion, optimal gingival health, and overall appearance. Conductive hearing loss may be improved with middle ear surgery; later-onset sensorineural hearing loss is treated in the same manner as when caused by other conditions. Mental health support through psychiatry/psychology and appropriate social worker intervention can improve quality of life. <ovid:i>Prevention of secondary complications:</ovid:i> During general anesthesia, proper positioning on the operating room table and use of cushioning such as egg crate foam can help avoid fractures. <ovid:i>Surveillance:</ovid:i> Orthopedic evaluation with ancillary therapy services (physical and rehabilitation medicine) as indicated every three months until age one year, every six months from ages one to three years, and then annually or with any new fractures. Physical therapy evaluation in infancy for those with motor delays and as needed to improve mobility and function. CT and/or MRI examination with views across the base of the skull to evaluate for basilar impression if concerning signs or symptoms are present. Cervical spine flexion and extension radiographs in children able to cooperate with the examination or before participating in sporting activities in more mildly affected individuals. Twice-yearly dental visits beginning in early childhood or even infancy for those with (or at risk for) DI. Hearing evaluation at three- to five-year intervals from age five years until hearing loss is identified, then as indicated based on the nature and degree of hearing loss and associated interventions. <ovid:i>Agents/circumstances to be avoided:</ovid:i> Contact sports should be avoided., <ovid:b>GENETIC COUNSELING</ovid:b>: <ovid:i>COL1A1/2</ovid:i>-OI is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The proportion of affected individuals who represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence of the disorder in a family) varies by the severity of disease. Approximately 60% of probands with mild OI represent simplex cases. Virtually 100% of probands with progressively deforming or perinatally lethal OI represent simplex cases and have a <ovid:i>de novo</ovid:i> pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from a parent with somatic and/or germline mosaicism. Parental somatic and/or germline mosaicism is present in up to 16% of families. Each child of an individual with a dominantly inherited form of <ovid:i>COL1A1/2</ovid:i>-OI has a 50% chance of inheriting the causative variant and of developing some manifestations of OI. Prenatal testing in at-risk pregnancies can be performed by molecular genetic testing if the <ovid:i>COL1A1</ovid:i> or <ovid:i>COL1A2</ovid:i> causative variant has been identified in an affected relative. Ultrasound examination performed in a center with experience in diagnosing OI can be valuable in the prenatal diagnosis of the lethal form and most severe forms prior to 20 weeks' gestation; milder forms may be detected later in pregnancy if fractures or deformities occur.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 1993-2024, University of Washington, Seattle.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objectives:</ovid:b> To identify the predictors of tympanoplasty success including graft success, hearing outcomes, and recovery time. <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: Patients who underwent a tympanoplasty between January 2019 and July 2022 were enrolled. Hearing outcomes were measured by air-bone gap from pure tone. Demographic data of the patient, surgical parameters, and Ossiculoplasty Outcome Parameter Staging (OOPS) were reviewed and evaluated to predict the success of tympanoplasty using univariate and multivariate logistic or Cox regression analyzes. <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: Of 138 patients, 151 procedures were studied. At the 6-month follow-up visit, the overall graft success was 90.7% and the overall hearing success was 40.4%. There was a correlation between the OOPS index and postoperative hearing success (Spearman <ovid:i>r</ovid:i> = 0.322). Blood loss > 10 ml and OOPS >= 4 were independent predictors of hearing failure. Blocked aditus ad antrum and blood loss > 10 ml were independent predictors of prolonged recovery time. <ovid:b>Conclusions</ovid:b>: The OOPS index exhibits a strong predictive influence on hearing outcomes after tympanoplasty. A predictive model that combines the amount of blood loss and blockage of aditus ad antrum can serve as a useful tool in predicting postoperative recovery time.

T1  - Stapedectomy.

Y1  - 2024//
N2  - The goal of any stapes procedure is to restore the vibration of fluids within the cochlea; increasing communication secondary to increasing sound amplification, bringing hearing levels to acceptable thresholds. The stapedectomy procedure can be dated back to 1892, a time where Frederick L. Jack performed a double stapedectomy on a patient who was reportedly still hearing ten years after the procedure. John Shea, in the early 1950s, realized the significance of this procedure and birthed the idea of utilizing a prosthesis to mimic the stapes bone. On May 1, 1956, John J. Shea performed the first stapedectomy with the use of a Teflon stapes prosthesis in a female patient with otosclerosis - a complete success. The primary goal when operating on the stapes is to re-establish sound transmission through an ossicular chain that has likely been stiffened through the disease process known as otosclerosis. Otosclerosis, an otic capsule disease that involves absorption of compact bone and the redeposition of spongy-appearing, or spongiotic, bone, is the most common cause of acquired conductive hearing loss (CHL) as a result of stapes fixation. Otosclerosis will present in patients as an insidious onset of hearing loss that continues to progress. These patients will have difficulty with conversation, especially while chewing, and may hear better in noisy environments due to an occurrence known as the paracusis of Willis. On otoscopic examination, the provider may notice a red blush or discoloration over the promontory - a finding known as the Schwartze sign. Many etiologic factors have been studied, but none have been widely accepted as a cause. As Markou and Goudakos detail in their review, the primary insult remains unknown, and otosclerosis is generally considered to be a complex disease state caused by both genetic and environmental factors. Autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance remains the most accepted theory regarding genetic inheritance and is associated with nine possible chromosomal loci (COL1A1, and OTSC1 through OTSC8). Otosclerosis has been found to primarily affect white individuals, reaching as much as 12% of the population, with 0.3 to 0.4% presenting with clinical symptoms. Disease prevalence is lower in African Americans, Asians, and Native Americans. Gender might play a role, showing a slight female predominance with 1.5 to 2 women affected for every one symptomatic man. Stapedectomy can effectively treat the significant conductive hearing loss associated with otosclerosis through the reconstruction of the sound-conducting mechanism of the middle ear. Success rates of these procedures are routinely evaluated by observing the degree of closure of a patient's air-bone gap (ABG) per audiometric evaluation. The ABG is calculated by subtracting the postoperative bone conduction from the postoperative air conduction. A pure-tone average (PTA), or an average of the four tones associated with speech (0.5, 1, 2, and 3kHz), is utilized in these calculations. The minimum ABG that would require surgery is an averaged 20 dB difference resulting from the measurements of the key speech frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, and 3kHz). Many studies have compared stapedectomy to small fenestra stapedotomy, depicting no significant difference between the two techniques regarding the closure of the ABG, particularly when observing a patient's PTA. The author defines a stapedectomy as the total or subtotal removal of the stapes footplate. In contrast, a small fenestra stapedotomy is defined as a small hole created by laser or micro drill large enough for the placement of a piston prosthesis. The strongest factor for achieving the desired surgical outcome is the experience of the surgeon who is utilizing the ever-changing techniques and technologies in this field.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024, StatPearls Publishing LLC.

N2  - Surgeons' dissatisfaction with the surgical treatment for tympanic membrane perforations results leads to the constant improvement of the surgical technique and the emergence of new techniques. Difficulties arise in the surgical treatment of rheumatological patients treated with immunosuppressive drugs due to the high potential risk of postoperative complications. The most promising direction in this cohort of patients can be considered the use of laser exposure techniques under endoscopic control. The experience of performing endoscopic laser myringoplasty in 9 children aged from 6 to 16 years (mean age 10+/-3 years) with tympanic membrane perforation up to 6 mm in diameter and juvenile idiopathic arthritis treated with methotrexate and tocilizumab is presented. The effectiveness of the studied technique in relation to the closure of perforation of the tympanic membrane was 66.7%. Considering that in children, reconstructive ear surgery is considered less effective than in adults, and the presence of chronic systemic rheumatoid disease and immunosuppressive therapy are risk factors for recurrence of perforation after tympanoplasty, these results can be considered successful. The presented method is promising in this cohort of patients for the restoration of small tympanic membrane defects. However, further research is needed.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: A review was undertaken to evaluate the peer-reviewed literature on three areas of tinnitus management for the following Key Questions (KQs): (1) measures used to assess patients for management needs (KQ1); (2) effectiveness of treatments (KQ2); and (3) identification of prognostic factors (KQ3)., <ovid:b>DATA SOURCES</ovid:b>: MEDLINE<ovid:sup> R</ovid:sup>, Embase<ovid:sup> R</ovid:sup>, CINAHL<ovid:sup> R</ovid:sup>, PsycINFO<ovid:sup> R</ovid:sup>, AMED<ovid:sup>&#xa9;</ovid:sup>, and Cochrane CENTRAL were searched from January 1970 to June 2012. An extensive grey literature search, which included documents from regulatory and tinnitus-related organizations, was also undertaken., <ovid:b>REVIEW METHODS</ovid:b>: Standardized systematic review methodology was employed. Eligibility criteria included English-language studies of adults with subjective idiopathic (nonpulsatile) tinnitus; excluded studies involved tinnitus as the result of middle-ear pathologies or focused on methods to determine psychosomatic tinnitus. For KQ2, all pharmacological/food supplement, medical/surgical, sound/technological, and psychological/behavioral interventions aimed at ameliorating tinnitus symptoms were eligible (except stapedectomy or tympanoplasty). Randomized controlled trials with placebo controls or head-to-head trials were eligible for all KQs., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: From 9,725 citations, 52 eligible publications were extracted for data. None were eligible for KQ1 or KQ3. From the 52 publications eligible for KQ2, 17 evaluated pharmacological interventions; 11 evaluated medical interventions (low-level laser, acupuncture, transcranial magnetic stimulation); 5 evaluated sound technologies; and 19 evaluated psycholocal/behavioral interventions. Data on adverse effects were generally poorly collected and reported., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: There is low strength of evidence (SOE) indicating that cognitive behavioral therapy interventions improve tinnitus-specific quality of life relative to inactive controls. For pharmacological interventions, SOE is low for improvements to subjective loudness from neurotransmitter drugs versus placebo; insufficient for antidepressants, other drugs, and food supplements with respect to subjective loudness; and insufficient for all other outcomes. There is insufficient SOE to suggest that medical interventions improve outcomes relative to inactive controls; sleep and global quality of life were not evaluated for medical interventions. The SOE for the adverse effect of sedation in pharmacological studies was judged insufficient. Future research should address the substantial gaps identified for KQ1 and KQ3. For KQ2, future research should concentrate on improving collection of adverse effects, calculating sample size, and specifying doses for interventions.

N2  - OBJECTIVE : : Physicians and patients alike have concerns regarding exposing in vivo implanted metal stapes prostheses to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. As MRI scanners become more powerful, the possibility for stapes prosthesis displacement due to ferromagnetic forces increases. It is hypothesized that some metal stapes prostheses may be exposed to powerful MRI scanners without leading to potential adversities for patients. STUDY DESIGN: : Literature review, retrospective case review, and physician survey. SETTINGS : : Tertiary care, University Medical Center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: : A review of the medical literature,a retrospective case review, and a clinical survey were performed. <ovid:br/>RESULTS: : In the history of stapes prostheses, 1 adverse patient outcome was causally substantiated when a defective stapes prosthesis was exposed to an MRI field. Otherwise, a review of the literature on experiments investigating stapes prostheses and MRI fields revealed a lack of any adverse clinical reports. In addition, 2 physician's surveys revealed no other cases of symptoms or damage to the ears of patients with stapes prostheses that had been exposed to an MRI scanner. CONCLUSION : : All patients with a metallic stapes prosthesis may be sent to the MRI scanner, with the exception of 1 specific defective prosthesis type. The exception is a 1987 accidental mismanufacture of several lots of McGee pistons with a magnetic alloy. Patients with these specifically identified lots of McGee pistons should go to a computed tomographic scanner or be reimplanted with another prosthesis if MRI scans are mandatory. It would be advisable for manufacturers to use nonferromagnetic metals such as titanium for production of future stapes prostheses.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes after endoscopic and microscopic type I tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Randomized controlled trials, two-arm prospective studies, and retrospective studies were included., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched until March 1, 2022 using the combinations of search terms: "endoscopic," "microscopic," and "tympanoplasty.", <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Two independent reviewers utilized the abovementioned search strategy to identify eligible studies. If any uncertainty existed regarding eligibility, a third reviewer was consulted. Primary outcome measures were graft success rate, air-bone gap (ABG) improvement, and operative time. Secondary outcomes were the rate of need for canalplasty, the proportion of self-rated excellent cosmetic results, and pain visual analog scale (VAS)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Forty-three studies enrolled a total of 3712 patients who were undergoing type I tympanoplasty and were finally included. The pooled result showed endoscopic approach was significantly associated with shorter operative time (difference in means: -20.021, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -31.431 to -8.611), less need for canalplasty (odds ratio [OR]: 0.065, 95% CI: 0.026-0.164), more self-rated excellent cosmetic results (OR: 87.323, 95% CI: 26.750-285.063), and lower pain VAS (difference in means: -2.513, 95% CI: -4.737 to -0.228). No significant differences in graft success rate or ABG were observed between the two procedures., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic type I tympanoplasty provides a similar graft success rate, improvement in ABG, and reperforation rate to microscopic tympanoplasty with a shorter operative time, better self-rated cosmetic results, and less pain. Unless contraindicated, the endoscopic approach should be the procedure of choice in type I tympanoplasty.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.

N2  - Morphometry of pinna may change following ear surgeries. This study gives information about postoperative changes following ear surgeries. This study aims to measure the variation of ear morphology following surgery and to correlate the type of surgery with post-operative variations. Eighty patients with Chronic Otitis Media(COM) undergoing surgery by post aural approach were grouped into Modified Radical Mastoidectomy (MRM), Cortical Mastoidectomy + Tympanoplasty (CM + TM) and Tympanoplasty groups(TM). The MRM, CM + TM and TM groups had 14, 46 and 20 participants respectively. Various morphometric measurements were taken pre and post operatively. In all groups, the mean Concho-Mastoid Angle (CMA) was increased post operatively, with increase of 11.1 degrees in MRM (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> value-0.002), 8.9 degrees in CM + TM (p value-0.000) and 4.8 degrees (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> value- 0.657) in TM group. Similarly, the Cepahlo-auricular distances (D1 and D2) showed statistically significant changes in MRM and CM + TM groups (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> value < 0.05). Mean CMA of MRM group compared with other groups did not show any statistically significant difference. However, when the CMA of CM + TM group was compared with TM group showed significant difference of 14.53 degree (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> value 0.002). Similarly, the D1 and D2 showed statistically significant changes between the CM + TM and TM groups (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> value 0.005 and 0.000 respectively). Prominence of pinna following ear surgery is a not a myth. It happens mostly in cases requiring drilling of the mastoid, rather than Tympanoplasty alone. This needs to be explained to the patient beforehand to prevent any confusion post operatively.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2023.

N2  - Exploring diverse biomaterials and implants in the ear, nose, and throat by understanding adverse effects and post-usage events. Literature was obtained from Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science. A comprehensive analysis was conducted on original research studies, case reports, and case series spanning from December 2010 to May 2022. Our analysis underscores that the effectiveness of cochlear implants (CIs) relies on factors such as biocompatibility, anti-inflammatory measures, and fibrosis reduction. Although silicone is employed in otologic applications, allergic reactions leading to CI extrusion are rare. In the context of partial ossicular replacement prostheses or total ossicular replacement prostheses, polyethylene grafts (Teflon) are utilized, and Nitinol-pistons are employed in stapedotomy, with adverse consequences encompassing graft extrusion and residual perforation. Chronic sphenoid sinusitis is linked to the use of Medpor porous polyethylene implants in sellar reconstruction during skull-based surgeries. Injectable collagen preparations in vocal cord paralysis lead to submucosal deposits and resultant dysphonia. Montgomery T-tubes are employed for subglottic stenosis but are associated with granulation tissue formation. Metallic tracheostomy tubes give rise to secondary foreign bodies, and double-lumen tracheostomy tubes are prone to biofilm formation. Despite numerous research studies, there remains a necessity for the refinement of implant designs to mitigate complications and enhance the overall quality of life for patients.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright: &#xa9; 2024 National Journal of Maxillofacial Surgery.

N2  - Background The surgical management of chronic otitis media (COM) with squamous disease is canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWDM). Canal wall down procedures require the obliteration of the newly formed cavity to mitigate complications. Soft tissue flaps, including Rambo flap, Hong Kong flap, Palva flap, and inferior-based fascio-periosteal flap, as well as autologous bone pate, have been the most successful and commonly used materials for obliteration over the past two decades. Although each flap has its advantages, the Palva flap is considered superior, primarily because of its ease of use and the simplicity of its design. In this study, we intend to evaluate the effectiveness of mastoid obliteration using autologous bone pate with Palva flap compared to Palva flap (post-auricular fibro-periosteal soft tissue) in patients who underwent CWDM. Methods Sixty-two patients with COM with squamous disease were included in the study. The patients underwent CWDM with tympanoplasty and meatoplasty, followed by cavity obliteration using two different methods: group A - obliteration with Palva flap (post-auricular fibro-periosteal soft tissue) and group B - obliteration with Palva flap and bone pate. The patients were evaluated for cavity problems on post-operative days 21, 30, 60, 90, and 180, based on a 10-point scale compiled from the literature. Results Our study found that the majority of patients had right-sided disease and were between 41 and 60 years of age. Five out of sixty-two (8.1%) patients developed cavity problems, three in group A (9.7%) and two in group B (6.5%). The incidence of cavity problems was almost the same in both groups. The cavity problems were as follows: vertigo (1/62, 1.6%), surgical site infection (2/62, 3.2%), and graft failure (2/62, 3.2%). However, there were no statistically significant differences (p-value: 0.62) between either of the obliteration methods in terms of mitigating cavity problems. Conclusion Post-auricular soft tissue and post-auricular soft tissue with autologous bone pate in the obliteration of the CWDM cavity provided similar results in terms of mitigating cavity problems.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Suriya Luke Rathnakumar et al.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objectives</ovid:b>: Although various stapedotomy and stapedectomy techniques exist, anchoring the piston can be challenging. We present a novel surgical approach for treating congenital stapes malformations with an atypical facial nerve trajectory., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: This is a case of a 7-year-old boy presenting with bilateral conductive hearing loss. Prior attempts at tympanoplasty had proven unsuccessful in improving his hearing. Presurgical imaging studies revealed an unusual anatomical configuration, with the facial nerve positioned inferior to the oval window. This anatomical variation precluded the use of conventional prosthesis-anchoring techniques typically employed in stapedotomies. Thus, we devised an innovative approach, opting to anchor the prosthesis to the short process of the incus., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: This novel technique circumvented the atypical course of the facial nerve, allowing for successful reconstruction of the ossicular chain. The patient demonstrated an acceptable improvement (30 dB gain) in hearing 1-year post-surgery, with no reported complications., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: This case underscores the critical importance of adapting surgical techniques to address the unique anatomical challenges that may arise in the context of congenital ear malformations. It also highlights the potential of the short process of the incus as a viable alternative anchoring site for stapes prostheses, thereby improving the outcomes of such complex cases. This technique not only restored the patient's hearing but also contributed valuable insights into the management of similar cases, potentially improving the quality of life for individuals with rare and challenging anatomical variations., <ovid:b>Level of evidence</ovid:b>: 5.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2025 The Author(s).

N2  - Otosclerosis is a well-known disease which mainly affects middle-aged female patients, causing conductive or mixed hearing loss. Diagnosis is essentially made through a complete audiometric battery testing, while treatment substantially relies on stapes surgery. In this study, we analyzed audiometric and Quality-of-Life data from 33 patients in order to refine the surgical indications (unilateral versus bilateral stapes surgery) and assess the best technique (stapedotomy versus partial stapedectomy) and timing of treatment. The original questionnaire OTOS, in the Italian language, was administered to all patients. In this study, most of the patients were female (18/33), with a mean age of 53 years old. Both surgical techniques appear to be effective with no significant difference in post-operative Air Bone Gap. OTOS questionnaire appeared to be effective in assessing quality of life in patients treated by stapes surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective</ovid:b>: To explore the historical evolution of surgical techniques for otosclerosis treatment, viewed through the lens of human temporal bone pathology to aid in understanding the disease and refining surgical interventions., <ovid:b>Data sources</ovid:b>: A review of historical literature on otosclerosis, surgical techniques, and otopathological findings was conducted. Eight temporal bone specimens from the Paparella Otopathology & Pathogenesis Laboratory, University of Minnesota, and one from the University of California, Los Angeles, were analyzed., <ovid:b>Review methods</ovid:b>: We selected two temporal bones from donors who underwent four different types of surgical procedures for otosclerosis: stapes mobilization, fenestration, stapedectomy, and stapedotomy. One successful and one complication case was selected for each procedure. Histopathological analysis was performed to assess the outcomes and complications associated with each technique., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: The study chronicles the progression of otosclerosis surgery from the stapes mobilization to modern stapedectomy and stapedotomy techniques. Initial procedures, like stapes mobilization and fenestration, yielded limited and temporary results with significant complications. The introduction of stapedectomy marked a significant improvement, with better long-term outcomes. Histopathological analysis revealed insights into the causes of surgical failures and complications., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: Otosclerosis surgery has evolved significantly, driven by advances in otopathology and surgical technology. While earlier techniques offered limited success, modern procedures like stapedectomy and stapedotomy provide improved outcomes and fewer complications. Ongoing research promises further advancements in the field, improving patient care and surgical efficacy., <ovid:b>Level of evidence</ovid:b>: NA.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>Background</ovid:b>: Otosclerosis is characterized by abnormal bone growth in the otie capsule. Nowadays, stapedotomy is commonly used for otosclerosis treatment. Currently, postoperative dizziness has been associated with stapedotomy. In 1981, intratympanic dexamethasone was utilized to manage inner ear disorders like tinnitus and acute sensorineural hearing loss. However, there is much uncertainty regarding the effect and safety of topical steroid therapy in the middle ear during stapedotomy. In the present study, we assessed the effect of topical steroid therapy during stapedotomy on postoperative dizziness., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: Otosclerosis patients eligible for stapedotomy were randomly divided into two groups based on dexamethasone administration or placebo. Audiometric and tympanometry results were observed and recorded for the involved frequencies. The Dizziness Handicap Inventory was used to quantify patient perceptions of dizziness and balance issues. Audiometry and dizziness assessments were repeated at discharge and 4 months after the operation., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: The study comprised 72 otosclerosis patients undergoing stapedotomy. At discharge, the intervention group showed a significant reduction in the incidence of dizziness compared to the placebo group. However, in the 4-month follow-up after the operation, both groups experienced a decrease in dizziness incidence, with no significant difference between them. There was also no significant difference in audiometric levels between the two groups. Interestingly, the intervention group had a significantly lower need for systemic anti-dizziness drugs after surgery compared to the control group., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: Topical dexamethasone during stapedotomy effectively minimizes dizziness at discharge and reduces the need for postoperative anti-dizziness medication., <ovid:b>Level of evidence</ovid:b>: 2.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.

T1  - Procedures for restoring vestibular disorders.
A1  - Walther, Leif Erik
Y1  - 2005//
Y2  - 20050928//
N2  - This paper will discuss therapeutic possibilities for disorders of the vestibular organs and the neurons involved, which confront ENT clinicians in everyday practice. Treatment of such disorders can be tackled either symptomatically or causally. The possible strategies for restoring the body's vestibular sense, visual function and co-ordination include medication, as well as physical and surgical procedures. Prophylactic or preventive measures are possible in some disorders which involve vertigo (bilateral vestibulopathy, kinetosis, height vertigo, vestibular disorders when diving (Tables 1 (Tab. 1) and 2 (Tab. 2)). Glucocorticoid and training therapy encourage the compensation of unilateral vestibular loss. In the case of a bilateral vestibular loss, it is important to treat the underlying disease (e.g. Cogan's disease). Although balance training does improve the patient's sense of balance, it will not restore it completely. In the case of Meniere's disease, there are a number of medications available to either treat bouts or to act as a prophylactic (e.g. dimenhydrinate or betahistine). In addition, there are non-ablative (sacculotomy) as well as ablative surgical procedures (e.g. labyrinthectomy, neurectomy of the vestibular nerve). In everyday practice, it has become common to proceed with low risk therapies initially. The physical treatment of mild postural vertigo can be carried out quickly and easily in outpatients (repositioning or liberatory maneuvers). In very rare cases it may be necessary to carry out a semicircular canal occlusion.Isolated disturbances of the otolith function or an involvement of the otolith can be found in roughly 50% of labyrinth disturbances. A specific surgical procedure to selectively block the otolith organs is currently being studied. When an external perilymph fistula involving loss of perilymph is suspected, an exploratory tympanotomy involving also the round and oval window niches must be carried out. A traumatic rupture of the round window membrane can, for example, also be caused by an implosive inner ear barotrauma during the decompression phase of diving. Dehiscence of the anterior semicircular canal, a relatively rare disorder, can be treated conservatively (avoiding stimuli which cause dizziness), by non-ablative "resurfacing" or by "plugging" the semicircular canal. A perilymph fistula can cause a Tullio-phenomenon resulting from a traumatic dislocation or hypermobility of the stapes, which can be surgically corrected. Vestibular disorders can also result from otosurgical therapy. When balance disorders persist following stapedectomy it is necessary to carry out a revision operation in order to either exclude a perilymph fistula or shorten the piston. Surgically reducing the size of open mastoid cavities (using for example porous hydroxylapatite or cartilage) can result in a reduction of vertiginous symptoms while nursing or during exposure to ambient air. Vestibular disturbances can occur both before and after vestibular nerve surgery (acoustic neuroma). Initially, good vestibular compensation can be expected after surgically removing the acoustic neuroma. An aberrant regeneration of nerve fibers of the vestibulocochlear nerve has been suggested as a cause for secondary worsening. Episodes of vertigo can be caused by an irritation of the vestibular nerve (vascular loop). Neurovascular decompression is generally regarded as the best surgical therapy. In the elderly, vestibular disturbances can severely limit quality of life and are often aggravated by multiple comorbidities. Antivertiginous drugs (e.g. dimenhydrinate) in combination with movement training can significantly reduce symptoms. Administering antivertiginous drugs over varying periods of time (e.g. transdermal scopolamine application via patches) as well as kinetosis training can be used as both prophylactically and as a therapy for kinetosis. Exposure training should be used as a prophylactic for height vertigo.

N2  - Chronic Otitis Media is a global health problem causing significant morbidity of life. Various medical and surgical treatment modalities are being used for the treatment of Chronic Otitis Media. Surgical treatment is the definitive option which includes different surgical procedures, all of which have been designed to attain the same goals of eradicating disease and achieve a safe and dry ear with closure of tympanic membrane perforations. Various graft materials are being used for the closure of tympanic membrane perforations like autografts, isografts, allografts and xenografts, each having its own advantages and limitations. The trend towards increasingly less invasive medical procedures, with shorter hospitalisation stay has led to demand for materials to replace autologous grafts, one such material being the collagen. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcome of myringoplasty in small to medium sized perforations using collagen sheet as the graft material. In the period from November 2018 to May 2020, 50 patients after fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were taken up for myringoplasty. They underwent myringoplasty using transcanal approach and collagen sheet was used to close the tympanic membrane perforation. Post-operatively, patients were treated with antibiotics and regularly followed up. Otoendoscopy was done at the end of 1st month and 3rd month. At the end of 3 months, patients were evaluated for graft uptake and pure tone audiometry repeated to evaluate the post-operative hearing gain. In this study, we examined a total of 50 patients with 25 males and 25 females (50%). The mean age of our patients was 29.42 years, ranging from 18 to 60 years; with almost 66% between 21 and 40 years. Treatment was considered successful if there was complete closure of tympanic membrane perforations. Of the 50 patients that were included; graft uptake was noted in 46 patients i.e. in 92%, closure was achieved at the end of 3 months. Four failures in our study were due to infections. In this study, the graft uptake following myringoplasty was analyzed with statistically significant objective parameters like age, gender, size of perforation, laterality of disease, etiology of CSOM that affect the success of tympanoplasty. It was observed that small sized perforations had more chances of graft uptake. Post-operative hearing outcomes were also evaluated and was found to be statistically significant. Collagen sheet provided promising results as a graft material for myringoplasty and the graft uptake rates were comparable to the success rates of other conventional autologous grafts. Post operatively, significant improvement in hearing was also noted.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2023.

N2  - Our study aims to illustrate the clinical picture of otosclerosis in patients and the effect of surgery on the bone conduction thresholds compared to audiometry tests before surgery. A retrospective study included 36 patients that fit the inclusion criteria based on the patient's files and Pure Tone Audiometry of the patients before and after surgery. The questionnaire used is attached at the end of the study. According to Our sample, 77.8% were females, and 22.2% were males. The youngest was 17 years old, the eldest was 61, and the mean age was 38.2 years old. Hearing loss was the most common symptom in 100% of patients, while tinnitus was found in 66.7% and vertigo in 11%. The Injury was bilateral in 72% of the cases. Before surgery, the mean air conduction threshold (ACT) was 54.7 dB, the mean value of the air-bone gap (ABG) was 38.3 dB, and the mean bone conduction threshold (BCT) was 16.1 dB. Meanwhile, after the surgery, the mean BCT was 18.2 dB. Otosclerosis is more common in middle-aged females. Most cases are bilateral. Two-thirds of the cases of hearing loss were associated with tinnitus, while only a few had vertigo. A slight increase was noticed in BCTs after surgeries, especially at 4000 Hz. Stapedectomy caused a noticeable decrease in the values of BCTs on the frequency 4000 Hz. Stapedotomy improved the BCTs after surgery by about 5.3 dB at 4000 Hz.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2023.

N2  - <ovid:b>Background:</ovid:b> This study presents a comprehensive analysis of cholesteatoma of the middle ear, focusing on its clinical presentation, diagnostic imaging, and treatment outcomes. Cholesteatomas are defined by the keratinized squamous epithelium within the middle ear, leading to significant bone erosion, often affecting the ossicular chain and surrounding structures. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Methods:</ovid:b> The study explores various mechanisms involved in cholesteatoma progression, including enzymatic lysis, inflammatory responses, and neurotrophic disturbances. The study conducted a retrospective clinical and statistical review of 580 patients over a 20-year period (2003-2023), highlighting the role of advanced imaging, including computed tomography (CT) and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), in preoperative planning and postoperative follow-up. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> Findings revealed that early detection and intervention are crucial in preventing severe complications such as intracranial infection and hearing loss. Surgical treatment primarily involved tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy, with a recurrence rate of 1.55% within two years. The study underscores the importance of integrating imaging advancements into clinical decision-making to enhance patient outcomes and suggests further investigation into molecular mechanisms underlying cholesteatoma progression and recurrence. Histopathological and microbiological analysis was performed to identify pathological patterns and microbial agents. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Conclusions:</ovid:b> The study highlights the importance of early diagnosis and intervention to prevent complications such as intracranial infections and permanent hearing loss, while also emphasizing the role of advanced imaging techniques in the management and long-term monitoring of cholesteatoma patients.

N2  - The stapedius muscle is a very small skeletal muscle that connects the pyramidal eminence to the stapes through the stapedial tendon. It is very rare that stapedius muscle and tendon are congenitally absent; however, this has been reported previously in the literature and the current report. Our patient was a middle-aged male who presented with hearing loss. On clinical assessment, there were no local or systemic signs and symptoms. However, after an audiological assessment that showed bilaterally mixed hearing loss, the patient was scheduled for left ear exploration and stapedectomy as a case of otosclerosis. Upon exploration, we discovered an absent stapedial muscle tendon and a non-prominent pyramid. Being aware of the stapedius muscle and tendon anomalies is substantial for surgeons performing interventions for middle ear pathologies, and more specifically while operating on patients with otosclerosis, as they showed absent stapedial tendon reflex preoperatively. Although these anomalies are not commonly seen, awareness of their existence and careful interpretation of imaging studies remain crucial.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Alqarni et al.

N2  - Chronic otitis media (COM) poses significant challenges globally, affecting millions with hearing impairment and associated morbidities. This prospective study aimed to compare the surgical outcomes of type I tympanoplasty with and without canaloplasty in adolescent patients with COM, focusing on hearing improvement and graft success rates. Sixty-eight patients aged 11-18 years, diagnosed with inactive mucosal disease and conductive hearing loss, were enrolled from 01 January 2022 to 01 July 2023. They were randomly assigned to Group A (type I tympanoplasty with canaloplasty, <ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 34) or Group B (type I tympanoplasty alone, <ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 34). Preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluations were conducted to assess air-bone gap closure and hearing thresholds. Graft uptake was evaluated at three months post-surgery. Both groups showed significant improvement in hearing postoperatively (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.01). Group A exhibited a higher rate of successful graft uptake (94.11%) compared to Group B (91.17%), though this difference was statistically significant (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = 0.01). Canaloplasty in Group A facilitated enhanced visualization of the tympanic membrane and improved graft placement, contributing to favorable outcomes. The study underscores the potential benefits of combining canaloplasty with type I tympanoplasty in adolescent patients with COM, emphasizing improved hearing outcomes and graft success rates. These findings support the incorporation of canaloplasty to optimize surgical outcomes and enhance patient outcomes in chronic otitis media management.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2024.

N2  - The aim of present study was to observe the effect of topical application of manuka honey in healing in the healing of postoperative mastoid cavity. A total of 100 patients diagnosed with chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy, Manuka honey-soaked roller gauze pack was placed on Day 10 and was removed on day 17 and manuka honey was applied on day 17. Cavity was assessed on day 47 and day 90 on follow-up. Otoendoscopy was done on every visit to assess mastoid cavity. The primary outcome measure was the creation of a dry cavity as measured by a semi-quantitative scale as described by Merchant et al. Then Mastoid Cavity Healing Score was calculated on every visit and scoring was done at the end. On intragroup comparison it appeared that both the treatment methods exhibited improvised merchant grade score with the course of time (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i>-value = < 0.001). At 47th day and 90th day, the healing score in Group A was significantly higher than in Group B [<ovid:i>p</ovid:i>-value = < 0.001 and 0.001] respectively. We recommend Manuka honey as an adjunct to achieve a safe, dry ear in view of faster epithelization after mastoidectomy.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>Background and objectives</ovid:b>: Training in surgical specialties has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. A study was carried out to further analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific aspects of clinical, training, and research activities performed by the otolaryngology residents in Spain., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted during the last two weeks of February 2021. The study consisted of an online survey taken by otolaryngology residents who had undertaken one-year continuing training from February 15, 2020, to February 15, 2021, and consisted of 26 questions exploring the impact of the COVID-19 on the health of the ENT residents and training activities. Categorical variables were reported as frequency and percentage. When indicated, Pearsons Chi-square test (chi<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>) with Yates's correction and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) were used., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: 143 completed surveys were received from 264 residents (54.17%). 36 residents (25.2%) have suffered from the disease due to SARS-CoV-2. Most of them only developed mild symptoms (86.1%), with 3 requiring hospitalization (8.3%). The origin of infection was unknown in all reported cases and the need for confinement was principally due to either attending an asymptomatic patient in 9 cases (6.3%) or to being supposedly in close contact with an asymptomatic person in 22 (15.4%). 60.1% of the residents surveyed reported having lost more than 6 months of their training period, and in 18.8% of cases, it was as high as 10 and 12 months. There has been a reduction of more than 75% of what was planned in surgical training (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .05) of tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy, stapedectomy, cochlear implants, endoscopic sinonasal and anterior skull base surgery, septoplasty and turbinoplasty., <ovid:b>Conclusions</ovid:b>: The decline in ENT activity and residents having to assist in other COVID-19 units during the most critical moments of the pandemic, has caused the main reduction in their training capacity. Contagion mainly occurred through contact with asymptomatic carriers during patient care and through supposedly close contact with asymptomatic carriers. Virtual activities have been widely accepted, but they have not completely replaced all residents' training needs. Measures should be implemented to recover lost training, especially surgical practical learning in otology and rhinology.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Sociedad Espanola de Otorrinolaringologia y Cirugia de Cabeza y Cuello.

N2  - With the increase in life expectancy and awareness, more otorhinolaryngologic surgeries are being performed in the elderly population. Otorhinolaryngologic surgeries like septoplasty, tympanoplasty, and dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) surgeries are elective surgeries for improving the quality of life. However, post-operative medication can entail a risk to life or serious side effects in elderly patients. It is seen that before any surgery, the patients have undergone various tests and investigations to monitor the nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity primarily to gauge medication clearance and organ damage. However, the effects of various post-operative medications on the central nervous system and cardiovascular system are less well-discussed. Harmful effects of various drugs especially antibiotics given post-operatively in otorhinolaryngology on the central nervous and cardiovascular system are not frequently reported, and the underlying mechanisms may be unclear or conflicting. Older individuals have a greater chance of experiencing serious drug reactions due to physiologic changes affecting pharmacokinetic processes. Some frailty risk indices can be used to determine the cognitive and physiological conditions in geriatric patients so that the outcome of using antibiotics in the post-operative period on the neuropsychiatric and cardiovascular systems can be predicted. This review aims to summarise the research on the neurotoxic and cardiac effects of antibiotics used in otorhinolaryngology practice in the post-operative period in elderly patients, with a focus on signs of psychosis, delirium, cognitive impairment, syncope, cardiac arrest, angina-like symptoms, etc. This review also studies some frailty risk indices that can be used to predict the neuropsychiatric and cardiac side effects due to polypharmacy, especially antibiotics. Hence, post-operative risks can be predetermined and a protocol for further management can be established.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Jain et al.

N2  - Introduction: Chronic Suppurative Otitis Media (CSOM) significantly impacts auditory functions and overall quality of life. Although tympanoplasty is recognized for its auditory benefits, its broader psychological impacts in CSOM patients remain underexplored. <ovid:br/>Method: In this sequential explanatory mixed-methods study, 100 adult CSOM patients undergoing tympanoplasty were evaluated from January 2022 to December 2023. The study integrated quantitative assessments (Pure-Tone Audiometry, Speech Audiometry, COMOT-15, HADS) and qualitative data from semi-structured interviews. <ovid:br/>Results: Post-tympanoplasty, patients exhibited a notable improvement in auditory functions, with an average decrease in Pure-Tone Audiometry (PTA) thresholds by 30 dB and a 28% increase in speech recognition scores. Psychological assessments reflected a significant enhancement in quality of life, with an average decrease of 25 points in COMOT-15 scores, and reductions in HADS anxiety and depression scores by an average of 7 and 6 points, respectively. Qualitative interviews reinforced these results, emphasizing improved social interactions and emotional well-being. A strong correlation was observed between the auditory and psychological improvements. Conclusion : The study demonstrates that tympanoplasty in CSOM patients leads to significant auditory and psychological improvements, highlighting the necessity of a comprehensive treatment approach. This underscores the importance of considering both physical and mental health in CSOM management., <ovid:b>Supplementary Information</ovid:b>: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12070-024-04907-1.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>Background</ovid:b>: Otosclerosis is one of the most frequent causes of conductive hearing loss in adults. Surgical treatment is considered to be the gold standard for this disease. Endoscopic stapedectomy is a new approach for the treatment of otosclerosis that requires a bloodless field., <ovid:b>Aim of the Study</ovid:b>: To determine whether the routine use of beta blockers as a premedication can improve the operative field in endoscopic stapedectomy or not., <ovid:b>Patients and Methods</ovid:b>: Sixty patients aged from 18 to 50 years, undergoing endoscopic stapedectomy, were included in this prospective, randomized, double blinded, placebo-controlled study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either metoprolol 100 mg ( group 1) or a placebo, vitamin tablet, (group 2) 60 min before surgery., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: The age, gender, body weight and ASA physical status were comparable between the two groups. The average blood loss in the placebo group was significantly greater than in the metoprolol group, but the time of operation in the metoprolol group was not significantly shorter. The surgical field was assessed using the Fromme-Boezaart scale, and those who received metoprolol had considerably cleaner (p0.001) surgical fields. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) didn't differ statistically significant at basal measurement up to 30 min after anesthesia induction while it was significantly lower in the metoprolol group after 30 min of induction up to end of surgery (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.001). The heart rate was also significantly lower (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.001) in patients who received metoprolol from prior to anesthesia induction up to end of surgery., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: metoprolol significantly improves visual clarity and hemodynamics during endoscopic stapedectomy.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate the association between mucociliary function of the Eustachian tube using the Saccharin test preoperatively and its correlation with dynamic slow-motion video endoscopy on the outcome of Type-I Tympanoplasty in patients with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media., <ovid:b>METHODOLOGY</ovid:b>: Eighty patients diagnosed with inactive mucosal chronic otitis media who underwent Type-I Tympanoplasty were included in the study. Preoperative assessment of Eustachian tube function was conducted using the Saccharin test. Results of this test were categorized as normal, partial, or gross dysfunction. Dynamic slow-motion video endoscopy was performed to assess motion and pathological factors of the Eustachian tube. Results were evaluated based on a previously validated Visual Analogue Score (VAS). Patients were followed up postoperatively for 3 months., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The proportion of patients with surgical failure at the end of the 1st and 3rd month postoperatively was significantly higher in cases of gross Eustachian tube dysfunction compared to those with normal and partial dysfunction (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i>-value < 0.0001 and <ovid:i>p</ovid:i>-value = 0.0001, respectively). Preoperative VAS scores in normal Eustachian tubes were significantly higher compared to those with partial dysfunction and gross dysfunction., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The Saccharin test is a valuable tool for preoperative evaluation of mucociliary clearance of the Eustachian tube, and dynamic slow-motion video endoscopy serves as a useful adjunct in predicting the outcome of Type-I Tympanoplasty. Routine evaluation of mucociliary clearance function of the Eustachian tube should be included in the preoperative workup for patients undergoing Tympanoplasty to achieve optimal surgical outcomes.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2024.

N2  - Background Chronic otitis media (COM) often necessitates tympanoplasty to repair the tympanic membrane. While conventional postaural tympanoplasty (PA) is well-established, endoscopic transcanal tympanoplasty (ET) is gaining traction for its minimally invasive benefits. This study aims to compare these two surgical techniques regarding their anatomical and functional outcomes and assess the role of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in improving these outcomes. Material and methods This prospective comparative study was conducted at Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital, involving 60 patients with COM. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either ET or PA, with each group further subdivided based on PRP use. Preoperative evaluations included auditory function tests and diagnostic endoscopy. Postoperative assessments were performed at seven days, one month, and three months to evaluate graft acceptance and hearing improvement using pure tone audiometry (PTA). Statistical analyses included the chi-square test, t-test, ANOVA, and paired t-test. Results The study included patients with a mean age of 38.1 years, predominantly female (71.67%). ET demonstrated superior anatomical outcomes compared to PA, with higher graft acceptance rates and better hearing improvements. The average hearing gain was 10.4 dB in the ET group versus 8.1 dB in the PA group. PRP uses enhanced graft acceptance and hearing restoration across both surgical approaches, contributing to better overall outcomes. Conclusion ET offers significant advantages over conventional postaural tympanoplasty in terms of anatomical and functional results. PRP further improves surgical outcomes, making ET a preferable option for tympanoplasty in COM patients. These findings support the broader adoption of ET and PRP to enhance patient outcomes in tympanoplasty procedures.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Kaur et al.

N2  - Techniques and biomaterials for reconstructive middle ear surgery are continuously and steadily developing. At the same time, clinical post-surgery results are evaluated to determine success or failure of the therapy. Routine quality assessment and assurance is of growing importance in the medical field, and therefore also in middle ear surgery. The exact definition and acquisition of outcome parameters is essential for both a comprehensive and detailed quality assurance. These parameters are not the audiological results alone, but also additional individual parameters, which influence the postoperative outcome after tympanoplasty. Selection of patients and the preoperative clinical situation, the extent of the ossicular chain destruction, the chosen reconstruction technique and material, the audiometric frequency selection and the observational interval are only some of them. If these parameters are not well documented, the value of comparative analyses between different studies is very limited. The present overview aims at describing, comparing, and evaluating some of the existing assessment and scoring systems for middle ear surgery. Additionally, new methods for an intraoperative quality assessment in ossiculoplasty and the postoperative evaluation of suboptimal hearing results with imaging techniques are available. In the area of implant development, functional elements were integrated in prostheses to enable not only good sound transmission but also compensation of occurring atmospheric pressure changes. In combination with other components for ossicular repair, they can be used in a modular manner, which so far show experimentally and clinically promising results.

N2  - Far-advanced otosclerosis (FAO) refers to severe otosclerosis with scarce auditory functions. The identification of the best method to correctly listen to sound and speech has a large impact on patients' quality of life. We retrospectively analyzed the auditory function of 15 patients affected by FAO who were treated with stapedectomy plus hearing aids independent of the severity of their auditory deficit before surgery. The combination of surgery and hearing aids allowed excellent recovery of the perception of pure tone sounds and speech. Four patients, because of poor auditory thresholds, needed a cochlear implant after stapedectomy. Despite being based on a small sample of patients, our results suggest that stapedotomy plus hearing aids could improve the auditory capacities of patients with FAO independent of their auditory thresholds at T0. The careful selection of patients is fundamental to obtain the best outcomes.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective</ovid:b>: To reveal the factors affecting the incidence of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) transection during middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>Study Design</ovid:b>: Retrospective case review., <ovid:b>Setting</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>Patients</ovid:b>: We analyzed 232 ears (117 ears with cholesteatoma, 101 ears with chronic otitis media, and 14 ears with otosclerosis) that underwent tympanoplasty or stapes surgery during 2017-2020., <ovid:b>Intervention</ovid:b>: Eighty-four ears underwent transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES), 103 ears underwent microscopic ear surgery (MES), and 45 ears underwent surgery using both endoscopy and microscopy (Dual)., <ovid:b>Main Outcome Measure</ovid:b>: To confirm CTN transection, intraoperative endoscopic/microscopic video images were evaluated. We used the same video images to determine the anatomical variation of the CTN course in the middle ear., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: In 18 ears (7.8%: 6/84 TEES ears [7.1%], 6/103 MES ears [5.8%], and 6/45 Dual ears [13.3%]), the CTN was cut during middle ear surgery. There was no significant difference in CTN transection among groups. In cholesteatoma patients, stapes involvement resulted in a significantly higher CTN transection incidence. CTN anatomical variants such as the "Attached Short type" and "Ultrashort type" showed a significantly higher CTN transection incidence., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: Although endoscopic surgery did not reduce the incidence of CTN transection during middle ear surgery, pathological involvement of the stapes and CTN anatomical variants, such as the "Attached Short type" and "Ultrashort type," may increase this incidence. Preoperative evaluation of stapes involvement and anatomical location of the CTN course could help identify patients at greater risk for iatrogenic CTN transection., <ovid:b>Level of Evidence</ovid:b>: 4.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Authors.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objectives</ovid:b>: Chorda tympani nerve (CTN) function may be damaged more by two-stage than by one-stage surgery for middle ear cholesteatoma. However, few studies have reported the relationship between two-stage cholesteatoma surgery and CTN function. This study aimed to investigate CTN function after two-stage surgery for cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: In this prospective study, 35 patients underwent two-stage canal wall up tympanoplasty (CWUT). Perioperative CTN function was assessed using questionnaires and electrogustometry (EGM). Participants were categorized into minor, major, and section groups, based on the degree of CTN manipulation during surgery., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: In the first-stage surgery, posterior tympanotomy with an intact canal wall reduced the degree of CTN manipulation. The incidence of taste disorder after the first-stage surgery was 71.4%. Postoperative taste disorder and the EGM threshold improved early in the minor manipulation group. In the second-stage surgery, no new CTN damage occurred, even if this surgery involved removal of residual cholesteatoma. The incidence of taste disorder after second-stage surgery was less than that after first-stage surgery, independent of CTN preservation. However, the recovery rate of the EGM threshold after second-stage surgery was significantly lower in the section group than in those with CTN preservation., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: CTN function, including symptoms and EGM threshold, can be preserved during two-stage cholesteatoma surgery if care is taken to preserve the CTN in both the first- and second-stage surgeries. A two-stage CWUT, ensuring an intact bony annulus, may be effective to facilitate CTN preservation., <ovid:b>Level of Evidence</ovid:b>: 2b.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Authors.

N2  - <ovid:b>Background</ovid:b>: Research on the factors affecting the functional outcome of tympanoplasty in chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is limited. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic factors of hearing outcome in CSOM patients following tympanoplasty. The multivariate logistic regression analysis is used to evaluate the influence of demographic, audiological, clinical and disease factors on the postoperative prognosis of CSOM., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: A total of 179 CSOM patients who received surgery between January 2016 and December 2019 were retrospectively included. The inclusion criteria are mainly based on clinical classification of otitis media and surgical classification guidelines [2012]. These patients were divided into an effective group (n=132) and a non-effective group (n=47) according to their postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) value. Multivariate analysis was performed according to the pure tone hearing results 1 week before operation and 4 weeks after operation., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: The type of preoperative hearing impairment, middle ear cholesteatoma, ossicular chain status, tympanic perforation site, repair material, tympanum sclerosis, and surgical methods were significantly different between the effective and non-effective groups (all P<0.01). The speech reception threshold (SRT) (36.88+/-15.54 <ovid:i>vs.</ovid:i> 27.68+/-13.75, P<0.001) and ABG (18.53+/-9.30 <ovid:i>vs.</ovid:i> 10.89+/-5.07, P<0.001) values were markedly reduced after surgery in the effective group but not in the non-effective group. Furthermore, the postoperative decreases in the SRT (9.20+/-9.69 <ovid:i>vs.</ovid:i> 2.021+/-7.34, P<0.001) and ABG (7.64+/-8.57 <ovid:i>vs.</ovid:i> 0.45+/-7.322, P<0.001) values were considerably higher in the effective group than the non-effective group. After multivariate logistic regression analysis, we found that the type of preoperative hearing impairment [P=0.031; odds ratio (OR) =2.378], ossicular chain status (P=0.002; OR =4.430)., <ovid:b>Conclusions</ovid:b>: Our research shows that the curative effect of conductive deafness before operation is 2.378 times better than that of mixed deafness, the curative effect of complete and unfixed ossicular chain before operation is 1.080 times better than that of interrupted ossicular chain, and the curative effect of complete ossicular chain but fixed ossicular chain is 4.430 times better than that of interrupted ossicular chain. Our findings may help to predict the postoperative prognosis of patients, thus facilitating the development of corresponding treatment strategies.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright 2022 Annals of Translational Medicine.

N2  - Temporalis fascia is being used as graft material for tympanic membrane repair for over six decades. Though cartilage with or without perichondrium is also being used for different situations, still temporalis fascia graft is being considered as an ideal graft for tympanoplasty. Earlier the dried temporalis fascia was used as a graft but now freshly taken wet temporalis fascia is increasingly being used as a more 'physiological/ live' graft. The present study was planned to compare the results of use of wet and dry temporalis fascia in chronic otitis media mucosal disease. The prospective study was conducted on 100 patients of chronic suppurative otitis media mucosal disease. Chronic ear survey questionnaire were filled to note the impact on quality of life. Otoscopic, oto-endoscopic and examination under microscope performed. Patients were allocated into two groups alternately. Freshly taken wet temporalis graft was used in group I whereas dry temporalis fascia was used in group II. Hearing evaluation by pure tone audiogram was done preoperatively and at 6th months post-operatively. Pre-operative and post-operative hearings in both the groups were compared. Air bone gap closures after surgery in between both the groups were compared to see for any statistical difference. We found similar graft uptake in both the groups after 6 months of surgery. The air bone gap closure in group I was 10.80 +/- 5.74 and group II was 9.28 +/- 4.81, there was no significant difference. However senior authors noted that in some of the cases in group I with fresh wet graft placement neo-tympanum formation was noticed early showing good circumferential leash of blood vessels all around signifying early vascularisation.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2020.

N2  - <ovid:b>Background</ovid:b>: The rise in the use of prescription opioids for postoperative analgesia within surgery has mirrored an increased trend of opioid-related morbidity within Canada and the United States. This study prospectively studied daily pain levels and medication requirements postoperatively in patients undergoing elective Otolaryngology-Head and Neck surgery procedures., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: Patients were asked to prospectively document their pain level and medication use daily for 7 days postoperatively. A final survey was used to quantify unused medication left at home and clarify each patient's disposal plan. We included patients undergoing elective outpatient or short stay surgeries from three tertiary care centers in Toronto, Ontario from September 2016 to September 2017. Previous opioids users or patients suffering from chronic pain were excluded., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: A final cohort of 56 eligible adult patients were included in the study. The most common procedures were thyroidectomy (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 19), endoscopic sinus surgery (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 10), tympanoplasty/ossiculoplasty (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 7), and cochlear implant (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 5). Most patients received a prescription for acetaminophen/codeine (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 29, 51.8%) or acetaminophen/oxycodone (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 22, 39.3%) and used on average 29% of their initial prescription. Patients most commonly opted to keep their unused narcotics at home (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 23, 41%). A total of 710 tablets of narcotics were overprescribed in our study population, 351 of which were kept in patients' home for future use., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: There is a clear tendency to overestimate postoperative pain resulting in significant overprescription of opioids among Otolaryngologists.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Authors.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective</ovid:b>: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are patient-centered, evidence-based pathways designed to reduce complications, promote recovery, and improve outcomes following surgery. These protocols have been successfully applied for the management of head and neck cancer, but relatively few studies have investigated the applicability of these pathways for other outpatient procedures in otolaryngology. Our goal was to perform a systematic review of available evidence reporting the utility of ERAS protocols for the management of patients undergoing outpatient otolaryngology operations., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: A systematic literature review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and gray literature. We identified studies that evaluated ERAS protocols among patients undergoing otologic, laryngeal, nasal/sinus, pediatric, and general otolaryngology operations. We assessed the outcomes and ERAS components across protocols as well as the study design and limitations., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: A total of eight studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. Types of procedures evaluated with ERAS protocols included tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy, functional endoscopic sinus surgery, tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy, and septoplasty. A reduction in postoperative length of stay and hospital costs was reported in two and three studies, respectively. Comparative studies between ERAS and control groups showed persistent improvement in pre- and postoperative anxiety and pain levels, without an increase in postoperative complications and readmission rates., <ovid:b>Conclusions</ovid:b>: A limited number of studies discuss implementation of ERAS protocols for outpatient operations in otolaryngology. These clinical pathways appear promising for these procedures as they may reduce length of stay, decrease costs, and improve pain and anxiety postoperatively.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Authors.

N2  - The intricate distribution of the facial nerve within the temporal bone is crucial in otological surgery. Anomalous facial nerve pathways are occasionally observed in middle ear malformations, although intra-tympanic bifurcation of the facial nerve is rare. When managing ossicular malformations with atypical facial nerve trajectories, hearing reconstruction should be prioritized based on the trajectory pattern and presence of the oval window. In this case, stapes surgery was performed due to facial nerve bifurcation within the tympanic cavity. In this case report, a 15-year-old female underwent stapes surgery due to gradually worsening conductive hearing loss. She was monitored at another hospital because of left-sided hearing loss at birth screening using automated auditory brainstem response. Her left ear initially had mild hearing loss, while her right ear remained within normal limits. However, her hearing deteriorated progressively, leading to significant daily challenges by age seven, prompting referral to our hospital. Intraoperatively, findings included defects in the incus-long process and stapes head, along with facial nerve bifurcation around the oval window, and the stapes footplate had poor flexibility. Stapedotomy was performed cautiously to preserve the facial nerve, utilizing a Teflon piston wire for sound transmission reconstruction. Postoperatively, the patient experienced no complications or facial nerve palsy, with hearing improving to 28.8 dB. Understanding the precise pathophysiology of middle ear anomalies is crucial for selecting appropriate surgical approaches. Even though the anomalies could not be evaluated prior to surgery, surgeons must carefully consider the risk of facial nerve injury and choose the optimal technique and reconstruction method tailored to each case, as predicting outcomes solely from preoperative evaluations can be challenging.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Miura et al.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Iatrogenic injury of the chorda tympani nerve (CTN) is a well-recognized complication of middle ear surgery The aim of the present study was to compare CTN injury occurring as a result of type 1 tympanoplasty performed using microscopic and endoscopic methods., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective study was conducted at our institution on patients diagnosed with chronic otitis and then treated with type 1 tympanoplasty surgery between January, 2013 and January, 2014 . The patients were divided into two groups; group 1 consisted of patients who underwent endoscopic tympanoplasty and group 2 consisted of patients who underwent microscopic tympanoplasty. At follow-up 3, 6 ,and 12 months after surgery patients were asked to complete a questionnaire that enquired about symptoms of CTN injury: changes in taste sensation, tongue numbness. and dry mouth., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There were 66 patients (33 males, mean age 30.4 +/- 8.14 years (range: 8-56 years)) There were 25 patients in group I (endoscopic tympanoplasty) and 41 patients in group 2 (miscroscopic tympanoplasty). A total of 11 (16.6%) patients reported symptoms related to CTN damage: 1 (4%) patient in group and 10 (24%) patients in group 2. A metallic taste in the mouth was the most-common symptom, noted by 7 patients(63.6%), 1 (4%) in group 1 and 6(14.6%) in group 2. Ageusia/hypogeusia was reported by 4 patients (37.4%) all in group 2 Tongue numbness occurred in 2 patients (4.8%) in group 2. No patients had xerostomia., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Type I tympanoplasty performed with an endoscopic technique is minimally invasive,and is associated with less CTN manipulation and as a consequence less iatrogenic injury to the CTN.

N2  - Background: Tympanoplasty, essential for repairing tympanic membrane perforations, requires careful postoperative care for successful recovery. However, timely access to healthcare guidance can be challenging, especially in rural or underserved areas. ChatGPT-4, an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, offers a potential solution for continuous postoperative support and patient education. This study assesses the feasibility and effectiveness of using ChatGPT-4 as a supplementary information resource for tympanoplasty patients, focusing on its ability to provide accurate, precise, and relevant postoperative guidance in situations where access to healthcare professionals is limited. <ovid:br/>Methods: Ten commonly asked postoperative questions related to tympanoplasty were posed to ChatGPT-4, including queries on infection signs, activity restrictions, and wound care. Ten medical professionals evaluated the responses based on accuracy, response time, clarity, and relevance. <ovid:br/>Results: ChatGPT-4 provided responses that aligned well with current medical guidelines, achieving an accuracy rating between 80% and 100% across different questions. Response time was consistently fast, with 100% of responses delivered immediately. Clarity and relevance ratings were also high, with 90% or more responses rated as easy to understand and directly addressing patient concerns. Conclusion : ChatGPT-4 shows considerable promise as an adjunctive tool in postoperative tympanoplasty care, offering timely, understandable information that supports patients following aftercare instructions. While not a replacement for professional medical advice, ChatGPT-4's capability to deliver accurate and relevant information enhances accessibility to postoperative guidance, particularly in remote or resourcelimited settings, underscoring AI's growing role in otolaryngology patient support.

N2  - Background: The aim of the study is to evaluate the incidence of recurrence of acquired cholesteatoma and functional outcomes in patients who underwent CWD tympanoplasty with cavity obliteration using an inferior-based musculoperiosteal flap. A comparison between children and adults was conducted. <ovid:br/>Methods: All surgeries performed by the same expert surgeon from 2016 to 2019 were considered for the study. Patients younger than 18 years old, operated on at Meyer's Children Hospital, formed group A. Patients older than eighteen, operated on at Santo Stefano Hospital, formed group B. Clinical, audiological, and radiological data were collected from medical records. The Air Bone Gap (ABG) was used to assess the audiological results, and outpatient evaluations were considered to detect cases of recurrence. <ovid:br/>Results: Group A and Group B are composed of 23 and 25 patients, respectively. The postoperative ABG is 30.7 dBHL in group A and 29.5 dBHL in group B. The rate of recurrence is 17.2% in children and 8% in adults. The recurrence of cholesteatoma occurred in five children (21.8%) after an average follow-up of 18 months and in three adults (12%) after an average follow-up of 24 months. Conclusion : The surgical approach to CCOM in children aims to be as conservative as possible. The greater extension of the pathology is correlated with a greater erosion of the ossicular chain. According to our experience, open tympanoplasty with the obliterative technique allows us to obtain good anatomical and audiological outcomes, both in adults and children.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To investigate the short-term efficacy of third-generation bisphosphonate in the management of tinnitus associated with otosclerosis., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A prospective case-control study included 100 patients with otosclerosis-associated bothersome tinnitus. Patients were assigned to two groups: group A (control): 25 patients who planned to receive only complementary supplements, oral vitamin D plus calcium, and group B (case): 75 patients who planned to receive oral bisphosphonate plus routine vitamin D and calcium supplements. Group B was subdivided into B<ovid:sub>1</ovid:sub>: 25 patients without any previous intervention, B<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub>: 25 patients with persistent tinnitus for more than 6 months after a previous uncomplicated stapedotomy in the same ear, and B<ovid:sub>3</ovid:sub>: 25 patients with persistent tinnitus for more than 6 months after hearing aid fitting. The outcome was tinnitus assessment both subjectively (tinnitus intensity, frequency, and questionnaire) and objectively (tinnitus intensity and frequency)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The female-to-male ratio was 1.6:1 with ages ranging from 40 to 61 years. The baseline revealed no statistically significant differences between the groups. After 6 months, there were statistically significant differences, both objectively and subjectively. The tinnitus questionnaire median (IQR) for group B was 16 (30), whereas control group A had 52 (24). The tinnitus severity median (IQR) for group B was 20 (30), compared to group A's 52 (42). After 6 months, 40% of the cases in group B demonstrated complete improvement, compared to 0% in control group A., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: We demonstrated significant tinnitus improvement in cases treated with bisphosphonate compared to the control group.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Some preoperative and postoperative audiological outcomes may be associated with quality of life (QoL) in stapedotomy patients., <ovid:b>AIMS</ovid:b>: The aim of this study is to determine which frequencies and conduction pathways improve following this surgery and to assess their effects on QoL., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Cases who underwent small fenestra stapedotomy were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative and postoperative pure tone audiometry were evaluated. The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) questionnaire was also administered to assess the impact of the operation on their QoL. The relationship between audiologic results and QoL was also examined., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 45 ears from 41 patients were included in the study. There is a statistically significant improvement in postoperative mean air conduction (AC), bone conduction (BC) and air-bone gap (ABG) values compared to preoperative values (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .001). A significant moderate correlation was found between preoperative mean ABG and GBI scores, and between postoperative improvements in AC thresholds and ABG at all frequencies (500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz) and GBI scores (0.3<<ovid:i>r</ovid:i> < 0.7, <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .05). Among the postoperative BC thresholds, only the improvement at 2,000 Hz was found to have an effect on the GBI score (<ovid:i>r</ovid:i> = .309, <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = .049)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE</ovid:b>: Audiological outcomes following stapedotomy had an impact on QoL. Preoperative ABG can be used as an indicator of postoperative QOL.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Revision stapes surgery is a challenging procedure performed in relatively small numbers compared to other middle ear procedures. Despite numerous data on hearing results of different middle ear surgeries, the audiological standards for successful outcome of this procedure are still not clarified. On the basis of well-documented data, we wanted to determine what the expected audiological results and complications are after revision stapes surgery in order to set a realistic threshold for surgical success., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: After the protocol registration in the PROSPERO database, a systematic review was performed in multiple databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceOpen, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar) according to PRISMA guidelines. Twelve articles were reviewed according to the inclusion criteria. A total of 1032 cases were obtained for evaluation. A modified version of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess publication quality., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Average air-bone gap (ABG) gain was 17.3 dB, average air conduction (AC) gain was 17.5 dB. The average postoperative air-bone gap was 11.1 dB. The postoperative ABG distribution was the following 0-10 dB: 53.3%, > 10-20 dB: 28.2%, > 20 dB: 18.5%. SNHL as a surgical complication was described in a total of 17 cases (1.6%), no equilibrium disorder was reported., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The pooled data suggest that revision stapes surgery is an effective solution after failure of previous stapes surgery. However, the results are clearly inferior to those of primary stapedotomies. Hence, we need to apply different expectations and use different standards in the indication and evaluation of this type of surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The introduction of endoscopy into middle ear has open up new opportunities for minimal invasive temporal bone surgery. The present study was planned to compare anatomical and functional outcome in patients who underwent endoscope assisted tympanoplasty using cartilage and temporalis fascia graft., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The present prospective observational randomized study was carried out in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of a tertiary care teaching hospital of Rajasthan, India from September 2020 to July 2021. Fifty patients of age group 18-60 years, with diagnosis of chronic otitis media having inactive mucosal disease were enrolled in the study and divided into two groups viz. cartilage (group I) and temporalis fascia group (group II). Each patient postoperatively underwent otoscopic examination of ear and pure tone audiometery at 8 weeks and 3rd month. Local wound condition, graft uptake and healing and hearing were assessed and compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Graft uptake was 92% in cartilage group and 84% in temporalis fascia group. Air conduction and air-bone gap of patients in both the groups showed significant improvement after 3 months of surgery. (p<0.05) Regarding bone conduction, both groups had shown non-significant changes. (p > 0.05) Hearing gain was comparable on both groups which was 6.71dB in cartilage group vs. 5.9 dB in other group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The present study showed that graft placement time for temporalis fascia graft was less than cartilage graft, but the difference was insignificant. Hearing improvement, graft uptake and clinical improvement were found to be statistically insignificant between both groups.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - Middle ear neuroendocrine tumors (MeNETs) are an exceptionally rare occurrence. These benign tumors stem from the tympanic mucosa and can easily be misinterpreted by the clinician and the pathologist. Clinical characteristics, otoscopic findings and medical imaging in these cases are non-specific. We present a case of a 60-year-old male patient with bilateral hearing loss following recent coronavirus disease 2019 disease. Diagnostic work-up revealed a soft tissue neoplasm of the left middle ear. Surgical resection of the tumor mass with implantation of a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) was the main modality of treatment. Middle ear neuroendocrine tumors was confirmed through positive immunohistochemistry for neuroendocrine tumor markers. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging 12 months after the surgery reported no tumor recurrence or significant residual disease with a stable PORP. Our report highlights challenges in diagnosing and treating these rare tumors, while emphasizing surgical resection pitfalls and resulting improvement of quality of life of the patient. We recommend a through followup of patients with unclear soft tissue masses in the middle ear to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Atelectasis otitis media (AtOM) is a chronic condition where the tympanic membrane (TM) becomes retracted towards the middle ear and the ossicular chain. Surgical treatment for this condition could be indicated based on stage of atelectasis, patient's clinical condition and hearing loss. Over the years, AtOM has been treated with various types of tympanoplasty under microscopic view. The aim of this study is to present the results of endoscopic ear surgery in AtOM., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Forty-five patients who underwent endoscopic trans-canal tympanoplasty were included in the study. Preoperative features, intraoperative findings and postoperative outcomes were collected., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Preoperatively, none of the study's patients were classified with a Sade Grade I, whereas grades II, III and IV were 3 (6.6%), 23 (32.1%) and 19 (67.8%) respectively. The 3 patients with Sade grade II showed a conductive hearing loss higher than 20 dB and a continuous ear fullness, therefore they were surgically treated. The postoperative graft success rate was estimated at 95.5%. During follow-up, 2 patients showed a TM perforation (at 6 and 12 months after surgery) whereas 1 patient experienced a recurrence of atelectasis in the TM (16 months after surgery). The overall success rate at the final follow-up was calculated at 88.8%. The average preoperative air-conduction threshold was 51.1 +/- 21.5, which reduced to 34.6 +/- 22.1 (p = 0.04) at follow-up. The preoperative air-bone gap decreased from 28 +/- 7.2 to 11.8 +/- 10 (p = 0.002) after surgery., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Atelectasis otitis media might be suitable for exclusive endoscopic surgical treatment, as it appears to exhibit a low recurrence rate and promising audiological outcomes.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Lateral skull base (LSB) and middle ear pathologies often involve the facial nerve (FN), and their treatment may require FN sacrifice. Cases with unidentifiable proximal stump or intact FN with complete FN palsy, necessitate FN anastomosis with another motor nerve in order to restore innervation to the mimicking musculature. The results of hypoglossal-to-facial nerve anastomosis (HFA) and masseteric-facial nerve anastomosis in patients with facial paralysis after middle ear and LSB surgeries, are presented and compared., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Adult patients with total definitive facial paralysis after middle ear or LSB surgery undergoing facial nerve reanimation through hypoglossal or masseteric transfer anastomosis were enrolled. The facial nerve function was graded according to the House Brackmann grading system (HB). The facial function results at 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18 months and at the last follow up (more than 18 months) are compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 153 cases of LSB and middle ear surgery presented postoperative facial palsy and underwent facial nerve reanimation surgery with HF in 85 patients (55.5%) and MF in 68 patients (44.5%). The duration of the FN palsy before reconstructive surgery was inversely associated to better FN results, in particular with having a grade III HB (p = 0.003). Both techniques had significantly lower HB scores when an interval between palsy onset and reanimation surgery was 6 months or less (MF p = 0.0401; HF p = 0.0022). Patients who underwent a MF presented significant improvement of the FN function at 3 months from surgery (p = 0.0078). At the last follow-up, 63.6% recovered to a grade III HB and 22.7% to a grade IV. On the other hand, the first significant results obtained in the HF group were at 6 months from surgery (p < 0.0001). 67.8% of patients had a grade III HB after a HF at the last follow-up, 28.8% a grade IV. FN grading at 6 months from surgery was significantly lower in the MF group compared to the HF (p = 0.0351). The two techniques had statistically similar results at later follow-up evaluations., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION/CONCLUTION</ovid:b>: MF was associated to initial superior results, presenting significant facial recovery at 3 months, and significantly better functional outcomes at 6 months from surgery compared to HF. Although later results were not significantly different in this study, earlier results have an important role in order to limit the duration of risk of corneal exposure.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Otosclerosis leads to a fixed stapes footplate and thus to hearing loss. The predominant treatment method is surgery, with various types of stapes prostheses available. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the new mAXIS Stapes Prosthesis., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: 34 cases of otosclerosis were implanted with the new mAXIS Stapes Prosthesis. Comprehensive clinical assessments, including pre- and postoperative pure tone audiometry was performed at short-term (ST) follow-up at 25 (+/- 15) days and mid-term (MT) follow-up at 181 (+/- 107) days. The pure tone average of 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz (PTA4) was calculated., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In all cases, the application of the prosthesis was successful and straightforward. The postoperative PTA4 air-bone gap was 10.7 +/- 5.2 dB at ST follow-up (n = 34) and 8.3 +/- 4.1 dB at MT follow-up (n = 18). In 61% of cases, the ABG-closure was within 10 dB and in 100% of cases within 20 dB at MT follow-up., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Findings of this study support that the mAXIS Stapes Prosthesis is safe for implantation and shows promising audiological outcome. Future investigations will contribute its long-term efficacy and safety profile.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Aim: To improve the effectiveness of surgical treatment for patients with post-traumatic tympanic membrane perforations and concurrent Eustachian tube dysfunction through simultaneous combined surgical methods., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Materials and Methods: We analyzed clinical and functional outcomes of 35 patients (mean age: 34 +/- 10,5 years) with tympanic membrane perforations caused by acoustic and blast injuries. The patients were divided into two groups: the first group (n=17) underwent only tympanoplasty type 1, while the second group (n=18) underwent simultaneous septoplasty, inferior turbinectomy, and tympanoplasty with prolonged middle ear ventilation using a subanular Silverstein tube. Parameters analyzed included time from injury to surgery, perforation size and localization, and audiometric results., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Results: Both groups demonstrated significant hearing improvement, with a reduction in the air-bone gap. The results demonstrate the clinical and functional effectiveness of both simultaneous combined surgical treatment (septoplasty, inferior turbinectomy, and tympanoplasty) and isolated tympanoplasty in military patients with tympanic membrane perforations due to blast wave trauma, acoustic barotrauma, and explosion injuries. After treatment, the findings show significantly reduced bone-air gaps and improved air-conducted sound perception thresholds., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Conclusions: Simultaneous septoplasty, inferior turbinectomy, and tympanoplasty offer a modern and effective approach to treating patients with post-traumatic tympanic membrane perforations and Eustachian tube dysfunction. Early intervention is particularly critical for military patients exposed to blast injuries to ensure faster recovery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate taste disorders after middle ear surgery, their modifying factors especially chorda tympani nerve injury or underlying otologic disease. We investigated consequences of taste disorders on quality of life., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective cohort study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Monocentric study in tertiary care center., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A total of 214 patients who underwent middle ear surgery were included. Data regarding taste disorders were collected by questionnaires over a 1-year follow-up period., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Taste disorders were reported in 42.7% at 10 days, in 23.3% at 4 months, and in 9.2% 1 year postoperatively. When the chorda tympani nerve was initially healthy, taste disorders were more frequent after its transection throughout the follow-up period. When it was involved in a cholesteatoma or inflammatory process, postoperative taste disorders were more frequent after nerve stretching. Postoperative discomfort in daily life was rated on the Likert scale at 3.5 out of 10. Dietary modifications were reported by 25.8% of patients, and mood alterations by 15% of patients., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Taste disorders are frequent after middle ear surgery although they mostly improve in the first months. When the CTN is healthy, cutting it leads to more taste disorders than stretching it, thus advocating its preservation to prevent these symptoms. However, in cases of pathological CTN, cutting this nerve, which is sometimes necessary to control the disease, is less likely to cause taste disorders than stretching it. These taste disorders are a source of discomfort and may present risks of dietary modifications and emotional impact.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Investigate whether nonopioid analgesics (NOA) provide adequate pain control after otologic surgery., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective multicenter cohort., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Two quaternary academic medical centers., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Patients over 12 years old who underwent otologic surgery involving the middle ear and/or mastoid at two centers over a 5-month period., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Patients were prescribed acetaminophen and ibuprofen postoperatively and instructed to contact the surgical team if pain control was inadequate, in which case an opioid medication was prescribed. Level of pain and medication use were assessed with a standardized questionnaire, 1 week after surgery., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Postoperative pain levels during the first week after surgery (0-10); proportion of patients requiring opioid medication., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixty-seven patients were included. Of these, 37% underwent tympanomastoidectomy, 27% cochlear implant, 19.5% postauricular tympanoplasty, 10.5% transcanal tympanoplasty, and 6% had a different surgery. The median of the average level of pain in the first 7 days was 5/10 (IQR 3-6). The median highest level of pain was 5 (IQR 4-8). The median current level of pain was 3 (IQR 1-5). Seven patients (10%) required breakthrough opioid pain medication. The remaining 90% utilized NOA only. One week after surgery, 60% were taking nonopioid analgesics only while the remaining 40% were not taking any pain medication at all. Although opioids were required infrequently, there were no significant differences in medication use between the two centers., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: NOA provide adequate pain control for most patients after middle ear and mastoid otologic surgery. Opioid analgesics do not routinely need to be prescribed.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The primary objective of this study was to analyse middle ear structures critical for cochlear implantation using computed tomography., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Patients who underwent cochlear implantation at the Department of Otolaryngology in Szczecin between 2015 and 2022 were eligible for the study. We analysed computed tomography images of 57 ears in 52 patients. The following parameters were assessed: mastoid aeration, tegmen tympani height, sigmoid sinus position, posterior tympanotomy width, the distance between the facial nerve and chorda tympani, modified facial recess distance, and the prediction line described by other authors., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In 69% of patients, after the removal of the round window bony overhang, the round window membrane became fully visible. There were no statistically significant correlations found for parameters describing mastoid process anatomy or those rating the width of the posterior tympanotomy concerning round window access. The prediction lines, according to Kashio and Jwair, were found to be relevant. In cases where patients' access to the niche and membrane of the window was rated as good or very good during clinical evaluation, they were more likely to describe the window as being located posteriorly or medially in the radiological evaluation. Using a binary Jwair scale provided a better correlation with the clinical assessment. In cases where the windows were graded as posterior, the clinical assessment indicated better surgical access, especially to the RWM (Round Window Membrane)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Evaluating middle ear anatomy on a computed tomography scan is useful for preparing for middle ear surgery but does not significantly affect the ability to access the round window. For such access, the position of the window in relation to the facial nerve is the most relevant factor, and measurements based on this relationship hold the highest clinical value.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The aim of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of PRF-augmented fascia tympanoplasty versus cartilage tympanoplasty in repair of large TM perforations., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This randomized clinical trial included 156 patients with dry large tympanic membrane perforations. Patients were randomly allocated into 2 groups, cartilage tympanoplasty group (n = 77) and platelet rich fibrin (PRF) augmented tympanoplasty group (n = 79). Graft take rates, hearing outcomes, operative time, and postoperative complications were documented and compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Graft take rate was 96.1% in the cartilage group and 93.7% PRF group with no statistically significant difference. Operative time was significantly longer in the cartilage group. No differences in the hearing outcomes and postoperative complications were reported., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Application of PRF on the fascia in tympanoplasty promotes healing of the tympanic membrane. PRF is safe, cheap, readily available, and easily prepared and applied. It increases the success rates of large tympanic membrane perforations without the need for cartilage grafts.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This study aimed to establish the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and assess the responsiveness of the Chinese version of Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21-Chn)., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective multicenter study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Four Chinese tertiary referral centers admitting patients nationwide., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: 230 adult patients with chronic otitis media (COM) undergoing tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Patients were required to complete the ZCMEI-21-Chn to measure health-related quality of life both preoperatively and postoperatively. An anchor-based method was used to determine the MCID of the derivative cohort by including the Global Rating of Change Questionnaire as an anchor. The generalizability and consistency with functional outcomes of the MCID estimates were externally examined in a validation cohort using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 161 and 69 patients were included in the derivative and validation cohort. The mean preoperative and postoperative ZCMEI-21-Chn total scores were 28.4 (standard deviation [SD] 14.5) and 17.5 (SD 12.6). The mean change in ZCMEI-21-Chn score was 10.9 (SD 14.3, p < 0.001). The MCIDs of the ZCMEI-21-Chn for improvement and deterioration were estimated at 13 (SD 13.0) and -7 (SD 12.9), accordingly. For patients who have reported an improved health-related quality of life, a cutoff value of 15.6 dB HL for elevation of the air-conducted hearing threshold was noticed. However, change of clinical importance judged according to MCID and Japan Otological Society criteria disagreed with each other, notably with a Cohen's kappa ( kappa ) of 0.14 ( p = 0.21) in the validation cohort., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study is the first to establish the MCID of a COM-specific questionnaire in Chinese. For the COM population undergoing surgical intervention, MCID values of 13 for improvement and -7 for deterioration are recommended. The results were externally validated to be generalizable to nationwide usage, yet distinguishable from the audiological criteria. The availability of the MCID greatly adds to the clinical utility of the ZCMEI-21-Chn by enabling a clinically meaningful interpretation of its score changes.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - Current therapeutic options for hearing loss rely on hearing aids, ossiculoplasty or cochlear implants. These devices have limitations, particularly in noisy acoustic environments. Therefore, interest in exploring aetiological treatments to improve not only auditory perception but also the quality of life of those affected is increasing. Gene therapy is a promising aetiological treatment that can fully restore auditory function. The success of gene therapy relies on the efficient delivery of therapeutic genes or genetic modifications to the cells of the inner ear that are designed to repair or replace defective genes and restore normal hearing function. Two main strategies for gene therapy involve the use of recombinant viral vectors and nonviral delivery vehicles. Owing to their excellent diffusion properties and compatibility with sensory cells, recombinant viral vectors, particularly adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), have dominated gene therapy in the cochlea. However, recombinant viral vectors have several drawbacks, such as limited transgene size, immunogenicity (particularly in neonates), and potential need for repeat administration. Nonviral vectors, such as cationic lipids and polymeric nanoparticles, are potential attractive alternatives. Nonviral vectors have several advantages, including low immunogenicity and unlimited transgene size. Recent studies have demonstrated significant auditory recovery in vivo using nonviral vectors in murine models. However, nonviral vectors are not as efficient as viral vectors in transferring genetic material. An alternative to nanoparticles is the use of other methods, such as electroporation. The main advantage of electroporation is that it can be used in combination with cochlear implantation and can target surface cells, but this method has a risk of cell damage. The goal of this review is to provide valuable insights into the current state of research on nonviral vectors for inner ear gene therapy and propose the exploration of innovative and effective gene therapy strategies for the treatment of hearing loss.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: This study aimed to conduct a comparative analysis of audiological and postoperative clinical outcomes between the endoscopic and microscopic stapedotomy approaches., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This study employed a randomized, controlled design. Twenty-seven patients with bilateral otosclerosis underwent stapedotomy in both ears, with randomized allocation of the surgical technique (endoscopic vs. microscopic) for the first operated ear. Air-bone gap (ABG) and ABG gain were measured at least 12 months postoperatively. Postoperative outcomes including pain (Visual Analog Scale-VAS), dizziness, early-term (day 1) and late-term (6 months) dysgeusia were evaluated. The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) assessed health-related quality of life at one month postoperatively, and operative time was measured., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: This study compared endoscopic (n = 27 ears) and microscopic (n = 27 ears) stapedotomy for otosclerosis. Both groups achieved similar hearing improvement with no significant differences in pre-operative and post-operative bone/air conduction thresholds, ABG, and ABG gain (all p > 0.05). The endoscopic stapedotomy group demonstrated reduced postoperative pain (lower VAS scores, p < 0.001), lower early dysgeusia (3.7% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.005), shorter operative time (47.3 vs. 75.4 min, p < 0.001) and improved patient-reported outcomes (higher GBI score, p = 0.014) when compared to microscopic stapedotomy group. No significant differences were observed in postoperative dizziness or late-term dysgeusia between groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study found similar hearing improvement with both endoscopic and microscopic stapedotomy for otosclerosis. However, the endoscopic approach showed advantages in reduced postoperative pain, early dysgeusia, and operative time, with improved patient-reported quality of life. These findings suggest endoscopic stapedotomy as a valuable alternative to the conventional microscopic approach.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The purpose of this study is to analyse the effect of half canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy in the treatment of chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: In this retrospective study, the half canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy technique was used at our hospital for chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma removal in 265 adult patients, representing 271 operated ears, with an average follow-up time of 8.4 years., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The post-operative cavities were slightly wider and straighter in 91.9 per cent of the ears. Fifteen per cent of the patients needed cavity cleaning every six months, 25 per cent of them needed cavity cleaning every year and 60 per cent of the patients had a self-cleaning cavity. Only one patient with a cleft palate experienced cholesteatoma recurrence in the mesotympanum., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The half canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy technique showed a low-recurrence rate and satisfying operative cavities. The half canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy technique is a good choice for middle ear surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: We present the initial outcomes of transoral robotic parathyroidectomy (TORP) using the transoral vestibular approach in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT)., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: A retrospective case series analysis was performed on patients diagnosed with PHPT between October 2016 and July 2019 who underwent transoral robotic surgery for parathyroidectomy., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Thirteen patients (five males and eight females) successfully underwent TORP at our institution from October 2016 to July 2019. Eight patients underwent TORP alone, and five underwent TORP combined with transoral robotic thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid carcinoma. No intra- or postoperative complications were observed. Serum levels of parathyroid hormone, total calcium, and ionized calcium decreased to normal postoperatively and continued to decrease during the follow-up period., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study suggests that TORP holds promise for the treatment of patients with PHPT with the advantages of the robotic procedure, including dynamic visualization and meticulous dissection.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Asian Surgical Association and Taiwan Society of Coloproctology.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Revision stapes surgery is a challenging procedure performed in relatively small numbers compared to other middle ear procedures. Despite numerous data on hearing results of different middle ear surgeries, the audiological standards for successful outcome of this procedure are still not clarified. On the basis of well-documented data, we wanted to determine what the expected audiological results and complications are after revision stapes surgery in order to set a realistic threshold for surgical success., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: After the protocol registration in the PROSPERO database, a systematic review was performed in multiple databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceOpen, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar) according to PRISMA guidelines. Twelve articles were reviewed according to the inclusion criteria. A total of 1032 cases were obtained for evaluation. A modified version of Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess publication quality., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Average air-bone gap (ABG) gain was 17.3 dB, average air conduction (AC) gain was 17.5 dB. The average postoperative air-bone gap was 11.1 dB. The postoperative ABG distribution was the following 0-10 dB: 53.3%, > 10-20 dB: 28.2%, > 20 dB: 18.5%. SNHL as a surgical complication was described in a total of 17 cases (1.6%), no equilibrium disorder was reported., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The pooled data suggest that revision stapes surgery is an effective solution after failure of previous stapes surgery. However, the results are clearly inferior to those of primary stapedotomies. Hence, we need to apply different expectations and use different standards in the indication and evaluation of this type of surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Retrospective evaluation of bilateral same-day myringoplasty outcomes., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Patients who underwent bilateral same-day myringoplasty from 2005 to 2019., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Thirty-eight patients underwent bilateral myringoplasty. Mean age was 44.5 years and 55.3% patients were male. Tragal perichondrium-cartilage composite graft was the most frequently used graft material (82.9%). Perforation closure was achieved in 78.9%. Postoperative Pure Tone Average and Air-Bone Gap decreased significantly (p < 0.05), except for the Air-Bone Gap of the right ear (p = 0.058). The complications were cholesteatoma (1.3%), otorrhea (6.6%) and tympanic membrane retraction (1.3%)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Bilateral same-day myringoplasty is a feasible procedure in selected patients. Good anatomic and functional outcomes, as well as a low rate of complications, are achieved with this procedure, improving patient comfort and allowing for a reduction in operation time and costs.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate the anatomic and functional outcomes of type1 tympanoplasty with endoscopic modified butterfly cartilage-perichondrium technique., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In our modification, perichondrium was elevated circumferentially till the attached part of the composite graft was approximately same size and shape of the perforation, cartilage was trimmed based on the perforation but 0.5 mm larger. Cartilage portion of the graft was placed medial to the edge of the perforation, then perichondrium was rolled out and draped on the circumferential raw surface of remaining tympanic membrane around., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: At 4 months postop, the anatomic integrity rate of the tympanic membrane perforation for small & medium sized perforation and large sized perforation group were 100 % and 94 % (p > 0.05). For the small & medium perforation group, the mean pre and 4 months postop ACs were 30 +/- 8 dB and 18 +/- 6.4 dB (p < 0.01). The mean pre and 4 months postop ABGs were 19 +/- 11 dB and 9 +/- 3 dB (p < 0.01). For the large perforation group, the mean pre and 4 months postop ACs were 43 +/- 12.5 dB and 21.5 +/- 7 dB (p < 0.01). The mean pre and 4 months postop ABGs were 34 +/- 8.5 dB and 12.5 +/- 6 dB (p < 0.01). The differences of mean 4 months postop ACs and mean 4 months postop ABGs between the two groups were not significant (p > 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Compared to the conventional inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty technique, large or marginal perforations can be sealed more securely by this modification.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the quality of life (QoL) and hearing thresholds of patients who underwent 2 types of stapes surgery. A retrospective cohort study was performed comparing stapedotomy with NiTiBOND prostheses (n=20) and stapedectomy with autogenous cortical bone columella (n=20), applying the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults outcome measures with hearing thresholds. Univariate comparative statistical methods were applied. The stapedotomy cohort had significantly better values of Social Support Score of the GBI as compared to the stapedectomy cohort (P=.016). No statistically significant difference was detected between the groups in the pre- and postoperative audiological results and the further QoL measures. Apart from the excellent postoperative audiological results of the different types of stapes surgeries, stapedotomy with NiTiBOND prostheses seems to be superior as regards QoL over stapedectomy applying autogenous cortical bone columella.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: This study aimed to explore the impacts of different middle-ear mucosal conditions on the outcomes of type I tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective analysis of 164 patients with chronic otitis media was carried out. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to their mucosal condition. Preoperative hearing levels and air-bone gap (ABG) before and after surgery were compared via the Kruskal-Wallis <ovid:i>H</ovid:i> test. The chi-squared test and Fisher's exact test were used to assess the postoperative complications and impact factors of functional success., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Preoperatively, neither the air conduction nor bone conduction values differed significantly among groups with different mucosal conditions. All of the ABG closed dramatically after type I tympanoplasty (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .05) regardless of the mucosal conditions. The functional success rates were lower when the intratympanic mucosa was moderately or severely edematous compared with mildly edematous or normal (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .05). The disease course, perforation site, and perforation size, as well as the status of the opposite ear, were not related to the auditory functional outcome. The differences in postoperative reotorrhea and reperforation among the 4 groups were not statistically significant., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Preoperative hearing levels were not affected by middle-ear mucosal conditions. The functional success rate was influenced by mucosal conditions, but hearing levels were significantly enhanced after surgical intervention regardless of the mucosal status. Postoperative complications were not related to the mucosal conditions. Thus, type I tympanoplasty is adoptable for mucosal abnormalities when pharmacotherapy cannot result in a healthy tympanum.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Endoscopic ear surgery is no longer a promising technique, but a well-established one. This study aims to compare endoscopic and microscopic tympanoplasty based on current literature evidence, in terms of their efficacy and safety characteristics., <ovid:b>DATA SOURCES</ovid:b>: We conducted a systematic literature search of four medical databases (Pubmed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov), focusing on randomized controlled or observational studies comparing microscopic to endoscopic tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>REVIEW METHODS</ovid:b>: Data related to the efficacy and safety of each technique were extracted. Outcome data were summarized using pooled mean differences or pooled odds ratio along with their 95% confidence intervals. The risk of bias was estimated, by using the ROBINS-I and RoB-II assessment tools, while the overall quality of evidence was evaluated according to the GRADE working group., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Thirty-three studies, with 2646 patients in total, were included in the meta-analysis. Success rate was evaluated by estimating tympanic graft failure (pooled mean difference:-0.23; 95% CI: -0.61, 0.14, I<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 33.42%), and air-bone gap improvement (pooled mean difference:-0.05; 95% CI:-0.23, 0.13, I<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 52.69%), resulting in comparable outcomes for the two techniques. A statistically significant difference favoring the endoscopic technique was detected regarding postoperative wound infection (OR: -1.72; 95% CI: -3.39, -0.04, I<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0%), dysgeusia (OR: -1.47; 95% CI: -2.47, -0.47, I<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0%), otitis externa development (OR: -1.96; 95% CI: -3.23, -0.69, I<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0%), auricular numbness (OR: -2.56; 95% CI: -3.93, -1.19, I<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 0%), as well as surgical duration (OR: -1.86; 95% CI: -2.70, -1.02, I<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 43.95%), when compared to the postauricular microscopic approach., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic tympanoplasty is an innovative alternative to the microscopic technique, resulting in commensurate outcomes regarding success rate. Furthermore, it offers superior results concerning postoperative complications, while it presents a significant reduction in the duration of surgery, mainly when it is compared to the postauricular microscopic approach., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: NA Laryngoscope, 134:3466-3476, 2024.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - This study investigates the performance of personalised middle ear prostheses under static pressure through a combined approach of numerical analysis and experimental validation. The sound transmission performances of both normal and reconstructed middle ears undergo changes under high positive or negative pressure within the middle ear cavity. This pressure fluctuation has the potential to result in prosthesis displacement/extrusion in patients. To optimise the design of middle ear prostheses, it is crucial to consider various factors, including the condition of the middle ear cavity in which the prosthesis is placed. The integration of computational modelling techniques with non-invasive imaging modalities has demonstrated significant promise and distinct prospects in middle ear surgery. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of Finite Element (FE) analysis in modelling the responses of both normal and reconstructed middle ears to elevated static pressure within the ear canal. The FE model underwent validation using experimental data derived from human cadaveric temporal bones before progressing to subsequent investigations. Afterwards, we assessed stapes and umbo displacements in the reconstructed middle ear under static pressure, with either a columella-type prosthesis or a prosthetic incus, closely resembling a healthy incus. Results indicated the superior performance of the prosthetic incus in terms of both sound transmission to the inner ear and stress distribution patterns on the TM, potentially lowering the risk of prosthesis displacement/extrusion. This study underscores the potential of computational analysis in middle ear surgery, encompassing aspects such as prosthesis design, predicting outcomes in ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR), and mitigating experimental costs.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is common in pediatric patients undergoing general anesthesia, and clinicians seek prophylactic interventions to prevent its ill effects on patients as well as its ramifications on perioperative care. We sought to assess the body of evidence around prophylactic strategies, both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic, targeting pediatric PONV., <ovid:b>SOURCE</ovid:b>: We searched MEDLINE, MEDLINE ePubs Ahead of Print and In-Process Citations, Embase Classic+Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CENTRAL (via the Ovid platform), Scopus (Elsevier), Web of Science (Clarivate Analytics), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number Registry, from their inception to 23 September 2022., <ovid:b>PRINCIPAL FINDINGS</ovid:b>: Of 188 clinical trials, 157 (83%) investigated pharmacologic interventions, 25 (13%) investigated nonpharmacologic interventions, and six (3%) investigated mixed pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. The most common surgeries investigated for pediatric PONV were strabismus surgery (68 trials, 36%) and tonsillectomy or tympanoplasty (45 trials, 23%). Of four measurement tools used to assess PONV in the included trials, the most common was clinical judgement (170 trials, 90%)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The majority of data in pediatric PONV prophylaxis is based on pharmacologic interventions, with a paucity of research in nonpharmacologic or mixed interventions. Assessing and documenting PONV using tools such as the Baxter Animated Retching Faces Scale or PONV numeric scoring system may help standardize pediatric PONV prophylaxis research moving forward. Furthermore, concurrently assessing pain and adverse effects associated with PONV might further inform our understanding of this complex clinical entity.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Our objective was to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the clinical outcomes after endoscopic and microscopic type I tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Randomized controlled trials, two-arm prospective studies, and retrospective studies were included., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were searched until March 1, 2022 using the combinations of search terms: "endoscopic," "microscopic," and "tympanoplasty.", <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Two independent reviewers utilized the abovementioned search strategy to identify eligible studies. If any uncertainty existed regarding eligibility, a third reviewer was consulted. Primary outcome measures were graft success rate, air-bone gap (ABG) improvement, and operative time. Secondary outcomes were the rate of need for canalplasty, the proportion of self-rated excellent cosmetic results, and pain visual analog scale (VAS)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Forty-three studies enrolled a total of 3712 patients who were undergoing type I tympanoplasty and were finally included. The pooled result showed endoscopic approach was significantly associated with shorter operative time (difference in means: -20.021, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -31.431 to -8.611), less need for canalplasty (odds ratio [OR]: 0.065, 95% CI: 0.026-0.164), more self-rated excellent cosmetic results (OR: 87.323, 95% CI: 26.750-285.063), and lower pain VAS (difference in means: -2.513, 95% CI: -4.737 to -0.228). No significant differences in graft success rate or ABG were observed between the two procedures., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic type I tympanoplasty provides a similar graft success rate, improvement in ABG, and reperforation rate to microscopic tympanoplasty with a shorter operative time, better self-rated cosmetic results, and less pain. Unless contraindicated, the endoscopic approach should be the procedure of choice in type I tympanoplasty.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Middle ear surgery involves reconstruction of the ossicular chain, predominately using rigid implants. New middle ear prostheses strive to mimic the physiologic micromovements of the ossicular chain and prevent dislocation, protrusion, and preloading of the annular ligament due to pressure fluctuations., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Thirty-five patients were included in a monocentric, prospective observational study. Patients received tympanoplasty with ossicular reconstruction using the mCLIP ARC partial prosthesis. This titanium prosthesis is equipped with a clip mechanism for coupling at the stapes and a ball joint connecting headplate and shaft. At short-term (ST) and mid-term (MT) follow-up, pure-tone audiometry was performed and the pure tone average of 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz (PTA4) was calculated. The audiological outcome was compared with retrospective data of the Dresden titanium clip prosthesis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The new prosthesis shows favorable clinical results. Pure-tone audiometry showed satisfactory results in ST and MT follow-up, with the PTA4 air-bone gap (ABG) decreasing from 24.5 (+/-11) dB to 17.4 (+/-7.9) dB at the ST follow-up at 27 days to 15.6 (+/-10.3) dB at MT follow-up at 196 days (n = 32). A PTA4-ABG value of less than 20 dB was achieved by 63% of patients at ST follow-up and by 77% at MT follow-up. There was no significant difference in PTA4 ABG compared to the Dresden titanium clip prosthesis during ST follow-up (p = 0.18)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The mCLIP ARC partial prosthesis, a new middle ear prosthesis with a balanced ball joint, shows promising audiological results and is a safe and effective choice for patients with chronic ear disease., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 3 Laryngoscope, 134:3323-3328, 2024.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 The Authors.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> To study the difference of postoperative efficacy between two-person three-hand ear endoscopy and microscopic tympanoplasty in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media, and to explore the advantages and disadvantages of two-person three-hand ear endoscopy. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Methods:</ovid:b> A retrospective study was conducted on 100 patients who underwent tympanoplasty in the Department of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery of Hunan People's Hospital from April 2019 to March 2023, and they were divided into 2 groups with 50 cases each according to random number table method. Among them, 50 cases underwent endoscopic tympanoplasty in two-person three-hand(group A) and 50 cases underwent routine microscopic tympanoplasty(group B). The operation and postoperative conditions of the two groups were followed up. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> In group A, the mean operation time was(65.78+/-18.21) min, the mean intraoperative blood loss was(12.94+/-4.46) mL, the postoperative pain score was(1.82+/-0.60) points, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was(2.76+/-0.72) d. The mean operation time of group B was(89.45+/-20.38) min, the mean intraoperative blood loss was(22.78+/-5.74) mL, the postoperative pain score was(2.98+/-0.85) points, and the mean postoperative hospital stay was(3.82+/-0.75) d, which with statistical significance between the two groups(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.05). Hearing in both groups was significantly improved 6 months after surgery, and the difference was statistically significant before and after surgery(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.05), but there was no significant difference between the two groups before surgery and 6 months after surgery(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>>0.05). There were 2 cases in group A(4%) and 1 case in group B(2%) complicated with tympanic cord injury during operation, and the difference was not statistically significant(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>>0.05). There were 47 cases of A group(94%) of one-time healing of tympanic membrane after operation, 48 cases(96%) of group B, and the difference was not statistically significant(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>>0.05). <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> There is no significant difference in cure rate and hearing improvement between two-person three-hand ear endoscopic tympanoplasty and conventional microscope surgery, and the operation time is significantly shortened, the amount of blood loss is less, and the postoperative recovery is faster. It has the advantages of clear operating field, two-person three-hand operation, minimally invasive, and can reach the range of middle ear tympanic sinus and mastoid apex, and the surgical complications are seldom, which is worth promoting.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright&#xa9; by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Otosclerosis is the primary cause of conductive hearing loss with normal otoscopy. As the condition worsens, certain patients may develop a sensorineural component. Patients with successful surgeries may still need hearing aids, which creates a dilemma for health professionals as there are insufficient data to make informed decisions. This study investigated the influence of the surgeon's proficiency level, individual patient factors (e.g., age at the time of intervention and survival rates), and surgery costs on the cost-effectiveness of stapes surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using an adapted Markov model incorporating annual all-cause mortalities. In addition, we introduced sensitivity analyses to address the effects of surgical expertise on adults with bilateral conductive hearing loss due to otosclerosis. A model was developed based on a decision tree with treatment options and complication scenarios for otosclerosis patients undergoing stapes surgery or receiving hearing aids. Annual all-cause mortality was considered. A sensitivity analysis was performed assigned to different training levels ("experts" and "less experienced") to simulate the effects of surgical experience on the cost-effectiveness of surgical outcomes. Successful surgery was defined as closing of the air-bone gap to 10 dB or less. Based on published data, "experts" were simulated with a 93.7% success rate, and "less experienced" were manufactured with a 68.9% success rate., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Stapes surgery provides improved quality of life (QoL) compared to hearing aids with lower cumulative costs up to 87 years of age in the case of "expert" surgeons and up to 78 years of age, when performed by "less experienced" surgeons., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Primary stapes surgery is highly cost-effective and delivers improved QoL compared to hearing aids with lower cumulative costs. Additionally, undergoing stapes surgical training remains highly cost-effective.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Hearing impairment is an established independent risk factor for delirium.Whether preoperative hearing impairment is associated with postoperative emergence agitation (POEA) in elderly patients remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association between preoperative hearing impairment and POEA in elderly patients undergoing ear surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This prospective observational study was carried out at an otologic centre in a tertiary hospital between July 15, 2020, and February 28, 2021. Data of 417 elderly patients who underwent microscopic and endoscopic middle ear surgery were analyzed. Pure tone average was used to assess preoperative hearing function, with a PTA >= 50 dB indicating severe hearing impairment. POEA was measured using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the association between preoperative hearing function and POEA., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of the 417 participants, 45.8% were men, and the median age was 64 (interquartile range: 62-67) years old. Severe preoperative hearing impairment was present in 113 patients (27.1%), and POEA occurred in 42 patients (10.1%). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that severe preoperative hearing impairment was associated with an increased risk of POEA (odds ratio: 2.031; 95% confidence interval: 1.044-3.954, P = 0.037)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Pending confirmative studies, these findings suggest that severe preoperative hearing impairment could serve as an independent predictor of POEA in older patients undergoing middle ear surgery. These results highlight the need for further research to better understand the biomarker and pathogenesis of POEA, leading to identification of targeted interventions of POEA and improvement of postoperative outcomes in patients.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Inflammatory conditions such as chronic otitis media (COM) can cause irreversible impairments in the microarchitecture and functions of the incus, which subsequently leads to conductive hearing loss., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To investigate bone mineral density (BMD) of the incus body (IB) and long process (ILP) on preoperative temporal CT in COM patients with and without incudo-stapedial joint discontinuity (ISJD), and also to determine the association between BMD values and the postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) in the ISJD group., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The mean IB density (IBD)/occipital bone density (OBD) and ILP density (ILPD)/OBD values were compared between the patients with and without ISJD. The correlation between ABG gain and preoperative incus density values was assessed in the ISJD group., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The mean IBD/OBD and ILPD/OBD values were significantly higher in patients with intact ISJ. There was a moderate positive correlation between postoperative ABG gain and ILPD/OBD values in the ISJD group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE</ovid:b>: The decrease in BMD of the incus may involve ILP as well as IB in patients with ISJD caused by ILP lysis in COM. A higher preoperative ILPD/OBD was correlated with a higher postoperative ABG gain in COM patients with ISJD.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Middle ear cholesteatoma may lead to the erosion of the bony structures of the temporal bone, possibly causing intra- and extracranial complications. Surgical treatment is mandatory, and due to possible residual/recurrent disease, the use of reliable diagnostic methods is essential. Our study aimed to evaluate the reliability of non-EPI DW-MRI for the follow-up of cholesteatoma after surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In a study group including 53 consecutive patients who underwent surgery for cholesteatoma at a tertiary university hospital, an imaging protocol was applied, including non-echo planar diffusion-weighted imaging magnetic resonance (MR) at 1 month after surgery and then at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Based on the combination of preoperative assessment and intraoperative findings, the study group was divided into 3 subgroups: petrous bone (PB) cholesteatoma, complicated cholesteatoma and uncomplicated cholesteatoma. PB cholesteatoma patients were treated by a subtotal petrosectomy, whereas complicated and uncomplicated cholesteatoma patients were treated either by a canal wall up procedure or a retrograde (inside-out) canal wall down technique with bone obliteration technique (BOT)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The results show that patients who had positive findings on non-EPI DW-MRI scans 1 month after surgery consequently underwent revision surgery during which residual cholesteatoma was noted. All the patients who displayed negative findings on non-EPI DWI-MRI scan at 1 month after surgery did not show the presence of a lesion at the 6- and 12-month evaluations. The 6 patients who displayed residual cholesteatoma at the 1-month follow-up presented dehiscence/exposure of the facial nerve canal at the primary surgery, mostly at the level of the labyrinthine segment., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Non-EPI DW-MRI is a useful and reliable tool for follow-up cholesteatoma surgery, and when applied early, as was done in the protocol proposed in the present study, this tool may be used to detect the presence of residual cholesteatoma in some patients, prompting the planning of early revision surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: As artificial intelligence (AI) is integrating into the healthcare sphere, there is a need to evaluate its effectiveness in the various subspecialties of medicine, including otolaryngology. Our study intends to provide a cursory review of ChatGPT's diagnostic capability, ability to convey pathophysiology in simple terms, accuracy in providing management recommendations, and appropriateness in follow up and post-operative recommendations in common otolaryngologic conditions., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Adenotonsillectomy (T&A), tympanoplasty (TP), endoscopic sinus surgery (ESS), parotidectomy (PT), and total laryngectomy (TL) were substituted for the word procedure in the following five questions and input into ChatGPT version 3.5: "How do I know if I need (procedure)," "What are treatment alternatives to (procedure)," "What are the risks of (procedure)," "How is a (procedure) performed," and "What is the recovery process for (procedure)?" Two independent study members analyzed the output and discrepancies were reviewed, discussed, and reconciled between study members., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In terms of management recommendations, ChatGPT was able to give generalized statements of evaluation, need for intervention, and the basics of the procedure without major aberrant errors or risks of safety. ChatGPT was successful in providing appropriate treatment alternatives in all procedures tested. When queried for methodology, risks, and procedural steps, ChatGPT lacked precision in the description of procedural steps, missed key surgical details, and did not accurately provide all major risks of each procedure. In terms of the recovery process, ChatGPT showed promise in T&A, TP, ESS, and PT but struggled in the complexity of TL, stating the patient could speak immediately after surgery without speech therapy., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: ChatGPT accurately demonstrated the need for intervention, management recommendations, and treatment alternatives in common ENT procedures. However, ChatGPT was not able to replace an otolaryngologist's clinical reasoning necessary to discuss procedural methodology, risks, and the recovery process in complex procedures. As AI becomes further integrated into healthcare, there is a need to continue to explore its indications, evaluate its limits, and refine its use to the otolaryngologist's advantage.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: In otosurgical training, cadaveric temporal bones are primarily used to provide a realistic tactile experience. However, using cadaveric temporal bones is challenging due to their limited availability, high cost, and potential for infection. Utilizing current three-dimensional (3D) technologies could overcome the limitations associated with cadaveric bones. This study focused on how a 3D-printed middle ear model can be used in otosurgical training., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A cadaveric temporal bone was imaged using microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) to generate a 3D model of the middle ear. The final model was printed from transparent photopolymers using a laser-based 3D printer (vat photopolymerization), yielding a 3D-printed phantom of the external ear canal and middle ear. The feasibility of this phantom for otosurgical training was evaluated through an ossiculoplasty simulation involving ten otosurgeons and ten otolaryngology-head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) residents. The participants were tasked with drilling, scooping, and placing a 3D-printed partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP). Following the simulation, a questionnaire was used to collect the participants' opinions and feedback., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A transparent photopolymer was deemed suitable for both the middle ear phantom and PORP. The printing procedure was precise, and the anatomical landmarks were recognizable. Based on the evaluations, the phantom had realistic maneuverability, although the haptic feedback during drilling and scooping received some criticism from ORL-HNS residents. Both otosurgeons and ORL-HNS residents were optimistic about the application of these 3D-printed models as training tools., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The 3D-printed middle ear phantom and PORP used in this study can be used for low-threshold training in the future. The integration of 3D-printed models in conventional otosurgical training holds significant promise.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024. The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> This study aims to investigate the current application and the level of knowledge of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring among medical staff in China. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Methods:</ovid:b> A comprehensive online questionnaire was conducted among medical professionals across different regions in China from October 2022 to February 2023. The survey exclusively targeted departments specializing in otolaryngology, head and neck surgery, neurosurgery, and oral and maxillofacial surgery. The questionnaire covered various aspects including general information, intraoperative facial nerve monitoring practices, training history, indications for monitoring, parameters used during monitoring procedures, as well as factors influencing its implementation. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> A total of 417 participants from 31 provincial, municipal, and autonomous regions were included. Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring was found to be implemented in 227 (54.4%,227/417) repondents of 53 institutions (24.9%, 53/213). The top three indications for implementing this technique were acoustic neuroma, parotid gland surgery, and modified middle ear surgery (mastoidectomy). Herein 81.1%(184/227) medical staff involved in intraoperative facial nerve monitoring had received relevant training, 57.3%(130/227)-92.1%(209/227) reported a lack of clear description regarding recording thresholds, stimulation currents/frequencies/wave widths. <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> The majority of the institutions surveyed have not yet adopted intraoperative facial nerve monitoring. Furthermore, significant gaps concerning the procedure exist. It is imperative to establish standards or guidelines to promote its better development and application.

N2  - <ovid:b>Background:</ovid:b> The preoperative evaluation of Congenital Malformation of the Middle and Outer Ear (CMMOE) is very important. Jahrsdoerfer score commonly used at present, based on CT scanning images of the temporal bone, is often unable to accurately evaluate deformity and hearing level. <ovid:b>Aims/Objectives:</ovid:b> To investigate and promote a straightforward and easily accessible assessment method, pure tone audiometry, for the evaluation of CMMOE. <ovid:b>Material and Methods:</ovid:b> A total of 223 cases (244 ears) CMMOE with hearing data were retrospectively analyzed. Among them, 180 cases (197 ears) underwent exploratory tympanoplasty with clear conditions: ossicle numbers in 136 cases (147 ears) and morphology in 128 cases (138 ears) and vestibular window development in 137 cases (146 ears), and CT scans of temporal bone in 113 cases (120 ears). 1). The correlation was analyzed between ossicle numbers, ossicle morphology, Jahrsdoerfer score groups and their corresponding Average Air-Conduction Threshold of pure tone (AACT) at 0.5-4 KHz. 2) The AACT difference is compared among the above groups respectively and between the developed and undeveloped groups of vestibular window at 0.5-4 KHz and each frequency of 0.125-8 KHz. Spearman method was used for correlation analysis (calculating coefficient r and <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> values). For the data followed a normal distribution, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and <ovid:i>t</ovid:i>-test were employed, otherwise, Kruskal Wallis multiple local rank coincidence test and Wilcoxon rank sum test were used. <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> <0 .05 was considered statistically significant. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> 1) The correlation coefficients between the groups of ossicle number scores, ossicle morphology scores, Jahrsdoerfer scores and their corresponding AACT are r = -0.187 (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> <0 .05), r = -0.073 (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> >0 .05) and r = -0.079 (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> > 0.05), respectively. 2) Comparison of AACT difference based on ossicle number or morphological scores and Jahrsdoerfer scores with <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> > 0.05 among all groups, respectively. The AACT difference between the developed and undeveloped vestibular window groups is 5.5 (63.5/69.0) dB HL(<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .05) at 0.5-4KHz, out of 0.125-8 KHz frequency 1, 2, 4 KHz were 5.7 (65.0/70.7) dB HL, 8.4 (60.7/69.1) dB HL and 2 (61.5/63.5) dB HL, respectively, all <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.05, the other frequencies with all <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> > 0.05. <ovid:b>Conclusions and Significance:</ovid:b> 1) Ossicle number was correlated with AACT, but not for ossicle morphology and Jahrsdoerfer scores. 2) There was no significant difference in AACT corresponding to ossicle number or morphology scores and Jahrsdoerfer scores groups, but the patients with undeveloped vestibular window had poorer hearing than those with developed ones. Therefore, the AACT can evaluate the development of ossicle and vestibular window, and more directly reflect the hearing level than Jahrsdoerfer score. Pure tone audiometry is simple, widely used, and easily accessible, which making it a new assessment method of CMMOE.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective</ovid:b>: This research was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effects of tympanoplasty on patients with chronic otitis media with tinnitus and analyze the possible influencing factors for patient prognosis., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: This is a pre-post control group study, 86 patients with chronic otitis media were included as the subjects and enrolled into tinnitus group (n = 46) and the non-tinnitus group (n = 40). All patients underwent tympanoplasty under microscope or ear endoscopy. A tinnitus severity and efficacy assessment scale was employed for the evaluation of the severity of tinnitus among the subjects. In addition, tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) was utilized to evaluate disease alleviation., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: Before treatment, the proportions of the patients with tinnitus at grades I, II, III, IV, and V amounted to 15.22%, 32.61%, 21.74%, 17.39%, and 13.04%, respectively, while they were 30.43%, 45.65%, 13.04%, 8.71%, and 2.17%, respectively 3 months after treatment (P < .05). THI scores for the patients in the tinnitus group before and 3 months after treatment amounted to 17.96 +/- 3.66 and 16.21 +/- 3.29, respectively (P < .05). After treatment, the air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) thresholds and air-bone gap (ABG) of the two groups apparently declined (P < .05). No statistical significance was detected in the differences in disease classification, disease courses, and whether an electric drill was used among the patients between effective and invalid groups (P > .05)., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: To some extent, tympanoplasty alleviated tinnitus among patients with chronic otitis media and promoted the restoration of hearing. Hence, it is worthy of application in clinical treatment.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The optimal timing for surgery to promote postoperative recovery in children with congenital stenosis of the external auditory canal with external auditory canal cholesteatoma, who are susceptible to exudative inflammation of middle ear and mastoid process, is still uncertain., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To investigate the treatment of congenital stenosis of external auditory canal with external auditory canal cholesteatoma complicated with exudative inflammation., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective analysis of 45 patients with congenital stenosis of external auditory canal with external auditory canal cholesteatoma complicated with mastoiditis. Based on whether effusion had resolved at the time of surgery, the patients were divided into two groups. Pure-tone audiometry tests were performed before and after surgery for both groups., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The average postoperative duration of dry ear was 36.38 days in Group 1 and 47.90 days in Group 2 (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.05). Among patients who underwent hearing reconstruction, the average air conduction threshold decreased by 15-36 dBHL in Group 1 and by 7-22 dBHL in Group 2 (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE</ovid:b>: The postoperative outcomes of dry ear and hearing improvement can be enhanced by performing operation after effusion resolution in cases of congenital external auditory canal stenosis with external auditory canal cholesteatoma exudative inflammation.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: With the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), a validated measurement instrument for the assessment of disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been available internationally since 2000. The aim of this study was to provide a validated German version of this international instrument and to compare it with the German Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15)., <ovid:b>METHODOLOGY</ovid:b>: The CES was translated into German via a forward-backward translation process. For validation, 79 patients with COM undergoing middle ear surgery were prospectively included. HRQoL was determined preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively using the CES and the COMOT-15. Pure tone audiometry was also performed at both measurement time points. In the control examination, an additional retrospective assessment of the preoperative situation was additionally performed using the CES and the COMOT-15 to assess the response shift. The determined psychometric characteristics were internal consistency, test-retest reliability, discrimination validity, agreement validity, responsiveness, and response shift for both measurement instruments. Convergent validity of both measurement instruments was assessed using linear regression., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: On the basis of the CES, patients with COM could be reliably distinguished from patients with healthy ears. The CES showed satisfactory reliability with high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha 0.65-0.85) and high retest reliability (r> 0.8). The global assessment of HRQoL impairment correlated very well with the scores of the CES (r= 0.51). In addition, it showed a high sensitivity to change (standardized response mean -0.86). Compared to the COMOT-15, it showed a lower response shift (effect size -0.17 vs. 0.44). Both measurement instruments correlated only slightly with air conduction hearing threshold (r= 0.29 and r= 0.24, respectively). The concordant validity of both measurement instruments was high (r= 0.68)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The German version of the CES shows satisfactory psychometric characteristics, so that its use can be recommended. The CES focuses on the influence of ear symptoms on HRQoL, whereas the COMOT-15 also includes functional and psychological aspects. Due to only minor response shift effects, the CES is particularly suitable for studies with multiple repeat measurements.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023. The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study aimed to identify what proportion of middle-ear surgery patients utilise the internet for information and to characterise which resources and media formats are used and for what durations., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: A single-arm, retrospective cohort study was performed using an online survey of English-speaking patients who underwent middle-ear surgery over a three-year period across two otology practices., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of 260 invitees, 165 responded. A total of 122 used online resources: 9.8 per cent used online resources for less than 15 minutes, 27.0 per cent used them for 15 to 29 minutes, 27.0 per cent used them for 30 to 59 minutes and 36.1 per cent used them for 60 minutes or more. Of online users with complete responses (108 of 122), the most used resources (used for 12 minutes or more) were: written information (73.1 per cent); surgeons' websites (55.6 per cent); pictures, diagrams or photos (42.6 per cent); videos (37.0 per cent); and social media (10.2 per cent)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: At least 46.9 per cent of patients undergoing elective ear surgery use online resources. Most time is spent using written information, pictures, diagrams, photos and videos. Therefore, it is increasingly essential that accurate and informative resources in these formats are readily available online.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Variations along the facial nerve (FN) course present considerable challenges in the surgical treatment of otosclerosis, often complicating the procedure. Existing knowledge of its tympanic tract and its implications primarily comes from microscopical procedures. This study aims to assess endoscopic findings of FN anatomy in a healthy tympanic cavity and its impact on the stapedotomy procedure, focusing on the risk of complications and functional hearing outcomes., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective study on exclusive endoscopic stapedotoplasties between October 2014 and October 2021 at our Otorhinolaryngology University Department was carried out. An evaluation of intraoperative endoscopic findings reviewed in surgical descriptive and/or video records was conducted to assess their potential negative impact on the surgery. Demographic data, preoperative and postoperative hearing thresholds, as well as intraoperative and postoperative complications were analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: One hundred fifty-seven subjects were included. A FN partially overhanging the oval window was observed in 7.3% (n=12): 10 prolapsing with bony canal dehiscence and 2 without any detected dehiscence. Each procedure was successfully completed without any issues related to the anomalous anatomy, and in no case, switching to the microscope for the handling of the prosthesis near the dehiscent nerve was required. No facial paralysis occurred, with an early- or long-term postoperative House-Brackman grade of 1 (n=157, 100%). Only 3/157 patients (1.9%) showed a sensorineural threshold reduction of >=20 dB HL, but a significant air-bone gap improvement was observed (mean closure of 18.36 dB HL, P -lt; .0001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The endoscope promotes a concrete description of tympanic FN anatomy, and endoscopic stapes surgery appears to be a safe and viable option when dehiscent or prolapsed FNs reduce the footplate's exposure.

N2  - <b><br>Introduction:</b> In chronic otitis media, the reconstruction of the middle ear's sound conducting system involves repairing the tympanic membrane and filling the space between ossicular chain remnants. The final shape of the prosthesis is usually determined intraoperatively. However, the ossicular chain may be preoperatively measured using computed tomography (CT) scans, and an individualized prosthesis can be designed. Custom 3D printing seems to be an attractive solution for optimal adjustment.</br> <b><br>Aim:</b> Our study aimed to assess the 3D-printed custom prosthesis movability and compare it to the original ossicular chain.</br> <b><br>Material and methods:</b> Five fresh-frozen temporal bone specimens were used. Using Cone-Beam CT scans, the incus model was designed individually and 3D-printed. The ossicular chain was reconstructed inside the cadaveric temporal bone. Acoustic stimuli were applied to the external ear canal one frequency at a time. The laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV) measured the intact and 3D-printed prosthesis reconstructed ossicular chain vibrations.</br> <b><br>Results:</b> At all stimulation frequencies, there was no significant difference in velocity values between the intact and reconstructed ossicular chain at the intensity of 80 dB SPL. The obtained values of the velocity gain were: -7.9 (SD-19) dB, -6.8 (SD8.12) dB, -10,9 (SD-5.3) dB, -7.4 (SD-8.16) dB for 500 Hz, 1000 Hz, 2000 Hz, 4000 Hz, respectively. The vibration threshold shift values ranged between -0.57 dB at 500 Hz and 3.81 dB at 2000 Hz.</br> <b><br>Conclusions:</b> This study analyzed the movability of individualized 3D-printed custom ossicular prostheses using LDV. Compared to the intact ossicular chain, the reconstructed ossicular chain movability was characterized by statistically insignificant reduced movability at all tested frequencies. Because the prosthesis's new design conception as custom 3D individualized printing allows for patient-specific ossiculoplasty, it represents a promising new direction for ossicular chain reconstruction. It seems to be an attractive solution for prosthesis optimal adjustment and, hopefully, better hearing results.</br&gt.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Within otologic surgery, a paucity of well-controlled studies assessing the use of systemic antibiotic to reduce surgical site infections exists. Moreover, discrepancies in wound classification of procedures challenge consensus in antimicrobial prescribing patterns. We sought to compare surgeons from two different health systems to examine how surgeons' prescribing habits compared to practice guidelines for numerous otologic procedures., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: An online questionnaire was distributed to 33 Canadian and 32 Austrian surgeons who regularly perform otologic surgery. Current systemic antibiotic prescribing habits for cochlear implantation, cholesteatoma surgery, stapes surgery, and tympanoplasty +/- ossiculoplasty were collected., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Eighteen of 33 (54.5%) Canadian surgeons provided responses, while 18 of 32 (56.3%) of Austrian surgeons answered. Clear consistency with clinical practice guidelines exists for pre-operative antibiotics use in cochlear implant surgery and infected cholesteatoma surgery. However, for stapes surgery and tympanoplasty +/- ossiculoplasty, consensus is lacking for both pre- and post-operative antibiotic prescribing habits. Notable differences between the two countries include post-operative antibiotics for cochlear implant surgery (Austria: 36.4%, Canada: 71.4%) and uninfected cholesteatoma surgery (Austria: 33.3%, Canada: 77.8%). Across all procedures, both induction and post-operative antibiotic administration was not significantly associated with surgeon seniority when stratified by five-year increments., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The lack of consensus among each country's otologic surgeons underscores the uncertainty in wound classification and thus, adherence to clinical practice guidelines.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in the quality of life of patients who underwent Type 1 tympanoplasty using the Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire 12 (COMQ-12)., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Prospectively collected data of patients aged between 18-65 years, who had undergone type 1 tympanoplasty between January 2018 to January 2019 were included in the study. The Turkish version of COMQ-12 was completed by all of the patients preoperatively as well as 12 months postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative graft uptake outcomes, hearing assessment results, and scores of COMQ-12 were evaluated. Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon test were used., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 98 patients were included. Noticeable improvement in the severity of symptoms, negative effect on daily life and work routine, health care, and general well-being was detected by subjective scores of the questionnaire. The COMQ-12 preoperative and postoperative overall average score was 25 and 7, respectively (p<0.001). Graft uptake success was found to be 85%. Hearing assessment evaluation showed a mean change in air conduction values of 8.78 (SD 1.17), and a mean change in air-bone gap values of 7 (SD 0.8), both showing statistical significance (p<0.001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: According to the COMQ-12 questionnaire data after surgery, symptom severity, lifestyle and work impact, health service impact, and general discomfort were significantly reduced.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To provide insight into the intraoperative management, admission course, pain management, and graft success of microscope- and endoscope-assisted tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective Chart Review., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This study included children 18 years and younger who underwent ambulatory tympanoplasty at a tertiary pediatric hospital between January 2018 and December 2020. Medical records were reviewed and information about intraoperative factors, surgical approach, laterality, complications, and post-operative perforation closure success rates was collected. Multivariate analysis was performed to compare and contrast the two surgical approaches., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The review included 321 pediatric patients who underwent a tympanoplasty. Endoscopic tympanoplasty accounted for 17.4%, while microscopic tympanoplasty accounted for 82.6%. In both approaches, the rate of intraoperative complications, postoperative complications, audiological improvements, and perforation closure success rates were statistically similar. However, patients who underwent endoscopic tympanoplasty were 3.96 times less likely to require opioids in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and had a shorter post-operative admission length. This pattern emerged regardless of the type of graft used. Obtaining an autograft was not associated with a higher opioid requirement in the PACU., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: While both approaches are viable, our findings demonstrate the reduced need for opioids with similar success rates following an endoscopic tympanoplasty. Ultimately, the trade-off for the minimally invasive endoscopic approach appears to be a less painful experience for the child while promoting clinically appropriate opioid stewardship in the perioperative setting.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Periodontal disease is a multifactorial, bacterially induced inflammatory condition characterized by the progressive destruction of periodontal tissues. The successful nonsurgical treatment of periodontitis requires multifunctional technologies offering antibacterial therapies and promotion of bone regeneration simultaneously. For the first time, in this study, an injectable piezoelectric hydrogel (PiezoGEL) was developed after combining gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) with biocompatible piezoelectric fillers of barium titanate (BTO) that produce electrical charges when stimulated by biomechanical vibrations (e.g., mastication, movements). We harnessed the benefits of hydrogels (injectable, light curable, conforms to pocket spaces, biocompatible) with the bioactive effects of piezoelectric charges. A thorough biomaterial characterization confirmed piezoelectric fillers' successful integration with the hydrogel, photopolymerizability, injectability for clinical use, and electrical charge generation to enable bioactive effects (antibacterial and bone tissue regeneration). PiezoGEL showed significant reductions in pathogenic biofilm biomass (~41%), metabolic activity (~75%), and the number of viable cells (~2-3log) compared to hydrogels without BTO fillers in vitro. Molecular analysis related the antibacterial effects to be associated with reduced cell adhesion (downregulation of <ovid:i>porP</ovid:i> and <ovid:i>fimA</ovid:i>) and increased oxidative stress (upregulation of <ovid:i>oxyR</ovid:i>) genes. Moreover, PiezoGEL significantly enhanced bone marrow stem cell (BMSC) viability and osteogenic differentiation by upregulating <ovid:i>RUNX2, COL1A1</ovid:i>, and <ovid:i>ALP</ovid:i>. In vivo, PiezoGEL effectively reduced periodontal inflammation and increased bone tissue regeneration compared to control groups in a mice model. Findings from this study suggest PiezoGEL to be a promising and novel therapeutic candidate for the treatment of periodontal disease nonsurgically.

N2  - <ovid:b>IMPORTANCE</ovid:b>: The optimal surgical management of cholesteatoma remains controversial. Within pediatric otolaryngology, one of the most vital points of contention is the selection of canal wall-up (CWU) versus canal wall-down (CWD) procedures. Pediatric cholesteatoma has high rates of recurrence (16%-54%). In adults, there is evidence that the selection of surgical techniques affects recurrence rates. This has not been shown in children., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: 1. To systematically review the literature on recurrent and residual cholesteatoma after CWU and CWD in children and perform a meta-analysis of the data. 2. To assess the rates of recurrent and residual cholesteatoma between CWU and CWD techniques in pediatric patients. 3. To assess hearing outcomes by evaluating postoperative differences in the air-bone gap (ABG) between CWU and CWD techniques., <ovid:b>DATA SOURCES</ovid:b>: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Collaboration was performed from inception to May 1st, 2020, to identify studies that compared CWU and CWD procedures for acquired cholesteatoma in children., <ovid:b>STUDY SELECTION</ovid:b>: Search records were screened in duplicate by four reviewers. Inclusion criteria consisted of comparative randomized clinical trials and observational studies assessing outcomes of CWU and CWD techniques in the pediatric population. Studies involving patients with congenital cholesteatoma were excluded., <ovid:b>DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS</ovid:b>: Four reviewers working independently and in duplicate systematically reviewed and extracted study data. Dichotomous variables were analyzed as risk ratios (RR), while continuous variables were compared using weighted mean differences (MD). The risk of bias was assessed using the CLARITY Scale., <ovid:b>PRIMARY OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</ovid:b>: The outcomes were recurrence, residual disease, air-bone gap (ABG), and air conductive (AC) thresholds., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: After screening 1036 publications, 17 retrospective cohort studies were selected. 1333 children were included; the overall mean age was ten years (SD 7.9), and the overall mean follow-up time was 5.9 years (SD 6.6). CWU and CWD techniques were performed in 60% (796) and 40% (537) cases. We did not find differences in cholesteatoma recurrence (RR: 1.50, 95% CI 0.94; 2.40; n = 544; I<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> 0%; Tau [2]: 0.00), or rates of residual cholesteatoma (RR 1.51, 95% CI 0.96; 2.38, n = 506; I<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>: 0%; Tau [2]: 0.00) in patients who underwent CWU and CWD mastoidectomy. The mean air-bone gap was lower with CWU than CWD (mean difference: 7.60, 95% CI -10.65; -4.54; n = 242; I<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup>: 71%; Tau [2]: 5.98)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: and relevance: We show similar rates of recurrence and residual disease after either CWU or CWD tympanoplasty. Our results challenge the fundamental principle of CWD surgery as a standard technique, as there is no difference in rates of recurrence and residual disease in CWU and CWD. Moreover, audiometric results support CWU with improved hearing outcomes., <ovid:b>TRIAL REGISTRATION</ovid:b>: PROSPERO identifier: CRD42020184029.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Hearing rehabilitation through middle ear surgery can be challenging, particularly for patients with chronic otitis media, but new hearing devices offer opportunity to reach this goal. The aim was to compare hearing outcomes and quality of life in patients who were converted from a Baha Attract system to the Osia system., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Prospective observational study, in which each subject acted as their own control. Six patients who were converted from a Baha Attract to an Osia system performed audiometric and quality of life assessments with different sound processor at fitting, 3, 6 and 12 months. The speech performance in noise with the Osia system at 12 months, expressed as dB SNR, was compared to the baseline condition (Baha 5)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The PTA4 hearing thresholds improved from 42.6 +/- 11 with Baha 5 Power to 34.8 +/- 13.3 with Baha 5 SuperPower and to 25.4 +/- 3.5 with the Osia at 12 months, leading to a significant functional gain of 17.2 +/- 10.9 dB vs Baha 5 (p < 0.02). Speech understanding in both quiet and noise was clinically improved reaching a mean SNR of less than 1 dB at 12 months with the Osia system. Quality of life outcomes improved by more than 20% at 12-month follow-up., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Aided hearing thresholds and speech understanding in noise improved when patients were converted from the Baha Attract system to the Osia system. The aided hearing threshold was maintained up to 8 kHz (26 dB) with the Osia system.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: With the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), a validated measurement instrument for the assessment of disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL) has been available internationally since 2000. The aim of this study was to provide a validated German version of this international instrument and to compare it with the German Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15)., <ovid:b>METHODOLOGY</ovid:b>: The CES was translated into German via a forward-backward translation process. For validation, 79 patients with COM undergoing middle ear surgery were prospectively included. HRQoL was determined preoperatively and 6 months postoperatively using the CES and the COMOT-15. Pure tone audiometry was also performed at both measurement time points. In the control examination, an additional retrospective assessment of the preoperative situation was additionally performed using the CES and the COMOT-15 to assess the response shift. The determined psychometric characteristics were internal consistency, test-retest reliability, discrimination validity, agreement validity, responsiveness, and response shift for both measurement instruments. Convergent validity of both measurement instruments was assessed using linear regression., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: On the basis of the CES, patients with COM could be reliably distinguished from patients with healthy ears. The CES showed satisfactory reliability with high internal consistency (Cronbach alpha 0.65-0.85) and high retest reliability (r> 0.8). The global assessment of HRQoL impairment correlated very well with the scores of the CES (r= 0.51). In addition, it showed a high sensitivity to change (standardized response mean -0.86). Compared to the COMOT-15, it showed a lower response shift (effect size -0.17 vs. 0.44). Both measurement instruments correlated only slightly with air conduction hearing threshold (r= 0.29 and r= 0.24, respectively). The concordant validity of both measurement instruments was high (r= 0.68)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The German version of the CES shows satisfactory psychometric characteristics, so that its use can be recommended. The CES focuses on the influence of ear symptoms on HRQoL, whereas the COMOT-15 also includes functional and psychological aspects. Due to only minor response shift effects, the CES is particularly suitable for studies with multiple repeat measurements.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023. The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Cholesteatoma is caused by disorders of the middle ear ventilation that trigger a progressive series of events responsible for its formation. The aim of this study was to identify possible radiological CT-derived parameters predisposing to ventilation disorders and cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In this retrospective study, patients diagnosed with cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media who underwent temporal bone CT and open tympanoplasty surgery have been included, as well as control patients with clinical examination negative for organic otological pathology who underwent temporal bone CT for other reasons. For each patient, the following parameters have been extracted from CT volumes: degree of mastoid pneumatization, prominence of the cog, patency of the Eustachian tube, antrum width, aditus width, anterior and posterior epitympanic widths, and epitympanic height., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixty patients have been included, thirty of whom belonged to the group of patients with cholesteatoma and the remaining part to the group of patients without organic otological pathology. The prevalence of a low degree of mastoid pneumatization was significantly higher among patients with cholesteatoma, as well as for the prevalence of cog prominence (p < 0.001). All the continuous variables were found to have statistical significance (p < 0.05) in the comparison between groups except for the width of the antrum., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Mastoid pneumatization degree, prominence of the cog and epitympanic measures based on temporal bone CT could be good radiological correlates of the ventilatory capabilities of the epitympanum which, if compromised, can facilitate the development of cholesteatoma.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

N2  - BACKGROUND We explored a new method for measuring the length of artificial stapes during stapedotomy in otoendoscopic middle-ear surgery using a flexible ruler. MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted on 56 cases of otosclerosis, comprising 56 ears with a follow-up of over 6 months and complete data. Patients were admitted to the Department of Otology, Huazhong University of Science and Technology Union Shenzhen Hospital from July 2020 to June 2022. SPSS statistical software was used for efficacy analysis. The results of different measurement methods on the implantation time of the prosthesis and postoperative hearing follow-up were compared. RESULTS The 56 patients were randomly divided into 2 groups. In 1 case measured by the metal measuring stick, the prosthesis was too short and was replaced during the operation; 2 patients experienced transient dizziness postoperatively, and the other patients had no surgical complications. All 56 patients had varying degrees of hearing improvement after surgery, and no dislocation of the ossicular chain was observed during the follow-up. There was a statistically significant difference in the implantation time of the prosthesis between the different measurement methods (P<0.05). The improvement in hearing in the flexible ruler group was statistically significant (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS The selection of the length of the ossicular prosthesis is a crucial step in the operation and can directly affect hearing outcomes. The use of a flexible ruler to measure prosthesis length can significantly shorten operation time and improve hearing, and the ruler is easily obtainable. It is worth promoting its application in ear endoscopic stapedotomy.

N2  - <ovid:i>Tenacibaculum maritimum</ovid:i>, the etiological agent of tenacibaculosis in marine fish, constitutively secretes extracellular products (ECPs) in which protein content has not been yet comprehensively studied. In this work, the prevalence of extracellular proteolytic and lipolytic activities related to virulence was analyzed in 64 <ovid:i>T. maritimum</ovid:i> strains belonging to the O1-O4 serotypes. The results showed the existence of a great intra-specific heterogeneity in the enzymatic capacity, particularly within serotype O4. Thus, the secretome of a strain belonging to this serotype was characterized by analyzing the protein content of ECPs and the possible production of outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). Notably, the ECPs of <ovid:i>T. maritimum</ovid:i> SP9.1 contain a large amount of OMVs that were characterized by electron microscopy and purified. Thus, ECPs were divided into soluble (S-ECPs) and insoluble fractions (OMVs), and their protein content was analyzed by a high-throughput proteomic approach. A total of 641 proteins were identified in ECPs including some virulence-related factors, which were mainly found in one of the fractions, either OMVs or S-ECPs. Outer membrane proteins such as TonB-dependent siderophore transporters and the type IX secretion system (T9SS)-related proteins PorP, PorT, and SprA appeared to be mainly associated with OMVs. By contrast, putative virulence factors such as sialidase SiaA, chondroitinase CslA, sphingomyelinase Sph, ceramidase Cer, and collagenase Col were found only in the S-ECPs. These findings clearly demonstrate that <ovid:i>T. maritimum</ovid:i> releases, through surface blebbing, OMVs specifically enriched in TonB-dependent transporters and T9SS proteins. Interestingly, <ovid:i>in vitro</ovid:i> and <ovid:i>in vivo</ovid:i> assays also showed that OMVs could play a key role in virulence by promoting surface adhesion and biofilm formation and maximizing the cytotoxic effects of the ECPs. The characterization of <ovid:i>T. maritimum</ovid:i> secretome provides insights into ECP function and can constitute the basis for future studies aimed to elucidate the full role of OMVs in the pathogenesis of fish tenacibaculosis.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Escribano, Balado, Toranzo, Lemos and Magarinos.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To review the published literature related to the different obliteration and reconstruction techniques in the management of the canal wall down mastoidectomy., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A PubMed (Medline) and LILACS databases as well as crossed references search was performed with the following Mesh terms: "cholesteatoma", "cholesteatoma-middle ear", "otitis media", "otitis media, suppurative", "mastoiditis", "mastoidectomy", "canal wall down mastoidectomy", "radical mastoidectomy", "mastoid obliteration" and crossed references. Inclusion criteria were adult patients subject to mastoid cavity obliteration and posterior canal wall reconstruction. The technique and materials used, anatomic and functional results, complications, recurrence rates, and changes in quality of life, were analyzed. A total of 94 articles were screened, 38 were included for full-text detailed review., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Twenty-one articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Techniques and materials used for canal wall reconstruction, tympanoplasty, and ossiculoplasty were varied and included autologous, biosynthetic, or both. Auditory results were reported in 16 studies and were inconsistent. Three studies reported improvement in the quality of life using the GBI scale. Follow-up time ranged from 1 to 83 months. Eleven articles used imaging studies to evaluate postoperative disease recurrence. The highest recurrence rate reported for cholesteatoma after obliteration was 19%. The most frequently reported complications were retraction pockets and transient otorrhea., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Plenty of techniques combining grafts and other materials have been used to overcome mastoidectomy cavity problems. So far, it is still not possible to standardize an ideal procedure. The available level of evidence for this topic is low and limited.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 PLA General Hospital Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - To compare the anatomic and functional outcomes of the cartilage and temporalis fascia graft materials in type 1 tympanoplasty in paediatric and adolescent population. A total of 55 patients aged <18 years who required type 1 tympanoplasty were selected. 30 patients underwent cartilage palisade tympanoplasty and 25 using temporalis fascia grafts. The age, the side of the operated ear, the operative technique, pre- and post operative pure tone and impedance audiological results, and the status of the graft were noted. Graft was considered taken up if there was successful closure of tympanic membrane perforation. At the end of 6 months, the graft take rate for cartilage was 90% and for temporalis fascia it was 80% (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> > 0.05). ABG closure ratio in cartilage group was 58.54 +/- 23.10% and in temporalis fascia group was 56.46 +/- 27.4% (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> > 0.05). Pre operatively all patients had type B tympanogram in both the groups. While post operatively either type A or C curve was seen in 80% patients of cartilage and 68% patients of temporalis fascia group. Hearing outcomes and graft success rates were high in both fascia and cartilage graft groups but not significantly different.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2017.

N2  - The purpose of the study was to analyze the morphological and functional outcomes in a series of 60 patients for whom Type I tympanoplasty was done using alcohol preserved nasal septal cartilage allograft through endoscopic permeatal route. The study was a prospective, interventional (surgical) study of 60 patients between October 2012 and September 2014. Patients were operated using 0degree, 4 mm, 18 cm long Hopkin's rod endoscope through permeatal route. 70% ethyl alcohol preserved allogeneic nasal septal cartilage with thickness of around 0.5 mm was used for grafting. At the end of 6 months, final assessment of morphological outcome i.e. intact tympanic membrane and functional outcome i.e. reduction in Air Bone gap, was done. At the end of 6 months, 57 patients (95%) had intact tympanic membrane. Mean ABG in postoperative patients was 11.83 dB. The operative time taken in 42 patients (70%) was 30-45 min. 42 patients (70%) returned to normal activity in 3-5 days. Endoscopic cartilage tympanoplasty using allogenic nasal septal cartilage can be safely and effectively used for Type I tympanoplasty with good anatomical and audiological results with benefits of reduced operating time, morbidity, pain and 'No scar'.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Otosclerosis is characterized by bony deposits in the otic capsule, resulting in stapes fixation and progressive hearing loss. It can be treated effectively by surgically removing (part of) the stapes and replacing it with a prosthesis. Increasingly, stapes surgery is performed as a day-case procedure. The major drive towards day-case surgery has been out of economic considerations. However, it is also increasingly an explicit patient request and leads to shorter waiting times for surgery, a reduced risk of infection and most likely positively influences the patient's quality of life as a result of rapid discharge and rehabilitation. Even though stapes surgery seems well suited to a day-case approach, given the low complication rates and early recovery, evidence is scarce and of low quality., <ovid:b>METHODS AND DESIGN</ovid:b>: A single-center unblinded randomized controlled trial was designed to (primarily) investigate the effect of hearing outcomes of day-case stapes surgery compared to inpatient stapes surgery and (secondarily) investigate the effect of both methods on quality of life, tinnitus, vertigo and cost-effectiveness. One hundred and twelve adult otosclerosis patients who are eligible for stapes surgery will be randomly assigned to either the day-case or inpatient treatment group. The primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed using pure-tone audiometry (at approximately 2 months and 1 year follow-up), questionnaires (at 3 months and 1 year follow-up) and costs diaries (weekly the first month after which once a month until 1 year follow-up)., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This trial allows for a comparison between day-case and inpatient stapes surgery to investigate the hypothesis that day-case stapes surgery is associated with a higher quality of life and higher cost-effectiveness, while maintaining equal hearing results, compared to inpatient stapes surgery., <ovid:b>TRIAL REGISTRATION</ovid:b>: Netherlands Trial Register (www.trialregister.nl): NTR4133, registration date 21(st) August 2013.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Given that the temporal bone is one of the most complex regions of the human body, cadaveric dissection of this anatomical area represents the first necessary step for the learning and training of the young oto-surgeon in order to perform middle ear surgery, which includes the management of inflammatory pathology, hearing rehabilitation, and also cognitive decline prevention surgery. The primary objective of this study was to identify common mistakes and critical passages during the initial steps of temporal bone dissection, specifically cortical mastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A survey among 100 ENT residents was conducted, gathering insights into the most prevalent errors encountered during their training to uncover the most challenging aspects faced by novice surgeons during these procedures., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The most common mistakes included opening the dura of the middle cranial fossa (MCF), injury of the sigmoid sinus (SS), chorda tympani (CT), and facial nerve (FN) injury while performing the posterior tympanotomy. The most important critical steps to prevent mistakes are related to the absence of wide exposure during cortical mastoidectomy and the consequent impossibility of identifying the landmarks of the facial recess before performing posterior tympanotomy. Injury of these structures was more common in younger surgeons and in the ones who performed less than five temporal bone dissection courses., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Numerous temporal bone dissections on cadavers are mandatory for ENT residents looking forward to performing middle ear surgery.

N2  - Around 2000 ENT Surgeons perform about 120000 middle ear microsurgery operations annually in India while the burden of otitis media is 50 million cases. A comprehensive questionnaire consisting of personal details of surgeons, his infrastructure, results, and complications was sent to 2000 ENT Surgeons from the latest AOI Directory. 400 Surgeons responded back from all over the country and the data collected was fed into a computer program and was analysed. Most of the responses were from western and southern parts of India. Almost all those who responded were performing myringoplasty while only 47 percent performed ossiculoplasty and 40 percent stapes surgery. Senior surgeons (more than 5 years after post graduation) had better infrastructure and better results as compared to junior surgeons, (less than 5 years). About 60 percent surgeons had Indian operating microscopes (commonest 80 percent being BEL) while 40 percent could afford foreign made microscopes (90 percent being Karl Zeiss). The procedure of myringoplasty is almost standardized while there is need to popularize ossiculoplasty and stupes surgery. Need was felt for technology transfer programmes from Southern and Western parts of India to Northern and Eastern parts of India.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To identify the predictors of anatomical and functional outcomes following tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A retrospective cohort study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) who underwent a tympanoplasty at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019 were retrospectively included. Outcome measures included graft success and postoperative pure tone audiometry air-bone gap (PTA-ABG) at last follow-up (>=6 months). PTA-ABG and MERI were calculated. Descriptive, univariable, and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the predictors of the graft and hearing outcomes., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: During the study, 385 patients (167 male, 218 female, median age 44 years) undergoing 413 procedures were studied. Out of this, 219 ears underwent tympanoplasty, 45 ears had tympanoplasty with canal wall up mastoidectomy, and 149 ears had tympanoplasty with canal wall down mastoidectomy. At the last follow-up, the overall graft success rate was 91.3% (377/413) and the overall hearing success rate was 40% (165/413). Multivariable analysis results showed that the obstructed aditus ad antrum (OR 2.67, 95%CI 1.13-6.30; <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = .025) was an independent prognostic factor for graft failures. Moreover, the obstructed aditus ad antrum (OR 2.18, 95%CI 1.16-4.08; <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = .015) and MERI >3 (OR 6.53, 95%CI 3.55-12.02; <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .001) were independent predictors of hearing failures (PTA-ABG > 20 dB)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Aditus ad antrum patency was an independent predictor of both graft and hearing success among patients following tympanoplasty. MERI score greater than three was found to be a significant predictor of postoperative hearing and could serve as a useful tool for assisting clinicians in perioperative risk assessment., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 4.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 The Authors.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: We surveyed otolaryngology program directors (PDs) and recent otolaryngology residency graduates on the operative autonomy of graduating residents and their comfort with independent practice., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: An anonymous survey was sent to otolaryngology PDs and recent graduates of training programs (members of the Young Physicians Section [YPS] of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation). Questions were developed around the 14 key indicator procedures (KIPs) defined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Fifty PDs (43% of PDs) and 152 recent graduates (6% of YPS members) responded. Over 90% of participating PDs felt their graduating residents were either somewhat or extremely comfortable performing 12 out of 14 KIPs. Among the 12 procedures PDs felt their graduating residents were comfortable performing, 57% to 95% of recent graduates also felt either somewhat or extremely comfortable performing them by graduation. Similarly, at least 90% of responding PDs felt their residents achieved meaningful autonomy in the last 2 months of residency prior to graduation for 11 of 14 KIPs. For these same 11 procedures, 74% to 95% of recent graduates indicated they achieved meaningful autonomy. The procedures that PDs and recent graduates felt required the most surgical assistance were ossiculoplasty/stapedectomy, rhinoplasty, and mastoidectomy. All PDs agreed or strongly agreed that graduating residents are comfortable operating and taking call as general otolaryngologists, compared to 86% and 93% of recent graduates., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Most PDs and recent graduates agree that residents are well-prepared for general otolaryngology practice with the exception of select KIPs.Level of evidence: 4.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 The Authors.

N2  - The aim of the study was to compare anatomical and functional outcomes of temporalis fascia graft versus tragal cartilage graft in type 1 tympanoplasty in paediatric patients. A prospective, comparative and randomised study. A detailed history was taken from all the patients visiting the ENT OP dept after fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criterion patients were enrolled for the study. Written and informed consent was taken for all the patients from legally acceptable guardians. Preoperative assessment was done and the patients were subjected to type1 tympanoplasty with Temporalis fascia graft or tragal cartilage graft. All the patients were followed up on the third, sixth postoperative months to assess hearing improvement. All the patients were followed up on the first and third,sixth postoperative months for graft status with otoscopic examination. In the present study out of 80 patients, 40 patients underwent type 1 tympanoplasty with temporalis fascia and the remaining 40 patients with tragal cartilage. Both groups were assessed postoperatively for anatomical and functional success with maximum follow up of six months. There was no statistical significance between the outcome and the age or site and size of tympanic membrane perforation. Both groups had comparable graft success rate and hearing improvement. The cartilage group had a higher anatomical success rate. The functional outcome was similar. However, there was no statistically significant difference found in the outcome of two groups. Tympanoplasty can be performed in a paediatric age group with a good success rate in suitable patients. It can be done at an early age,safely with good anatomical and functional outcomes. The age group, site or size of perforation, the type of graft used for tympanoplasty does not alter the anatomical or functional outcome significantly., <ovid:b>Supplementary Information</ovid:b>: The online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s12070-023-03490-1.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2023, Springer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.

N2  - Tympanic membrane perforation in children usually appears as a sequel of middle ear infection. This study was conducted to compare the anatomical and functional outcomes of cartilage and temporalis fascia graft in type 1 tympanoplasty in Paediatric population., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: A hospital based randomized controlled trial., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: A tertiary care institute of central India., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS</ovid:b>: All consecutive paediatric patients between 5 and 18 years of either sex attending ENT OPD and Paediatric OPD fulfilling inclusion criteria were included in the study. Anatomical and functional results of total 90 patients who underwent tympanoplasty were analyzed. These patients were divided into two groups depending on the graft material used. The cartilage group and the temporalis fascia group each comprising of 45 patients respectively., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: All patients underwent Type I tympanoplasty under general anaesthesia and with a post auricular approach. The surgeries were performed by senior surgeons. The graft success rate of the cartilage group (91.1%) was higher than the fascia group (84.44%) but the difference was not statistically significant (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = 0.449). The air bone gap closure was slightly better with temporalis fascia group than with cartilage group but the overall functional success rate in both the groups was not statistically significant.Cartilage and fascia grafts yield similar results for hearing gain and graft success rate in paediatric tympanoplasty.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2023, Springer Nature or its licensor (e.g. a society or other partner) holds exclusive rights to this article under a publishing agreement with the author(s) or other rightsholder(s); author self-archiving of the accepted manuscript version of this article is solely governed by the terms of such publishing agreement and applicable law.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The aim of this prospective, randomized-controlled study is to analyze the outcomes of a new graft technique in tympanoplasty and compare its outcomes with cartilage island graft plus extra perichondrium., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A total of 44 patients with noncomplicated chronic otitis media were included in this prospective randomized-controlled clinical trial. Patients were randomly divided into 2 double-layer graft groups: The cartilage island graft + cubism graft (study group) and the cartilage island graft + extra perichondrium (control group). The main outcome measures of the study were the air-bone gap (ABG), ABG gain, and graft status., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Graft success rate was 100% and 95.5% in the study group and the control group, respectively. There were statistically significant differences in the postoperative first month ABG and ABG gain between study and control groups (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .05). ABG and ABG gain showed no significant differences in the postoperative sixth month between groups (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> > .05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study revealed that both graft techniques have satisfactory functional and morphological results compared to preoperative findings. The use of cubism graft with cartilage island graft has significantly better auditory outcomes in short-term and similar results in long-term compared to double-layered cartilage island graft with extra perichondrium. Cubism graft is a highly promising graft technique with its many advantages., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 1b.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 The Authors.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective</ovid:b>: To investigate the effect of day-case stapes surgery on hearing results, quality of life, patient satisfaction, and complications rates, compared with inpatient stapes surgery., <ovid:b>Study Design</ovid:b>: A single-center, nonblinded, randomized controlled trial in a tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: One hundred twelve adult patients planned for primary or revision stapes surgery were randomly assigned to either the day-case or inpatient treatment group. The effect on hearing outcomes (primarily), hearing benefits, quality of life, patient satisfaction, postoperative complications, and causes of crossover or readmission (secondarily) were assessed using auditory evaluations, questionnaires, and patients' charts over a follow-up period of 1 year., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: Audiometric measurements and postoperative success rates were not different between the inpatient and day-case group. There were no statistically significant differences between both groups regarding the overall quality of life (QoL) (HUI3), disease-specific QoL (GHSI), change in postoperative health status (GBI), and postoperative complications rate. We found a high patient satisfaction toward the day-case approach. Six patients allocated to the inpatient group requested same-day discharge. Of the day-case patients, there was a crossover rate to inpatient care of 38% (20 patients), mainly due to postoperative nausea and vomiting (25%), vertigo (20%), or dizziness (40%)., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: We found no significant differences in outcomes of audiometric measurements, QoL, patient satisfaction and postoperative complications following day-case, and inpatient stapes surgery. Therefore, stapes surgery in a day-case setting seems to be a feasible approach in terms of postoperative outcome, safety, and desirability when taking patient selection and surgical planning into account. Besides this, the familiarity with a day-case approach of both patient and the surgical team, will increase the acceptance and feasibility of day-case stapes surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Authors.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: We investigated the effects of the combined administration of nefopam, a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and low dose remifentanil, on early postoperative pain and analgesic requirement., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Fifty patients scheduled to undergo mastoidectomy and tympanoplasty were randomized to be given either nefopam 40 mg mixed with normal saline 100 ml (Group N) or an equal amount of normal saline (Group C) before anesthesia induction. Anesthesia was maintained with 5-6 vol% desflurane and remifentanil 0.05-0.15 microg/kg/min during the surgery. Postoperative pain was controlled by titration of ketorolac in the postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and ward. We evaluated the intraoperative remifentanil dose, recovery profiles, ketorolac demand in the PACU and ward, numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain at time intervals of every 10 min for 1 h in the PACU, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h in a ward, as well as the time to first analgesic requirement in the PACU and ward., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Ketorolac demand and NRS in the PACU were significantly lower in Group N than Group C (P = 0.002, P = 0.005, respectively). The time to first analgesic requirement in the PACU in Group N were significantly longer than Group C (P = 0.046). There were no significant differences in intraoperative remifentanil dose, ketorolac demand, NRS, and the time to first analgesic requirement in the ward between the groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Nefopam administration combined with low dose remifentanil infusion reduces pain and analgesic consumption during the immediate postoperative period in patients undergoing middle ear surgery under desflurane anesthesia.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) application in tympanoplasty procedures for patients with chronic otitis media (COM), assessing its influence on graft survival and healing time., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In this prospective interventional study, conducted between January 2022 and June 2023, 80 patients diagnosed with COM were enrolled and divided into two groups. Group A underwent standard tympanic membrane repair using temporal fascia grafts (TFG), while Group B received TFG with adjunctive PRF application. The patients were observed and assessed over a 20-week postoperative period., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The study showed a significant enhancement in graft survival rates in Group B (TFG+PRF), with only one residual perforation compared to seven in Group A (TFG alone) at 20 weeks (p=0.02534). Furthermore, Group B patients experienced faster healing, achieving 97.5% graft integrity at 10 and 20 weeks, in contrast to Group A's 87.5%., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The application of PRF in tympanoplasty procedures for COM notably enhances graft stability and expedites the healing process. These findings suggest that PRF can be a valuable adjunct in otolaryngological surgeries, offering potential improvements in patient outcomes and surgical efficacy.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Saini et al.

N2  - Grisel's syndrome is an uncommon cervical spine condition marked by non-traumatic rotational subluxation of the atlantoaxial joint. This systematic review aims to collect potential evidence from relevant studies that reported symptoms, diagnostic methods, and management options among pediatric cases of Grisel's syndrome post otolaryngology procedures, which can aid and guide the diagnosis and management in clinical practice. We conducted both electronic and manual search strategies within the potential databases and included case reports, case series, and articles; however, review papers and correspondence papers were excluded. The post-otolaryngology procedures included adenoidectomy, tonsillectomy, tympanoplasty, cochlear implantation, double opposing Z plasty and pharyngeal flap, and adenotonsillectomy. In this systematic review, we identified and analyzed 20 studies encompassing a total of 24 pediatric patients with Grisel's syndrome following otolaryngology procedures. The patient demographics revealed a fairly even distribution between females (45.83%) and males (50.00%), with ages ranging from 2.5 to 12 years. The most common otolaryngology procedures associated with Grisel's syndrome were adenoidectomy (29.17%) and adenotonsillectomy (33.33%). Clinical symptoms included neck pain (75.00%), torticollis (50.00%), and limited neck mobility (20.83%), while diagnostic confirmation primarily relied on CT scans (50.00%). Treatment strategies varied, with conservative measures being the most frequent choice, followed by surgical interventions in four cases (16.67%). Complications were reported in 20.83% of cases. Due to the rarity of this condition, our findings are limited to case reports only, which may limit the generalizability of results. Grisel syndrome can be effectively managed through conservative treatment, including antibiotics and anti-inflammatory drugs if diagnosed timely. Early diagnosis and prompt management are essential to avoid neurological and fatal complications. This analysis would contribute to improving clinical knowledge and treatment strategies while providing additional insights into this rare condition.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2024, Al-Hussain et al.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Hearing loss caused by middle ear malformations is treated by tympanoplasty to reconstruct the acoustic conduction system. The mobility of the ossicles plays a crucial role in postoperative success. However, identifying the location of ossicular malformation based solely on preoperative audiograms is challenging due to the complex relationship between fixation location, deformity levels, and ossicular mobility., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Middle ear finite element models for simulating ossicular malformations were created, and the results were compared with the actual preoperative audiograms., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: This approach objectively diagnosed ossicular fixation and disarticulation, bypassing traditional criteria reliant on physician examination or imaging., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study suggests that future research should focus on developing a diagnostic framework utilizing large-scale data.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective</ovid:b>: Recommendations for air travel after stapes surgery, specifically stapes surgery, vary, with no standard recommendation to guide patients and surgeons. According to our search, no previous article has explored the physics of middle ear changes during flight and its effects on poststapedectomy patients in a systematic way. The aim of this study is to bring together 2 arms of expertise, otology, and aviation, to produce an evidence-based recommendation for flight after stapes surgery., <ovid:b>Data Sources</ovid:b>: The database MEDLINE was searched during August 2022. The search strategy had the goal of identifying studies that discovered the effects of flying on stapes surgery patients and the effects of atmospheric pressure on middle ear structures., <ovid:b>Review Methods</ovid:b>: The articles yielded from the search strategy were transferred to the online citation manager Rayyan. Included in the review were those studies reporting patient outcomes after flying following ear surgery; additional studies included those reporting pressure changes in the middle ear and ossicular chain displacement whether in experimental or animal conditions., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: Modern-day commercial air travel is safe for patients who have undergone stapedotomy surgery, even very shortly after hospital discharge if they have to., <ovid:b>Implications for Practice</ovid:b>: If <ovid:i>stapedotomy</ovid:i> patients wish to fly after hospital discharge, otologists are to reassure them that it is safe to do so. Patients are to be reminded to perform a gentle Valsava maneuver about every 4 minutes during airplane descent.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023 The Authors.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective</ovid:b>: This systematic review aims to describe the impact of otologic surgery as a treatment for chronic otitis media (COM) on the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of adult patients., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science until May 2023. Prospective studies including adult patients with COM (cholesteatoma) who underwent canal wall up mastoidectomy, canal wall down mastoidectomy, or tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy, with pre- and postoperative HRQoL measurements, were considered eligible. Questionnaire validation studies were excluded. The risk of bias and study quality were evaluated with a Quality Assessment Tool (for before-after studies with no control group). To assess the change in HRQoL, pre- and postoperative HRQoL values and absolute changes were extracted, synthesized, and presented in tables. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated to enhance comparisons., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: Of the 720 studies identified, 16 met the inclusion criteria of this review. Different questionnaires were used throughout the studies. The CES and COMOT-15 were used in five studies and the ZCMEI-21 and COMQ-12 in three studies. All studies indicated statistically significant improvement in HRQoL from pre- to postoperative, measured with disease-specific HRQoL questionnaires. General HRQoL questionnaires did not show significant improvement. Calculated SMDs ranged from 0.24 to 6.99., <ovid:b>Discussion and conclusion</ovid:b>: Included studies had low (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 10) to high (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 6) risk of bias and poor (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 4), fair (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 7) or good (<ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 5) study quality. Surgical treatment positively impacts the HRQoL of adult COM patients with and without cholesteatoma. However, the clinical relevance of the reported changes is unknown due to the lack of minimal clinically important differences (MCID) or cut-off values in each questionnaire. Therefore, further research regarding the MCIDs of each questionnaire is needed. Future research should also report preoperative chief symptoms and indications for surgery to improve individual patient counseling.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023 Schouwenaar, Hellingman and Waterval.

N2  - Titanium middle ear (ME) prostheses are widely used in surgical practice due to their acoustic properties. However, they present a significant drawback shared by all synthetic materials currently in use for ME reconstruction: they can be rejected by the organism of the host. In this study, we aim to review the current literature on titanium partial ossicular replacement prostheses (PORPs) and total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORPs) extrusion and dislocation. Eighty articles were analysed after a full article review based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The most common indication for reconstruction was chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma. The average extrusion or dislocation rate was 5.2%, ranging from 0 to 35%. The average improvements in the air-bone gap were 12.1 dB (1.6 dB to 25.1 dB) and 13.8 (-0.5 dB to 22.7 dB) for the PORP and TORP groups, respectively. The data reported on this topic are highly variable, demonstrating that functional outcomes are difficult to predict in clinical practice. We believe that the current limitations could be overcome with technological developments, including bioengineering research focused on promoting prosthesis adaptation to the ME environment.

N2  - Aim of the study was to compare the surgical outcome of endoscopic with microscopic Type 1 tympanoplasty in dry, mucosal type of chronic otitis media with respect to graft uptake rate, hearing gain and duration of surgery. This randomized controlled trial of 3 years was carried out at Tertiary Care Hospital of Central India. Total 80 cases of mucosal type of chronic otitis media posted for Type I tympanoplasty were included in the study. They were randomly divided into two groups viz. Endoscopic tympanoplasty and microscopic tympanoplasty with 40 patients in each group. Chi-square test was used to compare the qualitative results and student's <ovid:i>t</ovid:i>-test was used to compare quantitative results with a level of significance of <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> <= 0.05. Intraoperatively, widening of external auditory canal and auxiliary incision were required in 45% and 47.5% patients of microscopic group respectively. Mean operative time for endoscopic tympanoplasty (62.5 +/-14.94 mins) was less as compared to microscopic tympanoplasty (74.88 +/- 15.83 mins). Graft uptake rate was 95% and 92.5% in endoscopic and microscopic tympanoplasty groups respectively with statistically insignificant difference (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = 0.32). The preoperative mean air bone gap in both the groups was improved significantly 6 months postoperatively. Air bone gap closure was of 13.21+/- 4.37 dB in endoscopic group and 12.54 +/- 4.14 dB in microscopic group with statistically insignificant difference. Endoscope provides superior visualization of hidden areas of middle ear cavity and has shorter operative time than microscopic tympanoplasty with comparable surgical and functional outcomes. hence endoscopic tympanoplasty can be a good option to microscopic surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2021.

N2  - This systematic review aims to (a) define what instruments are available to measure quality of life (QoL) in patients undergoing tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media (COM) and what is the most commonly selected timing to do so; (b) compare outcomes from different surgical techniques; and (c) describe any reported correlation between subjective and functional results. This review was conducted following the PRISMA statement recommendations. Of the 151 articles screened, 24 were included. Most studies had a prospective design. The mean age at surgery was 44.5 years. A microscopic retroauricular approach was the most common surgical technique. Most articles included both primary and revision surgeries. The most commonly used questionnaire was the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), followed by the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), the Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15) and the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21). Questionnaires were administered about 12 months after surgery in most studies. Ten studies reported possible associations between hearing results and QoL. QoL assessment after COM surgery variably relies on disease-specific and non-specific questionnaires. Patients are usually evaluated 12 months after surgery, and this appears to be a suitable timing to contrast the possible bias effect of different tympanoplasty techniques associated with different healing times. A comparison between QoL outcomes in different surgical approaches cannot be made, as several influencing factors have not been detailed in the included studies. Few studies have investigated the correlation between subjective and objective outcomes of tympanoplasty for COM so far.

N2  - This review article aims to scrutinize the studies conducted to determine a relationship between preoperative Middle Ear Risk Index (MERI) factors and postoperative graft acceptance and audiological gain in patients undergoing tympanoplasty procedures in middle ear surgeries. Critical analysis is done on numerous research and types of studies that were done in this area during the past years. The clinical and technical aspects connected to disease and its care have a variety of effects on the morphological and functional outcome of tympanoplasty. A better comprehension of these characteristics aids in better disease prognostication, surgical planning, and patient counseling. At the end of this review, we can conclude that the MERI score is inversely proportional to the post-operative graft acceptance and audiological gain. The accumulated MERI is hence a good prognostic factor for the hearing outcome of surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022, Dash et al.

N2  - <ovid:b>Introduction</ovid:b>: Few studies evaluated the treatment of postoperative pain in middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>Materials and Methods</ovid:b>: We conducted a randomized clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of dexamethasone in the management of postoperative pain in middle ear surgery. Group G1 received an intravenous injection of 2 ml of physiological saline 30 minutes before the end of the procedure. Group G2 received a 2 ml intravenous solution containing 8 mg of dexamethasone, 30 minutes before the end of the procedure. Pain perception was measured by the Visual analog scale (VAS) every 10 min during the first hour and then every 6 hours during the 24 hours postoperatively. The delay of the first analgesic demand and the consumption of analgesics use during the first 24 hours postoperatively, were recorded., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: VAS values were lower in G2at all measurement points during the first hour, as well as the first 24h postoperatively (Mann-Whitney test, P<0.05). The delay of the analgesic request was (0 (0-60) for G1 versus 0 (0-80) for G2, P=0.04, Mann-Whitney test). Morphine was used in 44% of the patients in G1 against 19% for G2 (P = 0.031). There was a significant difference between G1 and G2 in terms of the total dose of morphine consumed (P= 0.028, Mann-Whitney test). Paracetamol demand was lower in group 2 at all points of assessment during the first 24 hours postoperatively., <ovid:b>Conclusions</ovid:b>: Intravenous dexamethasone is effective in decreasing pain and analgesic requirement, during the first 24 hours postoperatively, in patients undergoing middle ear surgery.

N2  - <ovid:i>Background.</ovid:i> The treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma requires surgical treatment and the reconstruction of the temporal bone, which represents an ongoing problem. Otologists have focused on the research of materials allowing an airy middle ear and the preservation of hearing function to reconstruct the temporal bone. <ovid:i>Methods.</ovid:i> This study evaluated the effect of cyclosporin A (CsA) and a combined biomaterial in the healing process of postoperative temporal bone defects in an animal model. Cultured human Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (hBM-MSCs) were mixed with hydroxyapatite (Cem-Ostetic<ovid:sup> R</ovid:sup>), and subsequently applied as a bone substitute after middle ear surgery, showing that the therapeutic potential of hBM-MSCs associated with bone regeneration and replacement is directly influenced by CsA, confirming that it promotes the survival of MSCs in vivo. <ovid:i>Results.</ovid:i> The therapeutic efficacy of the combination of MSCs with CsA is greater than the sole application of MSCs in a hydroxyapatite carrier. <ovid:i>Conclusion.</ovid:i> The reconstruction of a temporal bone defect using hBM-MSCs requires an immunosuppressant to improve the results of treatment.

N2  - <ovid:b>Purpose</ovid:b>: To compare cartilage tympanoplasty (CT) combined with eustachian tube balloon dilatation (ETBD) and cartilage tympanoplasty alone as a surgical treatment modality for adhesive otitis media (AdOM) in terms of graft healing, audiological outcomes, and impact on life style, using Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15)., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: 50 patients with AdOM were randomly classified into 2 groups: 25 patients for cartilage tympanoplasty only (CT group) and 25 patients for cartilage tympanoplasty combined with eustachian tube balloon dilatation (CT + ETBD group). Clinical outcomes in both groups were compared at 3 and 6 months of follow up., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: There was no significant difference in graft healing between the two groups. Postoperative COMOT-15 scores significantly decreased in both groups with a significant difference between the groups with regard to the decrease in COMOT-15 scores at 3 and 6 months of follow-up (P < 0.05). Hearing improvement was achieved, as the mean preoperative ABG was 26.5 +/- 5.4 and 27.1 +/- 4.6 dB, and the mean postoperative ABG at 6 months was 19.4 +/- 4.4 and 14.6 +/- 3.9 dB in the CT and the CT + ETBD groups, respectively. The difference in the magnitude of ABG reduction in the two groups was significant at 3 and 6 months of postoperative follow-up (P < 0.05) in favour of the CT + ETBD group., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: ETBD can increase the success rate of cartilage tympanoplasty in patients with AdOM by enhancing the audiological outcome and quality of life.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 PLA General Hospital Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - Chronic Otitis Media (COM) is a major indication for tympanoplasty. It is important to predict the outcome of surgery and give proper counselling for the patient. This avoids untoward expectations. To measure the outcome of patients who underwent tympanoplasty for mucosal type of chronic otitis media (COM) using Middle ear risk index (MERI) score. Any possible correlation of MERI score with outcomes? Assess quality-of-life. Prospective analytical comparative cohort study. Sample size was 75. All patients underwent tympanoplasty for mucosal type of COM with hearing loss. The patients were categorised into mild, moderate and severe groups based on the MERI score. The hearing benefit was calculated from the pre- and post-op difference in PTA. The graft uptake status was graded. The relation between MERI score, graft status and hearing benefit were analysed and compared. QOL was assessed by COMOT-15 questionnaire. Patients with a high MERI score had lower rate of graft uptake, whereas, patients with mild MERI had greater hearing benefit and those with severe MERI had lesser hearing benefit postoperative. MERI score is a prognostic tool to predict the outcome of tympanoplasty. It has an inverse relation with graft uptake and hearing benefit. Based on MERI score, the chances for surgical success and hearing benefit could be explained to the patient to give them realistic expectations.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2020.

N2  - Tympanoplasty is a commonly performed surgical procedure done by Otorhinolaryngologist for treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media. Postoperative period requires the use of analgesics which are given regularly. The study aims to assess the efficacy of a single dose of preemptive pregabalin in decreasing postoperative pain after postauricular type 1 tympanoplasty. This randomized prospective study was carried out in a tertiary care hospital between July 2017 and April 2018. A total of 60 patients were divided into two groups of 30 each. This study analyzed the effect of single preoperative use of pregabalin 150 mg oral 1 h before type 1 postauricular tympanoplasty for postoperative pain as a VAS (visual analogue scale) score and requirement of rescue analgesia and results were compared with the placebo group. Pain scores (VAS score) was significantly lower in the pregabalin group as compared to the placebo group at 6, 12, 24, and at 48 h. Rescue analgesia requirements were also lower in the pregabalin group than the placebo group. Preemptive use of a single dose of oral 150 mg pregabalin reduces postoperative pain and rescue analgesic requirement in patients undergoing type 1 tympanoplasty.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2020.

N2  - To observe and compare the functional outcome in term of hearing gain in ossiculoplasty with autologous incus and Teflon made TORP/PORP in cases of chronic otitis media (COM) with ossicular disruption. 60 patients of COM between age of 11-50 years who had ossicular disruption were included in the study. They were divided into two groups of 30 patients/ group: group 1 included those patients who had mucosal COM and group 2 included those who had squamous COM. They were further subdivided into 3 subgroups each as per the ossiculoplasty material used. Pre-operative pure tone audiometry (PTA) was done. They all were followed-up at 3 months after surgery and at that time PTA was done. Pre-and post-operative hearing was compared and hearing improvement was calculated in term of air-bone gap (ABG). Out of 60 cases, 16 cases marked as failure of ossicular reconstruction as post-operative A-B gap was > 30 dB. Among these 16 cases, 7 were those patients whom ossiculoplasty was done using autologous incus and in rest 9 patients PORP/TORP was used. Success rate of ossiculoplasty using refashioned incus was 76.66% whereas Teflon TORP/PORP had success rate of 70.00%. We conclude that hearing improvement after ossiculoplasty with autologous incus is better as compare with that obtained by Teflon TORP/PORP. Also, it is a cost-effective method.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2020.

N2  - Endoscopes are presently used as an adjunct to microscopic surgery for better visualization of hidden areas of middle ear or they are used as a primary modality replacing the microscopes. We performed primary endoscopic ear surgery at a tertiary care center to evaluate the scope of endoscopic ear surgeries and to evaluate the anatomical, functional and quality of life outcomes. We evaluated 103 cases of which included patients with chronic otitis media mucosal disease (64), chronic otitis media squamous disease (29), otosclerosis (6), and benign ear tumors (4). In our study, the structural and functional outcomes of endoscopic ear surgeries were comparable to microscopic techniques however it conferred superior patient related outcomes of cosmesis, post-operative pain and early return to daily routine. Thus endoscopic ear surgery is a minimally invasive alternative option to microscopic techniques in the field of otology.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Association of Otolaryngologists of India 2020.

N2  - To compare the efficacy between the commonly used sealing materials, i.e., adipose tissue and the gelfoam in primary endoscopic stapedotomy. Lobular fat and gelfoam have been used in patients who underwent endoscopic stapedotomy between two groups, each containing 29 patients. The hearing outcomes and postoperative complications were compared at the end of 12 weeks between two groups. The ABG of <= 10 dB was achieved in 69% of cases in group A and 76% of cases in group B. There was a significant short-term (1 week) improvement in the Dizziness Handicap Inventory score (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = 00) with patients of adipose tissue seal compared to the gelfoam. Although the audiological outcomes were comparable between the two groups, the use of the adipose tissue can be a better alternative than gelfoam to control vertigo in the early postoperative period without causing any significant morbidity to the patient.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2020.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective</ovid:b>: To systematically review the results of inlay cartilage butterfly tympanoplasty and standard underlay temporal fascia tympanoplasty for anatomic and functional end points., <ovid:b>Data Sources</ovid:b>: PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and Virtual Health Library (VHL/Lilacs) databases were searched from inception through April 2, 2021. No restrictions on language, publication year, or publication status were applied., <ovid:b>Review Methods</ovid:b>: The meta-analysis included data from articles that met inclusion criteria and were extracted by 2 authors independently. The PRISMA statement was followed. Risk of Bias 2.0 and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale were used to assess risk of bias. The primary outcome was tympanic membrane closure rate. The secondary outcome was improvement of the air-bone gap., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: Ten studies were included, 9 cohort studies and 1 randomized clinical trial, with 577 patients. The graft take rate was 82.8% in the butterfly cartilage inlay tympanoplasty group and 85.2% in the temporal fascia underlay tympanoplasty group (relative risk, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.93-1.11; <ovid:i>I</ovid:i> <ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 42%, <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = .08). The air-bone gap reduction ranged from 6.1 to 11.28 in the butterfly cartilage inlay group and from 5.2 to 12.66 in the temporal fascia underlay group, with a mean difference between groups of -2.08 (95% CI, -3.23 to -0.94; <ovid:i>I</ovid:i> <ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> = 58%, <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = .04), favoring temporal fascia underlay., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: The 2 tympanoplasty techniques analyzed here produced similar results in terms of successful reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and reduction in the air-bone gap.

N2  - Eustachian tube dilation (ETD) is an established, minimally invasive therapeutic approach for chronic eustachian tube dysfunction. The complications associated with performing a ETD are rare. A 22-year-old female patient presented with chronic otitis media on the right side and chronic obstructive tube dilation disorder on both sides. A type I tympanoplasty was performed on the right side because of a tympanic membrane perforation after a ETD on both sides without apparent complications. On the 5th postoperative day, she presented with headache, dizziness and hearing loss on the right side. There was a decrease of hearing threshold on the right side in the pure-tone audiogram and vHIT, cVEMP, and SVV were irregular. The <ovid:i>beta</ovid:i>-2-transferrin test was positive. Since a right-sided perilymph fistula was suspected, an emergency tympanotomy was performed with a round window membrane cover with fascia on the right side. Intraoperatively, a regular, intact ossicular chain was found with a slightly moist middle ear mucosa. The round window membrane was covered by the promontorial lip. Under these measures, the patient's dizziness regressed. The right ear pure-tone threshold vHIT, cVEMP, and SVV normalized.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 R. Kim et al.

N2  - Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) may limit communication, which is closely associated with cognitive decline of the elderly and negatively affects their quality of life. In ARHL patients who suffer chronic otitis media (COM), hearing impairment may worsen and negatively affect the cognition and quality of life. It is currently unknown whether restoration of the conductive hearing in the mixed hearing loss through middle ear surgeries can improve both the cognitive function and quality of life of the ARHL patients. Therefore, in the present study, the ARHL patients were followed up for 6 months after middle ear surgeries for COM, and both the cognitive functions and quality of life of the patients were assessed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Glasgow Benefit Inventory. It was found that both the cognitive functions and quality of life were improved 6 months after middle ear surgeries. In conclusion, hearing recovery after middle ear surgeries could improve cognitive functions and quality of life of ARHL patients with COM, and surgical intervention is, hence, recommended for COM.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Gao, Chen, Xu, Liang and Yi.

N2  - A long-term, retrospective, non-controlled study was performed on the drainage results of mastoidectomy (both radical and modified radical) and the relevant statistical factors that could influence the anatomic outcome were defined. The present study took into consideration the same cohort of 200 patients we have communicated with before in our previous studies concerning the long-term functional results of mastoidectomy and long-term results of ossicular replacement with biovitroceramic prosthesis. The patients were clinically followed for the same period of 8.12 years. The drainage (anatomic) results, similar to previously published functional results, were defined by analytical function of the severity and the period of evolution of disease. The main goal was to define the situations and factors (presence of complications, type of disease, type of tympanic perforation or status of ossicular chain) that influenced the drainage results that could provide us with some type of anatomical prognosis. The follow-up started at the moment of complete epithelization for each cavity as time represents the main study comparison criteria. Drainage failure was assessed by the number of otorrhea episodes. It was concluded that practically and ideally, a maximum of 84% of the mastoid and petrous cells can be cleaned out. The results of 78% drainage success are congruent to this theory. The remaining 16% of cells may contain irreversible lesions.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright: &#xa9; Mocanu et al.

N2  - In the clinical setting, the pathophysiology of sensorineural hearing loss is poorly defined and there are currently no diagnostic tests available to differentiate between subtypes. This often leaves patients with generalized treatment options such as steroids, hearing aids, or cochlear implantation. The gold standard for localizing disease is direct biopsy or imaging of the affected tissue; however, the inaccessibility and fragility of the cochlea make these techniques difficult. Thus, the establishment of an indirect biopsy, a sampling of inner fluids, is needed to advance inner ear diagnostics and allow for the development of novel therapeutics for inner ear disease. A promising source is perilymph, an inner ear liquid that bathes multiple structures critical to sound transduction. Intraoperative perilymph sampling via the round window membrane of the cochlea has been successfully used to profile the proteome, metabolome, and transcriptome of the inner ear and is a potential source of biomarker discovery. Despite its potential to provide insight into inner ear pathologies, human perilymph sampling continues to be controversial and is currently performed only in conjunction with a planned procedure where the inner ear is opened. Here, we review the safety of procedures in which the inner ear is opened, highlight studies where perilymph analysis has advanced our knowledge of inner ear diseases, and finally propose that perilymph sampling could be done as a stand-alone procedure, thereby advancing our ability to accurately classify sensorineural hearing loss.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This study was conducted to evaluate the user satisfaction, efficacy, and safety of round window (RW) vibroplasty using the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) in patients with persistent mixed hearing loss after mastoidectomy., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The study included 27 patients (mean age, 58.7 years; age range, 28-76 years; 11 men and 16 women) with mixed hearing loss after mastoidectomy from 15 tertiary referral centers in Korea. The VSB was implanted at the RW. The Korean translation of the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) questionnaire and the Korean version of the International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids (K-IOI-HA) questionnaire were used to evaluate user satisfaction as the primary outcome. The secondary outcome measures were audiological test results and complication rates., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The mean scores for ease of communication (61.3% to 29.7% to 30.2%), reverberation (62.1% to 43.1% to 37.4%), and background noise (63.3% to 37.7% to 34.3%) subscales of the APHAB questionnaire significantly decreased after VSB surgery. The mean K-IOI-HA scores at 3 and 6 months after surgery were significantly higher than the mean preoperative score (18.6 to 27.2 to 28.1). The postoperative VSB-aided thresholds were significantly lower than the preoperative unaided and hearing aid (HA)-aided thresholds. There was no significant difference between preoperative unaided, preoperative HA-aided, and postoperative VSB-aided maximum phonetically balanced word-recognition scores. None of the 27 patients experienced a change in postoperative bone conduction pure tone average. One patient developed temporary facial palsy and two developed surgical wound infections., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: RW vibroplasty resulted in improved satisfaction and audiological test results in patients with mixed hearing loss after mastoidectomy, and the complication rate was tolerable.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Recognition of the anatomical course of the chorda tympani nerve (CTN) is important for preventing iatrogenic injuries during middle-ear surgery., <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: This study aims to compare visualization of the CTN using two computed tomography (CT) methods: conventional high-resolution CT (C-HRCT) and ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT)., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: We performed a retrospective visual assessment of 59 CTNs in normal temporal bones of 54 consecutive patients who underwent both C-HRCT and U-HRCT. After dividing CTN into three anatomical segments (posterior canaliculus, tympanic segment, and anterior canaliculus), two neuroradiologists scored the visualizations on a four-point scale., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: On C-HRCT, the visual scores of the posterior canaliculus, tympanic segment, and anterior canaliculus were 3.5 +/- 0.7, 1.6 +/- 0.6, and 3.1 +/- 0.7, respectively. The respective values were significantly higher in all segments on U-HRCT: 3.9 +/- 0.2, 2.4 +/- 0.6, 3.5 +/- 0.6 (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.01). Although the difference in scores between methods was greatest for the tympanic segment, the visual score on U-HRCT was lower for the tympanic segment than for the anterior and posterior segments (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.01)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Ultra-high-resolution CT provides superior visualization of the CTN, especially the tympanic segment.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2021.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: In days of scar less surgeries it has become necessary for otologists to concentrate on tympanoplasties without external incisions. This study compares the anatomical and functional results of tragal perichondrium graft and perichondrium-cartilage composite graft for transcanal endoscopic tympanoplasties in Himalayan region., <ovid:b>METHODS AND MATERIALS</ovid:b>: This prospective study included 60 subjects of chronic otitis media (mucosal type), who underwent transcanal endoscopic underlay type I tympanoplasty and were divided into two groups. In 30 cases tragal perichondrium graft and in rest of 30 cases Tragal perichondrium Cartilage composite graft was used. Anatomical and functional outcomes were evaluated at 6 months time., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Hearing gain comparing Audiometric data between the tragal perichondrial graft group and tragal perichondrial cartilage composite graft group at 6 months showed no statistically significant differences (P= 0.9533). Assessment of anatomical outcome indicated a greater number of complications in the tragal perichondrial graft group although it was not statistically significant (P=0.6360 in anterior graft failure group, P =0.1322 in reperforation group and P= 0.1056 in retraction group)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Functional results validated both the grafting material while anatomical results are slightly better in tragal perichondrial cartilage composite graft group in term of re perforation and retraction. Moreover use of tragal grafts endoscopic tympanoplasty fulfils its true meaning as no visible scar and post operative patient morbidity is prevented.

N2  - Perforation is the most common illness of the tympanic membrane (TM), which is commonly treated with surgical procedures. The success rate of the treatment could be improved by novel bioengineering approaches. In fact, a successful restoration of a damaged TM needs a supporting biomaterial or scaffold able to meet mechano-acoustic properties similar to those of the native TM, along with optimal biocompatibility. Traditionally, a large number of biological-based materials, including paper, silk, Gelfoam<ovid:sup> R</ovid:sup>, hyaluronic acid, collagen, and chitosan, have been used for TM repair. A novel biopolymer with promising features for tissue engineering applications is cellulose. It is a highly biocompatible, mechanically and chemically strong polysaccharide, abundant in the environment, with the ability to promote cellular growth and differentiation. Bacterial cellulose (BC), in particular, is produced by microorganisms as a nanofibrous three-dimensional structure of highly pure cellulose, which has thus become a popular graft material for wound healing due to a number of remarkable properties, such as water retention, elasticity, mechanical strength, thermal stability, and transparency. This review paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current experimental studies of BC, focusing on the application of BC patches in the treatment of TM perforations. In addition, computational approaches to model cellulose and TM are summarized, with the aim to synergize the available tools toward the best design and exploitation of BC patches and scaffolds for TM repair and regeneration.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Azimi, Milazzo and Danti.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Majority of petrous bone and lateral skull base pathologies are benign in nature. The complex anatomy usually warrants an extensive approach with associated morbidity., <ovid:b>CASE SUMMARY</ovid:b>: Two cases of petrous bone cholesteatoma (1 congenital cholesteatoma with facial palsy and 1 acquired cholesteatoma) and a case of glomus tympanicum were treated with exclusive endoscopic transcanal approach. The cases of petrous cholesteatoma were addressed with trans-promontorial and infra-cochlear approaches. The mean operative time was approximately 140 min. No CSF otorrhoea was noticed in the post-operative period. The average period of hospital stay was 3.7 days., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In the subset of cases with limited benign disease an endoscopic trans-canal approach is a better alternative to an external approach. It decreases operative time, blood loss, chance of meningitis, morbidity and hospital stay. The lack of depth perception is a major hurdle which can be come over by experience in endoscopic middle ear surgery. This approach can create direct access to cochlea/petrous apex/internal auditory canal (IAC)/Supra-geniculate ganglion region.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 PLA General Hospital Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess hyperacusis after stapedotomy and its possible influencing factors., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective, interventional, and longitudinal study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: A tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Fifty consecutive patients (35 females, mean age = 46.8 years)., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: All patients underwent stapedotomy. The validated Portuguese version of the "Hyperacusis Questionnaire" (HQ) was administered before and two weeks and one month after surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: No hyperacusis was reported by any patient before surgery. At two weeks after surgery, all patients experienced hyperacusis, with a mean HQ at 16.88 +/- 6.54 (range 4-25). One month after surgery, hyperacusis had already resolved in most patients. Gender, preoperative presentation or surgeon had no influence on HQ scores (p > 0.05). Patients with previous contralateral stapedotomy showed lower HQ scores (p = 0.001). Audiological parameters improvement measured at one month after surgery (PTA, SRT and contralateral SRT) were associated with HQ higher scores., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study confirms that hyperacusis is a common complaint after stapedotomy that usually resolves in one month after surgery. The HQ highest scores were registered among patients with the highest audiological gain after surgery. This suggests that hyperacusis may be a positive prognostic factor for audiological success after stapedotomy.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 PLA General Hospital Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The aim of this paper is to review how successful each type of grafts is in tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Pubmed, Google and the Proquest Central Database at Kirikkale University were queried using the keywords "graft", "success" "tympanoplasty", "success rate" with the search limited to the period 1955 to 2017., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Various types of graft materials including temporalis fascia, cartilage, perichondrium, periosteum, vein, fat or skin have been used in the reconstruction of tympanic membrane (TM) perforation. Although temporalis fascia ensures good hearing is restored, there are significant concerns that its dimensional stability characteristics may lead to residual perforation, especially where large TM perforations are involved. The "palisade cartilage" and "cartilage island" techniques have been stated to increase the strength and stability of a tympanic graft, but they may result in a less functional outcome in terms of restoring hearing. Smoking habits, the size and site of a perforation, the expertise level of the operating surgeon, age, gender, the status of the middle ear mucosa and the presence of myringosclerosis or tympanosclerosis are all important in determining how successful a graft is., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Although temporal fascia is the most commonly used graft material for tympanoplasty, poor graft stability may cause failure. This failure is due to the inclusion of connective fibrous tissue containing irregular elastic fibers present in the grafted fascia. Cartilage grafts offer better ability to resist infection, pressure, and cope with insufficient vascular supply. This means that cartilage grafts are suitable for use in revision cases.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 PLA General Hospital Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Stapes surgery is technically challenging, yet its methodology is not standardized. We aim to elucidate preferences in stapes surgery among American Otological Society (AOS) otologists and determine if any common practice patterns exist., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Cross-sectional study via emailed questionnaire., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Surgery centers., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Members of the AOS were an emailed a survey to quantify variables including surgical volume, anesthetic preference, laser use, type of procedure, footplate sealing technique, antibiotic use, and trainee participation., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Most otologists (71%) performed 2 to 5 stapes surgeries per month under general anesthesia (69%) with stapedotomy (71%) as the preferred procedure. Most (56%) used the rosette method of laser stapedotomy with manual pick debris removal for footplate fenestration. Either the handheld potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser (40%) or handheld carbon dioxide (CO<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub>) laser (33%) was used. The heat-activated memory hook (51%) was the preferred prosthesis. Footplate sealing method was variable, as was antibiotic use among respondents. Trainee participation was limited, as 42% of otologists allowed residents to place the prosthesis, and fewer allowed residents to crimp the prosthesis, and laser or drill the footplate. Surgeons with higher surgical volume (>= 6 surgeries per month) demonstrated the following statistically significant correlations: footplate fenestration with laser in a rosette pattern and pick for debris removal (<ovid:i>r</ovid:i> <ovid:sub><ovid:i>s</ovid:i></ovid:sub> = -0.365, <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = 0.014) and trainee participation with fellows only (<ovid:i>r</ovid:i> <ovid:sub><ovid:i>s</ovid:i></ovid:sub> = 0.341, <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = 0.022)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Trends in various surgical decisions showed a lack of consensus in all aspects of stapes surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 The Authors.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to translate the Chronic Otitis Media Benefit Inventory (COMBI) into Turkish and evaluate the questionnaire's reliability in assessing benefit outcomes in patients after ear surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A total of 30 patients with chronic otitis media who underwent ear surgery were asked to fill out the translated Turkish version of the COMBI questionnaire six months after their surgery twice, 10 days apart. The patients were divided into two groups in two different ways based on surgical and audiological outcomes. These were surgical success (SS), surgical failure (SF), audiological success (AS), audiological failure (AF) groups. Student's -<ovid:i>t</ovid:i> test was performed to show the differences in the COMBI scores of the groups. Cronbach's alpha value was calculated to test internal consistency, Pearson's correlation coefficient was measured to demonstrate test-retest reliability and factor analysis was run., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The average score of the SS group was 51.08 and significantly higher than the score of the SF group (42.40) (p=0.012). There was, however, no statistically significant difference between the average scores of the AS and the AF groups (p=0.330). A Cronbach's alpha value of 0.862 was found. Pearson's r value was calculated 0.810. Factor analysis showed that a three-factor solution explained the 70.2% of the variance., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The Turkish version of the COMBI is a valid test with high test-retest reliability. It should be used with objective assessment tools for better understanding how patients benefit from the surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> &#xa9; Copyright 2020 by Official Journal of the Turkish Society of Otorhinolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> To summarize the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with chronic suppurative otitis media who underwent type I tympanoplasty, and to analyze for the first time the efficacy of type Itympanoplasty in elderly patients from multiple perspectives of medical data and patient evaluation, so as to provide reference for doctors and patients to make rational decisions on treatment methods. <ovid:b>Methods:</ovid:b> Forty-four elderly patients(45 ears) who underwent type Itympanoplasty from May 2016 to February 2022 were retrospectively analyzed, and were followed up for 6 months to 3 years. To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients, summarize the success rate of graft, and compare the hearing level of patients before and after surgery. The patients' quality of life before and after operation was evaluated by Chronic Ear Survey, and the scores obtained were statistically analyzed. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> Of the 44 patients(45 ears), 22.22%(10/45) of the ears had predisposing factors. The percentage of hearing loss, ear pus and tinnitus were 91.11%(41/45), 88.89%(40/45) and 42.22%(19/45), respectively. Mixed deafness accounted for 55.56%(25/45). 66.67%(30/45) patients were diagnosed as tympanosclerosis by operation. The graft success rate was 97.78%. There was no significant difference in bone conduction hearing threshold before and after surgery, but there was significant difference in air conduction hearing threshold and air bone conduction difference. The scores of "activity restriction", "symptom", "medical resource utilization" and their total scores of the preoperative and postoperative were statistically different. Hypertension or diabetes had no significant effect on the efficacy of type I tympanoplasty in elderly patients. <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> Type Itympanoplasty is safe and effective in elderly patients, and the quality of life of patients after surgery is significantly improved. It is necessary to increase the awareness of elderly patients to seek medical advice and use surgical methods reasonably to treat chronic suppurative otitis media.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright&#xa9; by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The chorda tympani nerve (CTN) is a mixed nerve, which carries sensory and parasympathetic fibres. The sensory component supplies the taste sensation of the anterior two-thirds of the ipsilateral side of the tongue. During middle ear surgery the CTN is exposed and frequently stretched or sacrificed, because it lacks a bony covering as it passes through the middle ear. Injury may cause hypogeusia, ageusia or altered taste sensation of the ipsilateral side of the tongue. To date, there is no consensus regarding which type of CTN injury (sacrificing or stretching), during middle ear surgery, leads to the least burden for the patient., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A double-blind prospective prognostic association study was designed in a single medical centre in the Netherlands to determine the effect of CTN injury on postoperative taste disturbance and quality of life. 154 patients, who will undergo primary stapes surgery or cochlear implantation will be included. The taste sensation, food preferences and quality of life of these patients will be evaluated preoperatively and at one week, six weeks and six months postoperatively using the Taste Strip Test, Electrogustometry, supplementary questionnaire on taste disturbance, Macronutrient and Taste Preference Ranking Task, Appetite, Hunger and Sensory Perception questionnaire and Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders to assess the association of these outcomes with CTN injury. Evaluation of olfactory function will only take place preoperatively and at one week postoperatively using the Sniffin' Sticks. The patient and outcome assessor are blinded to the presence or absence of CTN injury., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION</ovid:b>: This study is the first to validate and quantify the effect of chorda tympani nerve injury on taste function. The findings of this study may lead to evidence-based proof of the effect of chorda tympani injury on taste function with consequences for surgical strategies., <ovid:b>TRIAL REGISTRATION</ovid:b>: Netherlands Trial Register NL9791.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess the rate of dilatory (chronic obstructive) eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) in adult patients scheduled for surgery for chronic inflammatory middle ear disease., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: We included adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease (chronic suppurative otitis media, adhesive otitis media [middle ear atelectasis], cholesteatoma). We excluded patients with pathologies that do not stem from ETD (e.g., noninflammatory chronic middle ear disease [e.g., otosclerosis], tumors, solely external auditory canal conditions), patients scheduled for implantable electronic hearing devices independent of disease, patients with otitis media with effusion and scheduled paracentesis or ventilation tubes only, patients with previous radiotherapy or previous balloon eustachian tuboplasty, and children and patients unable to complete questionnaires., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: We evaluated ETD with Valsalva maneuver and in case of negative or unclear Valsalva with the eustachian tube score (ETS). A negative Valsalva maneuver and an ETS score of 5 or lower were used to define dilatory (chronic obstructive) ETD., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Rate of ETD in the included patients., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: From a total of 482 consecutive patients, 350 patients had positive Valsalva maneuver or ETS score higher than 5. From the 193 patients with negative or unclear Valsalva maneuver, 77 patients had an ETS score of 5 or lower, and 55 rejected further diagnostics with ETS., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Based on a large cohort of adult patients with chronic inflammatory middle ear disease scheduled for middle ear surgery, the majority (82%) seems to have no dilatory (chronic obstructive) ETD that can be detected with current routine clinical methods and tubomanometry. Common pathophysiological explanations should be questioned critically, especially in the context of communication with patients.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023 The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Endoscopic type I tympanoplasty was originally introduced in the 1990s and the extensive spread of this practice can be easily observed. The conventional technique performed involves the repair of a tympanic membrane perforation and is defined as microscopic type I tympanoplasty. The aim of this study is the comparison of quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes with endoscopic to that with microscopic type I tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: All patients, or in the case of children with the aid of a parent, were asked to complete a novel QoL questionnaire drafted by our study group. The analysis was performed with descriptive statistics-mean, SD and relative frequency-and with a mixed model (generalized least squares fit). A two-sided p value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 83 patients completed the questionnaire, 38 in the endoscopic group and 45 in the microscopic group. Every question represented a different. A statistically significant result was found in favor of the endoscopic approach regarding average hospitalization rate (p = 0.003) and cosmetic outcomes (p = 0.015). No statistically significant difference was otherwise observed between the groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Based on our prospective cohort study, the QoL outcomes of endoscopic type I tympanoplasty in terms of postoperative pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, taste disorder and hearing were comparable to the microscopic type I tympanoplasty. In regard to cosmetics, an increase in desirable results was achieved in the endoscopic group, particularly the average hospitalization rate proved to be statistically significantly lower than in the microscopic group.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The objective of this study was to evaluate the utility of a caprine model in endoscopic ear surgical education using the index procedures of tympanoplasty and ossiculoplasty. Specifically, this study assessed the face and content validity of the caprine model, and the potential impact of anatomical differences on trainee understanding of human middle ear anatomy., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Twelve otolaryngology trainees attended a 3-hour endoscopic ear surgery course utilizing the caprine model in which they completed canalplasty, tympanoplasty, and ossiculoplasty. Prior to the course, the trainees completed a self-reported needs assessment and knowledge assessment of human middle ear anatomy. Following the course, the trainees repeated the knowledge assessment and completed evaluation and validation questionnaires. Five-point Likert scores were used for the needs assessment and validation questionnaire., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of the 12 trainees, 9 participated in the study. All domains of the learner needs assessment showed an average improvement of 1 point on the post-course evaluation with 6 of 9 domains being significantly improved using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test (P< .05). The model achieved validation in the domains of face, content, and global content validity with an average Likert score > 4. Knowledge assessment scores increased by 7% (P=.23) after the course compared to before., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The caprine model offers an effective surgical simulation model for endoscopic ear surgery training with good face and content validity. We find it to be readily available and affordable. We currently use it routinely to give otolaryngology residents the experience of endoscopic ear surgery before operating on patients.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The surgical treatment of otosclerosis consists of the replacement of the stapes using a piston., <ovid:b>AIMS/OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The objective of this study is to assess the audiometric results and quality of life (QOL) of patients who underwent surgery for otosclerosis by stapedectomy with fascia interposition (STIP) or by stapedotomy using CO<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> laser (SLaser) without fascia interposition., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Ninety-one patients operated on for otosclerosis by STIP (40 patients) and by SLaser (51 patients) were included. Audiometric results were graphically displayed using the Amsterdam Hearing Evaluation Plot and were compared to the Common Otology Database (COD) comprising 660 patients. The patients' QOL was assessed with an otological validated survey. The significance level was <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .05., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There was no significant difference in hearing improvement between SLaser and STIP-operated patients. There was no significant difference between our results and that of COD. QOL was significantly improved (+3.5/10) postoperatively for both STIP and SLaser in both social and professional fields., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE</ovid:b>: By comparing QOL and hearing gain of STIP and SLaser, our results suggest that both surgical techniques are a safe and successful treatment for otosclerotic stapes fixation. Further studies aiming at comparing larger series may confirm and refine these results.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Unstable cavities are defined as cavities with cerumen accumulation that need frequent cavity cleaning in the out-patient clinic, cavities that are intolerant to water due to risk of infection or that are subject to frequent infection and otorrhoea. The objective of this study is to address the problem of troublesome mastoid cavities, with the performance of secondary mastoid obliteration and canal wall reconstruction, using a novel posterior auricular artery (PAA) fascia-periosteum flap., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A prospective study was designed, only secondary obliterations were included. Unstable mastoid cavities were defined as Merchant grade 2 or 3 and were included for surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: At 12 months of follow up, a complete external auditory canal (EAC) and a self-cleaning ear were achieved in all 23 patients. Completely dry ears were achieved in 21 patients (91.3%). An air-bone gap improvement of 5dB was achieved., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Mastoid obliteration and EAC reconstruction are effective procedures to treat troublesome post canal wall down mastoid cavities. They improve quality of life and enable patients to overcome ear discharge. A standard EAC size enables the utilization of conventional hearing aids, it also reduces the need for constant mastoid cleaning and decreases healthcare expenses. The PAA flap seems to be an effective procedure to achieve all these features, as it is used to obliterate the mastoid and becomes a structural component of the neo-EAC.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Sociedad Espanola de Otorrinolaringologia y Cirugia de Cabeza y Cuello.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Obstructive eustachian tube dysfunction is a common pathology, generally accepted as the underlying cause for chronic ear diseases. Eustachian tube dilation has shown promising results in randomized controlled trials, but is a costly procedure. The aim of the current study was to assess the feasibility of transnasal balloon dilatation of the eustachian tube with an endovascular balloon in the context of ease of use, maneuverability, and safety., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Clinical pilot study carried out at a university tertiary care facility. In total, twelve patients, were included over a period of 6 months. All patients underwent tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy surgeries. Eustachian tube dilation was carried out transnasal using an endovascular balloon. A computed tomography was carried out after surgery to assess for any potential damages and compared to preoperative imaging studies. Postoperative endoscopy was performed intraoperatively and at follow up to assess for any potential damages., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All eustachian tube dilations were carried out successfully. No severe adverse events were noted during the procedure, in the postoperative period, or on imaging studies. Minor adverse events such as mild intraoperative bleeding was managed in a routine fashion., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Balloon dilation of the eustachian tube with the endovascular balloon was feasible and safe in all cases. It is likely a more cost-effective alternative to commercially available balloons with similar designs and specifications. Trial registration The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov; NCT04809753, initial release February 24th, 2021.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023. The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study aimed to characterize self-reported postoperative pain after tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy and correlate pain severity with the patient's preoperative anxiety state., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective cohort study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral medical center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Adult patients undergoing any middle ear surgery between July 2018 and July 2019., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Patient responses to an otology questionnaire (OQ) for scoring pain intensity on a visual analog scale preoperatively and on postoperative days (PODs) 1-4, 21, and 63. The responses were correlated with anxiety state (assessed by State-Trait Personality Inventory [STPI] scores) and clinical and operative data, including surgical technique-related details., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixty patients were enrolled (mean age +/- standard deviation, 40 +/- 19.7 yr, 26 men). Their median preoperative (baseline) visual analog scale pain score was 6 on POD1, 5 on POD3, and 1 at 3 and 7 weeks. Their median preoperative OQ score was 32 of 70 (45.7%), 37 of 70 (52.8%) on POD1, 33 of 70 (47.1%) on POD3, 6 of 70 (8.5%) at 3 weeks, and 6 of 70 at 7 weeks. Their overall mean preoperative anxiety level (STPI score) was 2.63 +/- 1.50. STPI scores were significantly higher among patients who reported OQ scores equal to or higher than the median during PODs 1 to 4 in comparison to patients who reported OQ scores lower than the median. The alpha Cronbach correlation between anxiety and postoperative pain scores on POD1 was 0.97., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Preoperative anxiety levels are closely associated with postoperative pain levels after any middle ear surgery. Measures to control preoperative anxiety are warranted to alleviate postoperative pain.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Progressive adherent pars tensa occasionally induces ossicular erosion. Specifically, stapes discontinuity adversely affects postoperative hearing. However, this irretrievable sequela is challenging to prove preoperatively, partly because perimatrix inflammation on the pars tensa can obscure the visibility of the ossicles or the partial volume effect of computed tomography (CT) imaging can hamper detailed ossicular visualization. Therefore, there is no consensus regarding the ideal timing for switching from a wait-and-see approach to a surgical one. Herein, we aimed to explore the potential predictors of stapes superstructure destruction in adherent pars tensa., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This retrospective cohort study enrolled consecutive patients who underwent primary tympanoplasty for adherent pars tensa categorized as grade IV on Sade's grading scale between April 2016 and September 2021. The impact of features on otoscopy and CT and air-bone gap (ABG) on stapes superstructure destruction was assessed using uni- and multivariable logistic regression analyses., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixty-four ears were included. Multivariate analysis revealed the presence of debris on the adherent pars tensa (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval {CI}]): 4.799 [1.063-21.668], p = 0.0415), presence of soft-tissue density occupying the oval window (OR [95% CI]: 13.876 [3.084-62.437], p = 0.0006), and a >= 20-dB preoperative ABG at 3 kHz (OR [95% CI]: 7.595 [1.596-36.132], p = 0.0108) as independent predictors for stapes superstructure destruction., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: High preoperative awareness of the possibility of destruction of the stapes superstructure would enable the surgeon to make a timely decision to provide surgical intervention before progression to severe stapes destruction, thereby maintaining long-term satisfactory hearing.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: The objectives of the present clinical trial are to describe our surgical technique for advanced tympanosclerosis (TS) and to present the comparison of pre-and postoperative audiometric results., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: 21 patients suffering from advanced TS (Only type III and IV patients according to Wielinga-Kerr classification) were enrolled in this prospective study. A pure transcanal endoscopic approach was preferred for all patients included in the study. Titanium malleus replacement prosthesis (MRP) and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) loop prosthesis combination were used to bypass fixed ossicles to achieve sound transmission to the inner ear. Pre-and postoperative pure tone audiometry (PTA) measurements and air-bone gap (ABG) results compared, and surgical technique was considered successful if postoperative ABG was less than 20 dB., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Six of the 21 patients had been operated on before and the tympanic membrane (TM) was intact. The remaining 15 of the 21 patients were the primary cases, and TM perforation repair and ossiculoplasty using combination of the MRP and PTFE loop prosthesis were performed at single-staged operation. The average preoperative ABG values significantly improved from 37.1 +/- 6.2 to 14.5 +/- 1.2 dB postoperatively (p < 0.001). The mean preoperative air conduction threshold (ACT) significantly decreased from 51.7 +/- 11.4 to 28.5 +/- 9.1 dB (p < 0.001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: TS surgery is still a controversial issue particularly in stapes footplate fixation. However, our surgical and audiological results in this study are quite promising. The combination of titanium MRP and PTFE loop prosthesis for restoring sound transmission in advanced TS cases is reliable, effective and novel treatment option via endoscopic transcanal approach.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

N2  - <ovid:i>Background and <ovid:br/>Objectives </ovid:i>: Non-autologous graft materials hold promise for tympanic membrane (TM) perforation closure. In the present manuscript, we aimed to evaluate the influence of clinical and surgical (i.e., graft materials) characteristics on tympanoplasty outcome in chronic otitis media (COM). <ovid:i>Materials and Methods</ovid:i>: We retrospectively reviewed clinical and surgical characteristics of COM patients with TM perforation treated with tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy. Univariate and multivariate appropriate tests were applied. <ovid:i>Results</ovid:i>: We used xenograft (porcine submucosal collagen) in 163 patients, and temporalis fascia in 210. The mean follow-up time was 37.2 months. Postoperative TM perforation (i.e., negative outcome) was detected in 11.6% of cases with xenograft, and in 12.8% with temporalis fascia. Performing uni- and multivariate analysis, we determined that large (three or all quadrants) TM perforation (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = 0.04) and moderate-to-severe intraoperative bleeding (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = 0.03) were independent prognostic factors of negative outcome. Considering the 197 patients with moderate-to-severe intraoperative bleeding, we disclosed that the use of temporalis fascia (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = 0.03) was an independent risk factor of postoperative TM perforation. <ovid:i>Conclusions</ovid:i>: According to our results, large TM perforation and moderate-to-severe intraoperative bleeding were independent prognostic factors of negative outcome in adult COM patients treated with tympanoplasty. In the sub-group of COM patients with excessive intraoperative bleeding, use of temporalis fascia was associated with negative outcome; these patients could benefit from xenograft materials. These findings should be tested in large randomized clinical trials.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Patients with otitis media (OM) encounter significant functional hearing impairment with conductive, or a combined hearing loss and long-term sequelae involving impaired speech/language development in children, reduced academic achievement and irreversible disorders of middle and inner ear requiring a long time therapy and/or multiple surgeries. In its persistent chronic form, Otitis media (COM) can often only be treated by undergoing ear surgery for hearing restoration. The persistent inflammatory reaction plays a major role, often caused by multi-resistant pathogens in the ear. Herein, we present outcomes of patients implanted with currently the only FDA approved active Middle Ear Implant Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB), suffering from persistent COM., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The study enrolled 42 patients, treated by performing middle ear (ME) surgery to different extents and implanted with the VSB to various structures in the ME. Included were 17 children and 25 adults that had recurrent and/or persisting OM and significant hearing loss. Preoperative and postoperative patients' audiometric data were evaluated and the benefit with VSB assessed using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory for adults and pediatric cohorts. The microbial spectrum of pathogens was assessed before and after surgery, exploring the colonization of the otopathogens, as well as the intestinal microbiome from individually burdened patients., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The mean functional gain is 29.7 dB HL (range from 10 to 56.2 dB HL) with a significant improvement in speech intelligibility in quiet. Following VSB implantation, no significant differences in coupling were observed at low complication rates. Postoperatively patients showed significantly increased benefit with VSB compared to the untreated situation, including less otorrhea, pain, medical visits, and medication intake, with no recurrent OM and significant bacterial shift in otopathogens. The analysis of the intestinal microbiome displayed a high abundance of bacterial strains that might be linked to chronic and persistent inflammation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Functional ear surgery including rehabilitation with a VSB in patients suffering from COM present to be safe and effective. The successful acceptance accompanied by the improved audiological performance resulted in significant benefit with VSB, with a shift in the ear pathogens and altered microbiome and thus is a great opportunity to be treated.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2023.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: The main determinant in deciding on stapes surgery in patients with otosclerosis is the degree of hearing loss, specifically the size of the preoperative air-bone gap (ABG). The debate over the minimum ABG centers on the risk-to-benefit ratio of stapes surgery in patients with small ABG (sABG). The aim of this study was to measure the audiological outcomes and self-assessed satisfaction in a group of otosclerosis patients with an sABG who underwent stapedotomy., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: There were 83 patients with preoperative sABG <=25 dB HL (mean of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 Hz) included in this study. Audiometry was performed before surgery and 6 months and 12-36 months after surgery. Self-reported patient outcomes before and after surgery were collected using questionnaires., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: At the 6-month follow-up, the ABG was closed within 10 dB in 63 (78.8%) cases. Preoperatively, tinnitus was present in 70% of patients, of which 66% reported that tinnitus was a moderate or severe problem. Postoperatively, 71% of patients experienced a significant reduction in tinnitus severity and 34% of them reported complete disappearance. The self-report outcomes relating to quality of life and hearing reflected a good level of satisfaction in most patients., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The possibility of reducing bothersome tinnitus after stapes surgery, and thus improving the patient's quality of life, should be taken into account when making a decision on stapes surgery in these patients.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 S.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Congenital cholesteatoma (CC) is accompanied by hearing loss and an intact tympanic membrane. However, the hearing loss is usually associated with otitis media, and the diagnosis of CC is frequently delayed in patients with an intact tympanic membrane. This study aimed to describe the clinical characteristics, management and outcomes of patients with CC., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We reviewed patients with cholesteatoma from January 2011 to May 2020 and selected those meeting the congenital cholesteatoma criteria. The primary outcome measures included presenting symptoms, surgical findings, stage of disease, recurrence rate and hearing outcomes., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: We reviewed 1646 medical files of cholesteatoma patients and identified 18 patients with congenital cholesteatoma, the mean age at operation was 8.13 +/- 1.36 years (range 3-18). The unilateral hearing loss included moderate 13 patients (72.2%), severe 4 patients (22.2%), and slight 1 (5.6%). There were 14 cases of conductive hearing loss (77.8%) and 4 cases of mixed hearing loss (22.2%). The mean course of disease was 1.41 +/- 0.05 years (range 0.4-3). The surgical management was oto-endoscope exploratory tympanotomy in 1(5.6%), canal wall up mastoidectomy in 12 (66.7%) and canal wall down in 5 (27.8%), with 17 (94.4%) ossicular replacements. Seventeen (94.4%) patients presented with Potsic stage III-IV. Recurrence occurred in 5.6% of patients in stage III and 11.1% of patients in stage IV. After surgery, patients achieved normal voice tone hearing., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: To diagnose it early, congenital cholesteatoma should be considered as a possible aetiology for hearing loss patients with an intact tympanic membrane. In our study, most patients were diagnosed at III and IV stage. This highlights the need to promote awareness of the disease among primary physicians in the community healthcare system. Surgical management with removal of the cholesteatoma and reconstruction of the tympanum and ossicular chain is an effective treatment.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022.

N2  - Hemin has attracted considerable interest as an efficient catalyst recently, however, its direct application is inefficient due to severe molecular aggregation. Immobilizing hemin on various supports is a feasible approach to address this issue. In this work, a CNTs-hemin catalyst was prepared by loading hemin onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through ball milling. Compared with hemin, CNTs-hemin demonstrates remarkably enhanced performance in the peroxymonosulfate system, with a 650-fold improvement of apparent rate constant, reaching 97.8% degradation of sulfathiazole in 5 min. High-valent iron-oxo porphyrin cation ((Porp)<ovid:sup>+*</ovid:sup>Fe<ovid:sup>IV</ovid:sup>=O) radicals are proposed as the dominant reactive species in the CNTs-hemin/peroxymonosulfate system instead of sulfate radicals (SO<ovid:sub>4</ovid:sub><ovid:sup>*-</ovid:sup>), hydroxyl radicals (*OH), superoxide radicals (O<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub><ovid:sup>*-</ovid:sup>) and singlet oxygen (<ovid:sup>1</ovid:sup>O<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub>). More in-depth mechanisms reveal that the strong electron transfer between CNTs and hemin promotes the generation of (Porp)<ovid:sup>+*</ovid:sup>Fe<ovid:sup>IV</ovid:sup>=O radicals through a heterolysis pathway. This research enriches the understanding of the catalytic mechanism of supported biomimetic catalysts for PMS activation and provides a perspective on the role of support materials for catalytic activity.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To compare hearing results and complication rates between two groups of patients operated on by endoscopic stapes surgery (ESS) for otosclerosis, either with CO<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> fiber laser or microdrill., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A case-control study was performed. All consecutive cases of CO<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> fiber laser ESS operated at a single center during the period 2017-2020 (case group) were matched to a control group of patients operated by traditional technique, according to year of surgery, preoperative mean air-bone gap, sex and age. Audiological data from preoperative and postoperative examinations and complication rates were compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 46 cases were included. Mean operative time was significantly longer in the laser cohort (65 min) than in the drill one (45 min) (p = 0.003). Similar results were found in the two groups regarding the mean postoperative BC-PTA. The high-frequency bone conduction resulted significantly higher in the laser group (p = 0.002), suggesting an overclosure effect in the laser group. Consistently, a significant improvement of the BC-PTA threshold at 2000 Hz postoperatively was found in the laser group (p = 0.034). The postoperative AC-PTA significantly improved in both groups at all frequencies (p < 0.05), except for the AC threshold at 8 kHz. Similar rates of complications were found in the two groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study is the first to compare hearing results and complications between CO<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> fiber laser and microdrill in ESS. Our results demonstrated similar functional outcomes between the two groups, confirming ESS as safe and effective, regardless of the technique used.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: The aim of the study was to investigate hearing outcomes in stapes revision surgery with regard to the type of clinic (university clinic or county clinic). Furthermore, the aim was to investigate the risk of complications with a focus on tinnitus, hearing deterioration, and taste disturbance 1 year after surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The study is based on data from the Swedish Quality Register for Otosclerosis Surgery (SQOS). Two study protocols were completed by the surgeon, and a questionnaire was distributed to the patients 1 year after surgery. A total of 156 revisions were available for analysis with both preoperative and postoperative audiometry data., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Seventy-five percent of the patients reported better to much better hearing 1 year after revision surgery. An air bone gap <= 20 dB postoperatively was seen in 77% of the patients. Four percent had hearing deterioration >= 20 dB PTA<ovid:sub>4</ovid:sub> AC. Eleven percent had worsened or newly developed tinnitus, 5% had taste disturbance, and 3% had dizziness 1 year after surgery. Preoperative and postoperative hearing did not differ between patients operated on in university vs. county clinics., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Revision surgery in otosclerosis is a challenge for otologists, but no differences in hearing outcomes between university and county clinics were found in this nationwide study. The risk of hearing deterioration and deafness is higher than in primary stapes surgery, and revision surgery should be recommended primarily in cases with a large air-bone gap and moderate to severe preoperative hearing loss.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques in predicting air-bone gap after tympanoplasty compared with conventional scoring models and to identify the influential factors., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We reviewed the charts of 105 patients (114 ears) with chronic otitis media who underwent tympanoplasty. Two numerical scoring systems (middle ear risk index [MERI] and ossiculoplasty outcome parameter staging [OOPS]) and three algorithms (random forest [RF], support vector machine [SVM], and k nearest neighbor [kNN]) were created. Experimental variables included age, preoperative air-bone gap, soft-tissue density lesion in the tympanic cavity in CT, otorrhea, surgical history, ossicular bone problems in CT, tympanic perforation location, perforation type (central or marginal), grafting material, smoking history, endoscopy use, and the operator whose experience was 20 years or longer, or shorter. Binary classification, postoperative air-bone gap <=15 or >15 dB, and multiclass classification, classification into seven categories by 10 dB, were performed, and the percentages of correct prediction were calculated. The importance of features in the RF model was calculated to identify influential factors., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The percentages of correct prediction in binary classification were 62.3%, 72.8%, 81.5%, 81.5%, and 81.5% in MERI, OOPS, RF, SVM, and kNN, respectively, and those in multiclass classification were 29.8%, 21.9%, 63.1%, 44.7%, and 50% in the same order. The RF model suggested larger preoperative air-bone gap, and older age could make the postoperative air-bone gap larger., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The machine learning techniques, especially the RF model, are promising methods for precise postoperative air-bone gap prediction., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 4 Laryngoscope, 133:2371-2378, 2023.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare measured and perceived taste function before and after surgery of patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma (OMCC) to patients without cholesteatoma (patients with chronic suppurative otitis media [CSOM] and patients with lateral skull base lesions [LSB])., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This prospective cohort study included 29 patients undergoing surgery for unilateral OMCC. The chorda tympani nerve (CTN) was resected in 8 of these patients. Fourteen patients undergoing surgery for unilateral CSOM and 5 patients undergoing surgery for unilateral LSB (with CTN resection) served as the comparison group. Taste function was measured using taste strips on both sides of the tongue before surgery, 2 weeks postoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. The affected side of the tongue was compared to the unaffected side. A questionnaire on taste perception was completed at each visit., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Preoperatively, cholesteatoma patients showed higher taste strip scores than non-cholesteatoma patients, indicating a larger difference between the healthy and affected sides of the tongue. Despite this difference in measured taste function few cholesteatoma patients reported taste alteration before surgery (3/29 [10.3%]). Postoperatively, patients with CTN resection (OMCC patients with CTN resection and LSB patients) showed a decreased measured taste function. Subjectively, only approximately 20% of these patients reported taste alteration 3 months postoperatively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Before surgery, cholesteatoma patients displayed an impaired measured taste function compared to patients without cholesteatoma (CSOM, LSB). Subjectively this was often unnoticed. After surgery, despite removal of the CTN and consequent reduction of measured taste function, few patients reported taste alteration and subjective taste perception was seen to be improving. In regards to middle ear surgery, perceived taste function does not seem to reflect measured gustatory function.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) injury between endoscopic and microscopic stapes surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This randomized controlled clinical trial included 88 patients who were randomly divided into two groups: endoscopic stapedotomy group (n = 44) and microscopic stapedotomy group (n = 44). The incidence of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) injury after surgery was determined by both subjective taste testing and chemical taste tests, before and after surgery. The results were compared between the two groups., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The total number of patients who were identified as having CTN affection (based on the chemical testing) was 16 out of 88 (18.2%). The incidence was significantly lower in the endoscopic group (n = 2) than the microscopic group (n = 14) (p = 0.019)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Altered taste as a result of iatrogenic CTN injury can affect the patients' quality of life. Endoscopic ear surgery offers better visualization, less need for extensive manipulation of the chorda tympani, and consequently decreased incidence of CTN injury.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Access to and utilization of perioperative healthcare may influence outcomes in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM); however, the influencing factors are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to assess the association of sociodemographic factors with perioperative health care utilization for pediatric CSOM patients., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We conducted a review on pediatric CSOM patients (<=18 years old) who underwent tympanoplasty with/without mastoidectomy between 2010 and 2020. Sociodemographic data and clinical were collected on all participants. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between these factors and perioperative care utilization., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 427 patients were included in the study. The primary factor associated with health care utilization was insurance status. Rural children were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (p = 0.048). For tympanoplasty patients, Medicaid patients have 1.66 higher odds of pre-operative no-shows (p = 0.01), 1.31 higher odds of post-operative no-shows (p = 0.02), and 59% lower odds of having a postoperative audiogram (p = 0.01), and 2.64 higher odds of being from a rural community (p = 0.02). For patients undergoing mastoidectomy, Medicaid patients have 1.25 higher odds of postoperative no-shows (p = 0.01), 39% lower odds of having a revision procedure for ossicular reconstruction (p = 0.045). Appalachian rural mastoidectomy patients had 3.62 higher odds of having cholesteatoma (p = 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Pediatric patients with CSOM who have Medicaid insurance, especially those who reside in rural regions, are at risk for lower perioperative hearing health care utilization. As these findings may impact care delivery and clinical outcomes, efforts should be focused on promoting utilization among these populations., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 4 Laryngoscope, 133:700-705, 2023.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare functional outcome of microscopic and endoscopic approach regarding type of ossiculoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In this retrospective study, cases who had undergone type-II and type-III tympanoplasty between February 2007 to September 2019 were divided into two groups according to the type of approach as microscopic and endoscopic. In cases with type-II reconstruction; Partial Ossicular chain Replacement Prosthesis (PORP), incus interposition and bone cement were used in order of frequency. Whereas in cases with type-III reconstruction, only Total Ossicular chain Replacement Prosthesis (TORP) was used. The average Air Bone Gap (ABG) was determined pre- and post-operatively for the calculation of Air Conductance Gain (ACG). The ACG, pre- and post-operative ABG values of each group were compared with regard to the type of ossiculoplasty., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 79 cases consisting of 32 females and 47 males who had undergone type-II and type-III tympanoplasty were enrolled. No statistically significant difference between microscopic and endoscopic approach was found in terms of ACG (p=0.42), pre-(p=0.23) and postoperative ABG (p=0.99). We did not find any significant difference in terms of ACG, pre- and postoperative ABG between two approaches for type-II and type-III reconstructions (p>0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: According to the current study, endoscopic approach in type-II and type-III reconstruction is at least reliable as microscopic approach regarding functional outcome. Since both techniques have similar functional results, other factors (anatomic characteristics, habitude of the surgeon and duration of the surgery) should be considered when choosing the technique., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: In the current paper we present a retrospective comparative study of two different approaches of a particular type of otologic surgery. Level of evidence corresponds to level III.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial. Published by Elsevier Espana, S.L.U.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Management of tympanic membrane perforations is varied. This study aimed to better understand current practice patterns in myringoplasty and type 1 tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: An electronic questionnaire was distributed to American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery members. Practice patterns were compared in terms of fellowship training, practice length, practice setting, paediatric case frequency and total cases per year., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of the 321 respondents, most were comprehensive otolaryngologists (60.4 per cent), in private practice (60.8 per cent), with a primarily adult practice (59.8 per cent). Fellowship training was the factor most associated with significant variations in management, including pre-operative antibiotic usage (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = 0.019), contraindications (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.001), approach to traumatic perforations (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.001), use of local anaesthesia (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.001), graft material (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.001), tympanoplasty technique (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = 0.003), endoscopic assistance (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.001) and timing of post-operative audiology evaluation (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = 0.003)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Subspecialty training appears to be the main variable associated with significant differences in peri-operative decision-making for surgical repair of tympanic membrane perforations.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Training in surgical specialties has declined during the COVID-19 pandemic. A study was carried out to further analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on specific aspects of clinical, training, and research activities performed by the otolaryngology residents in Spain., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A cross-sectional qualitative study was conducted during the last two weeks of February 2021. The study consisted of an online survey taken by otolaryngology residents who had undertaken one-year continuing training from February 15, 2020, to February 15, 2021, and consisted of 26 questions exploring the impact of the COVID-19 on the health of the ENT residents and training activities. Categorical variables were reported as frequency and percentage. When indicated, Pearson's Chi-square test (chi2) with Yates's correction and Pearson's correlation coefficient (r) were used., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 143 completed surveys were received from 264 Residents (54.17%). 36 residents (25.2%) have suffered from the disease due to SARS-CoV-2. Most of them only developed mild symptoms (86.1%), with 3 requiring hospitalisation (8.3%). The origin of infection was unknown in all reported cases and the need for confinement was principally due to either attending an asymptomatic patient in 9 cases (6.3%) or to being supposedly in close contact with an asymptomatic person in 22 (15.4%). 60.1% of the residents surveyed reported having lost more than 6 months of their training period, and in 18.8% of cases, it was as high as 10 and 12 months. There has been a reduction of more than 75% of what was planned in surgical training (p<0.05) of tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy, stapedectomy, cochlear implants, endoscopic sinonasal and anterior skull base surgery, septoplasty and turbinoplasty., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The decline in ENT activity and residents having to assist in other COVID-19 units during the most critical moments of the pandemic, has caused the main reduction in their training capacity. Contagion mainly occurred through contact with asymptomatic carriers during patient care and through supposedly close contact with asymptomatic carriers. Virtual activities have been widely accepted, but they have not completely replaced all residents' training needs. Measures should be implemented to recover lost training, especially surgical practical learning in otology and rhinology.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Sociedad Espanola de Otorrinolaringologia y Cirugia de Cabeza y Cuello.

N2  - <ovid:b>Background</ovid:b>: Septoplasty, endoscopic sinus surgery, and tympanoplasty are the most commonly performed elective functional ear-nose-throat surgeries. Aim: This study investigated the relationship between preoperative anxiety, bruxism, and postoperative pain in inpatient groups undergoing three different functional otorhinolaryngologic surgeries. Patients and., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: This study was conducted in a single center of a tertiary referral hospital. The patients (n = 90) who had undergone septoplasty (group A), endoscopic sinus surgery (group B), and tympanoplasty (group C) were included. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaire and the Amsterdam Preoperative Anxiety Information Scale (APAIS) were administered. To evaluate bruxism, a self-questionnaire was administered, and for the evaluation of pain, the visual analogue scale (VAS) was administered., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: In group C, preoperative STAI and APAIS and early and late pain values were higher than in the other groups. When patients were divided into two groups according to the presence of bruxism. A significant difference was found between the preoperative STAI and immediate and late VAS values (P < 0.001). A strong correlation was observed between APAIS and early and late VAS values in group C (P < 0.001)., <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b>: Patients who will undergo tympanoplasty should be aware of the preoperative anxiety level and pain follow-up. Bruxism can be considered a vital follow-up parameter that manifests due to high preoperative anxiety. It may also be useful to examine preoperative bruxism and take appropriate measures due to its pain-increasing effect in patients.

N2  - The aim of this study - to investigate the practice of stapes surgery in Russia using a special questionnaire (Appendix 1). Thirty-three questionnaires were sent to specialists dealing with stapes surgery in various Russian medical institutions. Responses were received from all ENT specialists, of whom 75.7% use stapedotomy as a technique. In most cases, colleagues perform more than 30 operations per year, there were also reports of performing about 100 operations per year and in one case 370 operations annually. 45.5% of respondents preferred a combination of general and local anesthesia for stapes surgery. According to the results of the survey, the titanium K-piston prosthesis is most frequently used. Analysis of the survey results showed that to date there is no unanimous opinion concerning some aspects of stapes surgery; however, in many issues the approaches of Russian surgeons coincide with the general world trends.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To assess the impact of race and ethnicity on 30-day complications after tympanoplasty surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for tympanoplasty procedures from 2005 to 2019. Demographic, comorbidity, and postoperative complication data were compared according to race using univariate and binary logistic regression analyses., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 11,701 patients were included, consisting of 80.3% White, 3.0% Black, 7.7% Asian, 5.7% Hispanic, 2.5% American Indian/Alaska Native, and 0.8% other. Binary logistic regression model indicated that Black patients had increased odds of unplanned readmittance (p = 0.033; odds ratio [OR], 3.110) and deep surgical site infections (p = 0.008; OR, 6.292). American Indian/Alaska Native patients had increased odds of reoperation (p = 0.022; OR, 6.343), superficial surgical site infections (p < 0.001; OR, 5.503), urinary tract infections (p < 0.001; OR, 18.559), surgical complications (p < 0.001; OR, 3.820), medical complications (p = 0.001; OR, 10.126), and overall complications (p < 0.001; OR, 4.545)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Although Black and American Indian/Alaskan Native patients were more likely to have complications after tympanoplasty surgery after adjusting for comorbidities, age, and sex, these results are tempered by an overall low rate of complications. Future studies should be devoted to understanding the drivers of these health inequities in access to otologic care and surgical treatment to improve outcomes and achieve equitable care.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - BACKGROUND This paper presents a case of a 15-year-old child with a rare congenital anomaly of the middle ear in which the stapes was fused to the medial wall of the tympanic cavity. CASE REPORT This defect coexisted with partial malleus fixation in the attic and caused conductive hearing loss at an average level of 35-40 dB. Two exploratory tympanotomies were performed, where excess bone between the stapes and promontory was removed and the head of the malleus was released in the attic. The good effect of these procedures was unstable, mainly due to re-attachment of the stapes to the medial wall of the tympanic cavity. At the next surgery it was decided to perform stapedotomy, despite the mobile stapes footplate. The operation was performed with a small-fenestra stapedotomy technique. Perforation of the footplate was done using a microdrill with a balanced speed. A KURZ prosthesis with a diameter of 0.5 mm was used. The postoperative period passed without any complications. Three and 6 months after the surgery, control pure tone audiometry was performed and showed significant improvement in hearing thresholds. During the follow-up period of more than 6 months, hearing improvement remained stable. CONCLUSIONS We concluded that it was safe to perform stapedotomy in the presence of a mobile stapes footplate when congenital anomaly of the stapes superstructure caused its severe fixation in the middle ear. In our opinion, in a child with congenital ear anomaly, consideration should be given to the multifocal origin of the hearing loss.

N2  - This case study describes a 72-year-old female with a history of stapedectomy 40 years prior. She presented experiencing vertigo, fogginess, and imbalance for 9 months. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed that the prosthesis was displaced into the vestibule by approximately 2.1 to 2.4 mm. The patient was presented with treatment options, including observation, removal, replacement of the prosthesis, and an oval window patch. The patient opted for observation as the symptoms she was experiencing did not significantly impact her quality of life. Although a stapedectomy may fail for a multitude of reasons, some of the most common causes are prosthesis displacement, especially out of the oval window into the middle ear or away from the incus. Incus necrosis may also play a substantial role in failure.

Further analysis of those not ordering routine CT to determine whether imaging would be ordered for previous ear surgery, vestibular complaints, childhood hearing loss, AR inconsistent with otosclerosis, possible advanced otosclerosis, or atypical complaints, including autophony. Further subgroup analysis based on years in practice and practice setting (private versus academic)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Most respondents (56.5%) had practiced more than 15 years and worked in academic settings (69.4%). Rates of routine use of preoperative AR, vestibular evoked myogenic potential, and electrocochleography were 80, 4.7, and 0%, respectively. There were no significant differences based on time in practice or practice settings. For CT, 35.3% reported routine use with a statistically significant difference between academic and private practice respondents (42.4% versus 19.2%, p = 0.040). For CT contingent on specific clinical factors, only AR inconsistent with otosclerosis showed a statistically significant difference between academic and private practice providers (85.3% versus 57.1%, p = 0.020)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Most otologists routinely obtain AR before stapedectomy. Academic providers more commonly order CT routinely and for AR inconsistent with otosclerosis. Most respondents not ordering routine CT ordered imaging in specific clinical scenarios. Overall, there is a high level of consistency in preoperative testing regardless of practice setting or time in practice.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Two-stage ossiculoplasty has been widely used for hearing improvement in chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma. However, the outcomes of single-stage ossiculoplasty have not been fully clarified. The aim of this study is to determine whether the outcomes of single-stage ossiculoplasty are comparable with those of 2-stage ossiculoplasty in chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Medical records of 191 cases (187 patients) who underwent single-stage ossiculoplasty from January 2011 to May 2018 at our hospital were retrospectively reviewed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Polycel and titanium were used in 56 and 135 cases, respectively. In chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma, the success rate of polycel and titanium partial ossicular replacement prosthesis was 80.7% and 81.6%, respectively. In chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, the success rate of polycel and titanium partial ossicular replacement prosthesis was 63.6% and 64.6%, respectively, while that of polycel and titanium total ossicular replacement prosthesis was 45.9% and 47.8%, respectively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: These results suggest that single-stage ossiculoplasty is a suitable option for recovering postoperative hearing in chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma. Thus, if middle ear inflammation can be sufficiently treated in the first stage, single-stage ossiculoplasty is a suitable option for chronic otitis media with or without cholesteatoma.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: We aimed to investigate platelet-rich fibrin's potential role as packing material in both the middle ear and external auditory canal., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Twenty-nine patients undergoing transcanal endoscopic type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty were included in this controlled prospective clinical study. Patients were randomly assigned to platelet-rich fibrin (n=14) or absorbable gelatine (n=15) groups. Preoperative and postoperative pure-tone audiometry results, graft healing rates, tympanometry values, and Glasgow Benefit Inventory scores were compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: No significant postoperative complications were observed and the graft intake rate was 100% in both groups. Mean air-bone gap gain was 9.82 +/- 4 dB HL in the postoperative first month and 10.08 +/- 4.91 dB HL in the sixth postoperative month in the platelet-rich fibrin group. There was no statistically significant difference between the postoperative air-bone gap gains of the groups in the first (P=.537) and sixth month (P=.723) controls. There was no statistically significant difference in compliance (P = .453) between groups. The physical benefit scores of the Glasgow Benefit Inventory were significantly higher in the platelet-rich fibrin group (P=.01). There was no difference in general and social benefit scores (P > .05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: As a middle and external auditory canal packing agent, platelet-rich fibrin was as successful as absorbable gelatine in transcanal endoscopic cartilage tympanoplasty with similar functional results and graft healing rate.

N2  - Introduction: Preserving maximal quality of life is an important factor in middle ear surgery according to current standards. Taste disturbance is a common postoperative complication, which can be explained with the risk of injury due to the localisation of chorda tympani. The knowledge about this complication is mandatory for optimal surgical decision-making and for patient education as well. <ovid:br/>Objective: Investigation of early postoperative taste disturbances, to clarify the differences between the impact of different surgical interventions, and the impact of nerve manipulation. <ovid:br/>Methods: 15 stapes surgeries and 28 tympanoplasties were investigated. Patients answered subjective questionnaires before surgery and on the first postoperative day. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to measure the degree of disturbances (0-10). Degree of nerve manipulation was classified into 5 groups. <ovid:br/>Results: No significant differences between the impact of stapes surgeries and tympanoplasties could be found (9, 9.1; p = 0.861). In groups '0', '1' and '2', the VAS scores were 10, 9.26, and 8.5. Between the groups no manipulation (0) and significant manipulation without macroscopic injury (2), the difference was significant (10, 8.5; p = 0.039). In the stapes surgery group, no severe taste disturbance (VAS<5) was found. Discussion: In the case of adequate microscopic surgical technique, the rate of postoperative taste disturbances is relatively low. Conclusions : The rate of postoperative taste disturbance could be kept at a low level while the continuity of the chorda tympani could be preserved in the majority of cases. The postoperative morbidity rate is primarily influenced by the degree of nerve manipulation and not by the type of surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The study aims to investigate the effect of stapedotomy on audiology measurements and the disease-specific health-related quality of life for patients with otosclerosis using the Danish Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25 as a quality of life measuring tool., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In this study, 50 patients who had undergone stapedotomy at our department between September 2017 and December 2020 were included. Data collection was performed by audiometric testing (pure tone and speech audiometry) in the pre- and postoperative settings. Health-related quality of life was assessed pre- and postoperatively in 30 patients using the validated Danish Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The mean improvement in air conduction thresholds was 27.7 dB and the mean improvement in air-bone gap was 21.8 dB. Health- related quality of life improved significantly after stapes surgery in all subscores of the Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25 (hearing, mental condition, social restriction, and general), except for "tinnitus." The improvement in the audiometric data correlated significantly with the improvement in "total score" and "hearing function" but not with "tinnitus," "social restrictions," and "mental condition. ", <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Stapedotomy leads to significant improvement in hearing and health-related quality of life. The Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25 can be used as a valuable supplement to the hearing test by assessing health-related quality of life.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective</ovid:b>: To evaluate the long-term quality of life (QoL) in patients operated for cholesteatoma by canal wall-up tympanoplasty (CWUT) or canal wall-down tympanoplasty (CWDT) with mastoid obliteration., <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b>: QoL was evaluated by the Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire - 12 (COMQ-12). For each patient, the total score and three partial subscores, concerning disease activity, functional impairment and general impact on the patient's life were calculated. These scores were correlated with the surgical technique, as well as anatomical and functional results., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: 68 procedures were classified as CWUT and 78 as CWDT with obliteration. The mean follow-up was 65 months. Total and partial COMQ-12 scores did not show any significant difference between the two groups. Correlation analysis showed a significant direct association between the postoperative Air-Bone Gap (ABG) and both the COMQ-12 total score and functional subscore in the CWUT group., <ovid:b>Conclusions</ovid:b>: This is the first study comparing CWUT and CWDT with obliteration with the COMQ-12, thus confirming the overlapping results in terms of QoL. These findings, together with the evidence of the significantly lower rates of recidivism, show that CWDT with obliteration should be considered as a good alternative to CWUT.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Societa Italiana di Otorinolaringoiatria e Chirurgia Cervico-Facciale, Rome, Italy.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare the outcomes of patients with unilateral otosclerosis treated consecutively by a hearing aid then stapedotomy., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Monocentric, nonrandomized, prospective, longitudinal, cohort study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary university hospital., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Adult patients with a unilateral conductive hearing loss of at least 30 dB caused by otosclerosis., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Consecutive treatment by an external hearing aid followed by stapedotomy., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Differences between hearing aids and stapedotomy in quality of life, pure-tone audiometry, binaural hearing, tinnitus severity, and patient satisfaction., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Twenty-two patients were included, of which 20 (91%) underwent stapedotomy. Stapedotomy demonstrated increased quality of life according to Glasgow Health Status Inventory scores versus hearing aids (+10.4 +/- 9.4 [p = 0.0001]). Stapedotomy versus hearing aids showed improved pure-tone averages (-11.1 +/- 11.0 dB [p = 0.002]) and air-bone gaps (-11.8 +/- 10.7 dB [p = 0.0006]). Stapedotomy was superior to hearing aids for speech-in-noise recognition in the reverse dichotic condition (-8.4 +/- 26.9 dB [p = 0.004]) and showed improved sound localization accuracy in root mean square error (-14.5 +/- 24.5 degrees [p = 0.02]). Stapedotomy, but not hearing aids, showed improved patient self-evaluated tinnitus after baseline adjustment according to the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (-8.0 +/- 13.4 [p = 0.02]) and visual analog scale for tinnitus intensity (-28.7 +/- 34.1 [p = 0.006]). Overall, patients were more satisfied with surgery versus hearing aids., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Stapedotomy remains more effective compared with hearing aids with greater improvements in quality of life, patient satisfaction, hearing outcomes, and self-evaluated tinnitus.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study aimed to determine the responsiveness of three instruments (disease-specific, generic, and hearing-specific) assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adult patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media (COM)., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective correlational study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Two otology referral centers in England, United Kingdom., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Consecutive adult patients undergoing middle ear surgery for COM., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: HRQoL assessment and audiometry were performed preoperatively and 12 months after surgery. HRQoL was assessed using disease-specific (Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire-12 [COMQ-12]), generic (Euro-Qol-5D-5L), and hearing-specific (Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults [HHIA]) instruments., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 52 patients (mean [standard deviation {SD}] age, 47.3 [18.3] yr) were included, with 42 patients completing both preoperative and postoperative COMQ-12 forms. COMQ-12 and HHIA total scores significantly improved after surgery (COMQ-12: mean [SD], 28.3 [11.6] versus 14.8 [10.6]; p < 0.001; HHIA: 42.9 (28.4) versus 32.6 (27.5); p = 0.012). General HRQoL measured with the Euro-Qol-5D-5L was unaffected by surgery ( p > 0.05). The standardized response means for the COMQ-12 and HHIA total scores were 1.21 and 0.44, respectively. Postoperative air conduction thresholds were moderately correlated with the postoperative COMQ-12 ( r = 0.46, p = 0.005) and HHIA ( r = 0.41, p = 0.012) total scores., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Middle ear surgery significantly improved both disease-specific and hearing-specific HRQoL, whereas general HRQoL did not change. Only the COMQ-12 is highly responsive to surgical intervention. This study supports the use of the COMQ-12 to monitor patient-reported outcomes in both research and routine clinical settings.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

Graft success rate, demographic data, pre- and postoperative pure-tone average and word-recognition score, closure of the air - bone gap, and postoperative pain scale scores were compared between the two groups., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The graft success rates in groups I and II were 86.3% and 85.7%, respectively. The mean operation time in Group I (79.8 +/- 16.5 min) was significantly shorter than that in Group II (99.9 +/- 26.7 min) (p = 0.006). Both groups showed significant improvements in the pure-tone average and word-recognition scores. Average closure of the air - bone gap (ABG) in groups I and II was 20.7 +/- 6.9 dB and 17.6 +/- 8.4 dB, respectively. The reduction in ABG in Group I had a significantly higher magnitude than in Group II at 1000 and 2000 Hz, respectively (p = 0.028 and p = 0.017). The two groups showed no significant difference in postoperative pain scores., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic tympanoplasty with PCP showed a reliable, fascia-preserved, and excellent outcome in repairing large-sized perforations.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: To mechanically stimulate the round window (RW) membrane, an actuator with an interface coupler (IC) has the potential to improve sound transmission to the cochlea as compared to the most used RW stimulation device implanted today. If a proof-of-concept IC prototype shows promise as compared the most common method for RW stimulation, there is potential that future design development of an IC will be worthwhile., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: A variety of hearing pathologies resulting in mixed and conductive hearing loss can be addressed by mechanically stimulating the RW to transmit sound to the cochlea. The most common method for RW stimulation is with the floating mass transducer (FMT, Med-El). However, the FMT suffers poor sound transmission and unreliable device positioning. The dynamic range and bandwidth of the FMT as a RW stimulator is limited because the entire FMT needs freedom to vibrate. Thus the FMT has difficulty overcoming its own inertia and it cannot be stabilized in a manner that may limit its motion. Here we test an idea of using a generic actuator that vibrates on one side while stationary and held stable on the other (unlike the FMT), and coupling the actuator vibration to the RW membrane with a proof-of-concept IC designed to safely transmit sound to the cochlea. We determine if this proof-of-concept IC can perform as well or better than the FMT in one specimen. If so, further developments of the IC would be worthwhile., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: RW sound transmission comparison was made between an ideally implanted FMT and a proof-of-concept IC prototype driven by a piezoelectric stack actuator with vibrating tip in a fresh human temporal bone. Velocities of stapes, FMT, and IC actuator were measured with laser Doppler vibrometry to determine bandwidth, linearity, and dynamic range of cochlear sound transmission., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Stimulation with proof-of-concept prototype of the IC provided increased sound transmission, more linear output for larger dynamic range, and wider frequency range as compared to the FMT. This experiment demonstrates the potential of the IC concept to improve performance, and that it merits further development. However, it was challenging to stabilize the coupling between an external actuator and the proof-of-concept IC prototype. Thus, although we were successful in showing that this IC concept has promise, major design improvements and developments are required in the future., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: We demonstrated that the proof-of-concept IC prototype driven with a tip connected to a piezoelectric stack actuator can stimulate the RW membrane with improved acoustic performance as compared to the FMT in one specimen. This study demonstrated proof of concept: that the idea of an IC for sound transmission to the cochlea through the RW has potential, and that it would be worthwhile to pursue the IC idea with further developments. This idea has the potential to provide robust sound transmission to the cochlea via the RW while preventing possible trauma to the cochlea. We also learned that critical design improvements are necessary because coupling the generic external actuator to the IC was challenging. A possible future IC design is to integrate a piezoelectric actuator permanently to the IC, allowing only the soft balloon membrane of the IC to vibrate the RW while the rest of the exterior housing of the combined IC (with actuator) would not vibrate and would be stabilized in a fixed manner.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Introduction and objective: Mastoid obliteration technique combines the advantages of canal wall-up (CWU) and canal wall-down (CWD) approaches in the surgery of chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma. We aim to demonstrate our experience with mastoid obliteration technique using bone dust and BonAlive R (S53P4) bioactive glass granule in a comparative prospective clinical study. <ovid:br/>Patients and methods : Between 1st of March 2012 and 31st of November 2021, mastoid obliteration surgery was performed in 14 patients using bone dust (7 cases) and BonAlive R granule (7 cases). Prior to these interventions, the patients had undergone more than three ear surgeries (CWU and CWD) generally in both groups. Changes of complaints, audiological results, and changes in quality of life were analysed in both groups, postoperatively. <ovid:br/>Results: Having performed the mastoid obliteration technique, cochlear damage did not occur in either patient group. Long-term ear discharge and vertigo were occasionally observed after performing obliteration with bone dust. However, these complaints disappeared after a while. Complications were not reported in the case of obliteration with BonAlive R. Outstanding improvement was experienced in both groups. Conclusion : In our practice, mastoid obliteration surgery, using either bone dust or BonAlive R granule, has proved to

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The relationship between nasal functions and middle ear surgery is still under debate. Nasal obstruction is considered as a negative prognostic factor in middle ear surgery. This is based on the theory that it may cause Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) by leading to reduced ventilation of the middle ear, as found in several patients with nasal septal deviation, chronic rhinitis and nasal polyps., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To assess how the subjective feeling of nasal function, evaluated by a preoperative questionnaire, may be predictive of surgical outcome and/or risk of failure in middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We prospectively evaluated data of patients undergoing middle ear surgery for chronic otitis media with and without cholesteatoma. All patients completed the SNOT-22 and ETDQ-7 questionnaires. They underwent surgery for their pathology, as appropriate., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The SNOT-22 score was higher in patients with retraction pocket and in patients whose retraction pockets recurred after surgery (p < 0.05). Patients with higher score at SNOT-22 questionnaire, were more likely to show recurrence of atelectasis aftersurgery., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The SNOT-22 questionnaire, administrered before surgical procedure, can help in the identification of patients who are at risk of failure in the post-operative period, as well as ETDQ-7.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Transcutaneous active bone conduction hearing aids represent an alternative approach to middle ear surgery and conventional hearing aids for patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss. The aim of this study was to determine quality of life, subjective hearing experience and patients' satisfaction after implantation of a bone conduction hearing aid., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This monocentric and retrospective study included twelve adult patients who received a bone conduction hearing aid (Bonebridge, MedEL) consisting of an extracorporeal audio processor and a bone conduction implant (BCI) between 2013 and 2017. On average 40 months after implantation, the patients were asked to answer three questionnaires regarding quality of life (AqoL-8D), self-reported auditory disability (SSQ-12-B) and user's satisfaction (APSQ) after implantation of the Bonebridge (BB). A descriptive statistical analysis of the questionnaires followed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 12 patients aged 26-85 years (sex: m = 7, w = 5) were recruited. The quality of life of all patients after implantation of the BB (AqoL 8D) averaged an overall utility score of 0.76 (SD +/- 0.17). The mean for 'speech hearing' in the SSQ-12-B was + 2.43 (SD +/- 2.03), + 1.94 (SD +/- 1.48) for 'spatial hearing' and + 2.28 (SD +/- 2.32) for 'qualities of hearing'. 11 out of 12 patients reported an improvement in their overall hearing. The APSQ score for the subsection 'wearing comfort' was 3.50 (SD +/- 0.87), 'social life' attained a mean of 4.17 (SD +/- 1.06). The 'device inconveniences' reached 4.02 (SD +/- 0.71) and 'usability' of the device was measured at 4.23 (SD +/- 1.06). The average wearing time of the audio processor in the cohort was 11 h per day, with 8 of 12 patients reporting the maximum length of 12 h per day., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: BB implantation results in a gain in the perceived quality of life (AqoL 8D). The SSQ-12-B shows an improvement in subjective hearing. According to the APSQ, it can be assumed that the BB audio processor, although in an extracorporeal position, is rated as a useful instrument with positive impact on social life. The majority stated that they had subjectively benefited from BB implantation and that there were no significant physical or sensory limitations after implantation.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> To investigate the postoperative effect of different diameters of CO2 laser tympanostomy in the treatment of secretory otitis media caused by radiotherapy in patients with head and neck tumor, and to find out the best diameter range of tympanostomy according to the curative effect. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Methods:</ovid:b> The 40 ears after radiotherapy in the otorhinolaryngology department. The average 40 ears were divided into two groups: the diameter of perforation <=3 mm and the diameter of perforation > 3 mm. Each group was 20 ears. Both groups were compared with tympanum and pure tone threshold after perforation, and then performed pure tone threshold measurement, tympanoplasty, and otoendoscopy 1,3,6 month after operation respectively. Meanwhile, patients were asked to assist in filling in the score scale of eustachian tube dysfunction(ETDQ-7), to understand the difference in clinical symptoms and to count the complications after the operation. The changes of the size of the holes were compared with the corresponding attractors during the follow-up. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> 1After the operation, the mean value of pure tone hearing threshold air bone conduction difference in the diameter of perforation <=3 mm group was significantly lower than that in the diameter of perforation >3 mm group (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.05), indicating that the postoperative hearing recovery in the diameter of perforation <=3 mm group was better than that in the diameter of perforation >3 mm group. 2Within six months after the operation, the tympanic membrane in the group a healed more than that in the diameter of perforation >3 mm group(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>< 0.01); in patients with an unclosed tympanic membrane in the diameter of perforation <=3 mm group and the diameter of perforation >3 mm group, the number of smaller tympanic membrane diameter in the diameter of perforation <=3 mm group was more than that in the diameter of perforation >3 mm group(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>< 0.01). 3The effective rates of the diameter of perforation<=3 mm group and the diameter of perforation>3 mm group were 75% and 35%, respectively. 4The incidence of postoperative complications such as middle ear infection and tympanic membrane nonunion in the diameter of perforation <=3 mm group and the diameter of perforation>3 mm group were 25% and 45%, respectively, the incidence of postoperative complications in the diameter of perforation <=3 mm group was significantly lower than that in the diameter of perforation>3 mm group(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.05). 5The subjective feelings of patients in the diameter of perforation <=3 mm group was significantly improved after the operation(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.01). Compared with the postoperative questionnaire, the scores of Eustachian tube dysfunction score in the the diameter of perforation <=3 mm groups after treatment were significantly better than the diameter of perforation>3 mm group(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.01). <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> According to this experimental study, in the range of 2-4 mm, 2.5 mm <= diameter <= 3.0 mm, the postoperative effect is better.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright&#xa9; by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - Hoverflies are a conspicuous and popular family within the Diptera. The larvae as well as the adults are able to colonize a wide range of habitats, and many species play important roles as pollinators, in pest management and nowadays in applied nature conservation issues. Despite of this, the state of knowledge on the hoverflies of Austria is deficient: Available literature is outdated in systematics and the species inventory is obviously incomplete. These facts led us to study the Austrian hoverfly fauna in more detail. Syrphidae records from an extensive literature search, additional unpublished data from museum collections and data from own fieldwork were compiled to build a comprehensive checklist of Austrian hoverflies. The species distributions are given by federal state in order to retain a precise overview of this Diptera group. The framework of this research is based on 20520 records and in total, 271957 individuals. The checklist includes 430 confirmed species. An additional 25 hoverfly species are discussed but not included in the list. These are species for which it is unclear if the locality lies within the present borders of Austria, or whose voucher specimens were not available for re-examination. In total 17 hoverfly species are new to Austria: Anasimyia contracta Claussen Torp, 1980; Brachyopa grunewaldensis Kassebeer 2000; Brachyopa obscura Thompson Torp, 1982; Brachyopa silviae Doczkal Dziock, 2004; Cheilosia orthotricha Vuji Claussen, 1994; Eristalis picea (Falln, 1817); Melangyna ericarum (Collin, 1946); Melangyna lucifera Nielsen, 1980; Melangyna pavlovskyi Violovitsh, 1956; Melanogaster curvistylus Vuji Stuke, 1998; Merodon moenium (Wiedemann, 1822); Paragus absidatus Goeldlin, 1971; Paragus bradescui Stanescu, 1981; Platycheirus laskai (Nielsen, 1999); Sphegina verecunda Collin, 1937; Temnostoma angustistriatum Krivosheina, 2002 and Temnostoma meridionale Krivosheina Mamayev, 1962. In addition, 278 first records for several Austrian federal states are published. With 331 species, Styria currently hosts the largest number of documented species per federal state, followed by Lower Austria (307 spp.), Upper Austria (269 spp.), Carinthia (259 spp.), Vorarlberg (234 spp.), Burgenland (201 spp.), North Tyrol (172 spp.), Vienna (169 spp.), Salzburg (155 spp.) and Eastern Tyrol (154 spp.).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare audiologic outcomes, quality-of-life (QoL) and usage-of-device (UoD) between case-matched, otosclerotic patients with mixed hearing loss (MHL) which received (a) stapedotomy and postoperative amplification with hearing aids (SDT+HA) or (b) short-incudial process coupled active middle ear implant with simultaneous stapedotomy (mPP)., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Prospective, matched case-control, follow-up study conducted at two tertiary otologic referral centers. Eligible were all otosclerotic patients with MHL, which received mPP at either of the two institutions. A case-matched-cohort of SDT+HA-patients was generated from the hospitals database based on preoperative audiologic findings., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: For sound- and speech perception, primary outcome parameters were the mean postoperative, aided air-conduction pure tone average (mpa-AC-PTA) and word recognition score at 80 dB speech level (mpa-WRS), for QoL the mean Nijmegen-Cochlear-Implant-Questionnaire (NCIQ) total-score, and for UoD the mean score rated on a 10-point Likert-scale., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 28 patients were included; 14 received mPP; mpa-AC-PTA and mpa-WRS significantly improved from 47.1 dB-HL to 34.3 dB-HL (-12.8 dB-HL; p < 0.001) and from 75.0% to 93.2% (+18.2%; p = 0.002) compared to 46.5 dB-HL to 31.9 dB-HL (-14.8 dB-HL; p < 0.008) and 75.0% to 93.2% (+18.2%; p = 0.002) for SDT+HA. No significant difference between groups was observed (all p > 0.1). NCIQ total-score between groups did not significantly differ (70.4 vs. 69.9; p = 0.93). UoD for mPP was significantly higher (6.1 vs. 3.0; p < 0.001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: If medical/technical problems prevent usage of HA in otosclerosis with MHL, mPP can be considered as effective treatment option with similar audiological outcome and QoL. A significantly higher UoD for mPP was observed.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2022 The Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. on behalf of Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: In cholesteatoma, the prognosis of tympanoplasty has been well discussed in terms of hearing outcomes and residual or recurrent lesions. Postoperative dizziness and vertigo are major complications of tympanoplasty; however, few reports are available., <ovid:b>AIMS/OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: We investigated each condition of cholesteatoma postoperative vestibular risk using the STAM system and staging published by EAONO/JOS, as well as findings on bony destruction., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: From April 2010 to March 2021, 156 patients (166 ears) with cholesteatoma who underwent primary microscopic tympanoplasty at our hospital were registered. Subjective vestibular symptoms were recorded the day after surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Postoperative vestibular symptoms were observed in 13.9% of subjects. All of them were stage II and had both attic and mastoid lesions. Attic (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .05) and mastoid (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .01) lesions were risk factors. Multivariate analysis showed that significant differences were found in past histories of vestibular symptoms (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .05) and exposure of the dura mater (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .01)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE</ovid:b>: In the exposed dura group, the length of the prominence of the lateral semicircular canal to the middle cranial fossa dura was significantly shorter than that of the non-exposed group (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .01). Narrow working space and downward operation may increase vestibular risk.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: SAMEO-ATO classification is an international consensual tool published in 2018. In order to evaluate the ease of use and reliability of this classification in pediatric otologic surgery, a retrospective study was conducted in our tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: We began to use IOOG classification in September 2018, after a 15-day testing period. In this monocentric retrospective study, we reviewed the classification and the operative charts of all the pediatric middle ear surgeries after the first 5 months of use. Each classification was carefully re-checked by a junior and senior surgeon. In parallel, all the surgeons involved received a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use, with a score from 1 (very difficult) to 5 (very easy)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: From September 2018 to February 2019, the tool was used for 119 pediatric surgeries, involving 13 surgeons. The indications for surgery were tympanic membrane perforations (28/119, 23.5%), retraction pockets (36/119, 30.3%), cholesteatoma first procedures (13/119, 10.9%), cholesteatoma revision procedures (41/119, 34.5%) and temporal bone fracture (1/119, 0.8%). All surgical procedures performed could be classified with the ATO-SAMEO classification. We found misclassification in 29/119 cases (24%), 79% of which concerning ATO items. Of the 8 SAMEO-ATO categories in 119 surgeries, the error rate was 4.5% (49/952). Surgeons reported a mean score of use of 4 (quite easy)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The easy-to-use SAMEO-ATO classification is well suited for pediatric otology and to the categorization of surgical procedures. However, in a multi-user context, misclassifications were observed in up to a quarter of cases during the first months of use. Carefully anticipated explanations and guidelines given to surgeons should ensure an optimal quality of rating.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: There is concern that current otolaryngology residents may not receive adequate surgical training. We aimed to characterize residents' surgical experiences at 5 academic centers performing the 14 key indicator procedures (KIPs) outlined by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Five otolaryngology training programs., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Data were gathered from December 2019 to December 2020 with a smartphone application from the Society for Improving Medical Professional Learning. After each operation, residents and faculty rated trainee autonomy on a 4-level Zwisch scale and performance on a 5-level modified Dreyfus scale., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Residents and attendings (n = 92 and 78, respectively) logged 2984 evaluations. Attending ratings of resident autonomy and performance increased with training level (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .001). Resident self-assessments of autonomy and performance were lower than paired attending assessments (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .001). Among attending evaluations of KIPs performed by senior residents (postgraduate year 4 or 5), 55% of cases were performed with meaningful autonomy (passive help or supervision only). Similarly, attendings rated 55% of these cases as a practice-ready or exceptional performance. Senior residents had meaningful autonomy for >=50% of cases for most KIPs, with the exception of flaps and grafts (40%), pediatric/adult airway (39%), and stapedectomy/ossiculoplasty (33%). Similarly, senior residents received practice-ready or exceptional performance ratings for >=50% of cases across all KIPs other than pediatric/adult airway (42%) and stapedectomy/ossiculoplasty (33%)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In this multicenter study, resident surgical autonomy and performance varied across otolaryngology KIPs. The development of nationwide benchmarks will help programs and residents set educational goals., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 2.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to present our concept in the management of extracranial temporal bone paragangliomas and demonstrate the outcome after primary surgical management of the middle ear component, with an individualized indication for adjuvant radiotherapy., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The records of all patients treated for extracranial jugulotympanic paragangliomas by means of primary surgical management between 2010 and 2021 were studied retrospectively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Twenty-nine patients made up our study sample (mean age 58.8 years). 15 cases were managed solely by means of surgery. Out of the remaining 14 cases with reduction of the middle ear component, adjuvant irradiation was performed in 11 cases, whereas a wait-and-scan strategy was adopted at the patient's request in three cases. No further growth was detected in our study cases., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Our protocol seems to be associated with an acceptable quality of life and a satisfactory oncologic outcome.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - The purpose of this Technical Note is to describe the surgical technique to transform canal wall down tympanoplasty into canal wall up tympanoplasty, that is, to rehabilitate a recess cavity by filling the mastoid and epitympanic cavities with synthetic tissue (bioactive glass) and recreating a normal-caliber external auditory canal. Mastoid cavity obliteration leads to a clinically significant improvement in health-related quality of life without increasing risk of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma, conditional upon technically impeccable surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Equivalent outcomes, such as procedural safety and audiometry, have been reported between endoscopic ear surgery (EES) and microscopic ear surgery (MES). This study aims to determine if EES leads to decreased postoperative pain when compared with MES., <ovid:b>DATA SOURCES</ovid:b>: PubMed, OVID MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central from 2000 to 2020., <ovid:b>REVIEW METHODS</ovid:b>: A systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines and standardized bias assessment was performed. Studies containing original data on postoperative pain following EES and MES were included., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Fourteen studies fulfilled eligibility: 7 retrospective studies, 6 randomized controlled trials, and 1 case series. Studies included surgery for cholesteatoma (n = 3), tympanoplasty/myringoplasty (n = 6), and stapedotomy (n = 5), pooling data from 974 patients. Postoperative pain was quantitatively described through a variety of numeric pain scores. Meta-analysis was performed on 11 studies. Among the 7 studies utilizing the numeric rating scale or visual analog scale, postoperative pain in the EES cohort was significantly lower than that of the MES cohort (standardized mean difference = -1.45 [95% CI, -2.05 to -0.85], <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .001). Similarly, pain scores were lower in the EES cohort among the 4 studies utilizing the Three Grades Pain Scale (odds ratio = 0.2 [95% CI, 0.09-0.45], <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .001). Additional qualitative strengths identified in EES included significant improvements in visualization, operative time, postoperative complications, and decreased need for canalplasty. Quality assessment indicated low to moderate risk of bias for all studies., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Meta-analysis confirms that EES results in significantly less postoperative pain when compared with MES. This surgical approach should be considered in the armamentarium of otologic surgeons, allowing for improved outcomes.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To quantify changes in the perceived epithelial border with narrow band imaging (NBI) and white light imaging (WLI) during cholesteatoma surgery and to objectify possible benefits of NBI in otology., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Perioperative digital endoscopic images were captured during combined approach tympanoplasty at our tertiary referral center using WLI and NBI (415 nm and 540 nm wavelengths). Sixteen otologic surgeon defined the epithelial borders within 16 identical WLI and NBI photos. Pixels of these selections were calculated to analyze the quantitative difference between WLI and NBI. A questionnaire also analyzed the qualitative differences., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixteen otologic surgeons participated in the study. Stratified per photo, only two photos yielded a significant difference: less pixels were selected with NBI than WLI. A Bland-Altman plot showed no systemic error. Stratified per otologist, four participants selected significantly more pixels with WLI than with NBI. Overall, no significant difference between selected pixels was found. Sub-analyses of surgeons with more than 5 years of experience yielded no additional findings. Despite these results, 60% believed NBI could be advantageous in defining epithelial borders, of which 83% believed NBI could reduce the risk of residual disease., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: There was no objective difference in the identification of epithelial borders with NBI compared to WLI in cholesteatoma surgery. Therefore, we do not expect the use of NBI to evidently decrease the risk of residual cholesteatoma. However, subjective assessment does suggest a possible benefit of lighting techniques in otology., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3</ovid:b>:<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021. The Author(s).

The study protocol was registered with the Prospectively Registered Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (reference number: CRD42021234753)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 23 studies including 3162 patients were enrolled. Of these patients, only 392 had otosclerosis and underwent cochlear implantation. The duration of deafness was reported in only eight studies, extending up to 50 years. Far-advanced otosclerosis was observed in 153 patients. A total of 56 patients used hearing aids. Stapedectomy and stapedotomy were performed in 118 and 63 patients, respectively. In three studies, the temporary success of stapedectomy and stapedotomy was 6 (43%) and 5 (71%) patients, respectively. Computed tomography was used as a preoperative assessment tool in most studies (n = 14, 60.9%). Incomplete implant insertion occurred in 17 patients, while facial nerve stimulation occurred in 36 patients after implantation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Cochlear implantation is a relatively safe modality that can provide promising audiological outcomes in patients with otosclerosis. However, several factors, including cochlear ossification, duration of deafness, and previous operations, can affect its outcomes. Further studies with a larger sample population are recommended.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Diffusion-weighted imaging(DWI) in MRI has been developed as an important tool for the detection of cholesteatoma. Various DWI sequences are available. This study aims to evaluate the importance of the observer's reliance level for the detection of cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Forty patients meeting the following criteria were included in the study: (1) chronic otitis media, (2) preoperative MRI including various DWI sequences, and (3) middle-ear surgery. The MRI protocol contained the following sequences: (1) axial and (2) coronal echoplanar imaging (EPI) readout-segmented (RESOLVE) DWI with Trace acquisition and (3) coronal non-EPI half-Fourier acquired single-shot turbo spin-echo (HASTE) DWI. Cholesteatoma diagnosis was based on standard diagnostic criteria for cholesteatoma with DWI. Additionally, the radiologists were asked to grade personal reliance on their diagnosis using a Likert-type scale from 1 = very insecure to 5 = very secure., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Axial and coronal RESOLVE DWI showed a sensitivity of 77.3% and a specificity of 72.2%, respectively. The mean reliance was 3.9 for axial and 3.8 for coronal images. HASTE DWI had a sensitivity/specificity of 81.8%/66.7% with the highest reliance of all evaluated sequences (4.4). Cases with a reliance level of 5 showed a sensitivity/specificity of 100% in all sequences. A reliance level of 5 was given in the axial and coronal RESOLVE DWI in 32.5% of cases and in the HASTE DWI in 57.5%., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The evaluated DWI sequences showed comparable results. The reliance level significantly improved the predictor of cholesteatoma disease with MRI techniques.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 American Society of Neuroimaging.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the recently proposed SAMEO-ATO framework for middle ear and mastoid surgery, by correlating it with the functional outcome in a large cohort of patients operated for middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma in a tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We retrospectively included all surgeries for middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma undergone in our Department between January 2009 and December 2014, by excluding revision surgeries, congenital and petrous bone cholesteatoma. All surgeries were classified according to the SAMEO-ATO framework. The post-operative air bone gap (ABG) was calculated and chosen as benchmark parameter for the correlation analysis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 282 consecutive surgeries for middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma were released in the study period on a total of 273 patients, with a mean age of 41.2 years. All patients were followed for an average period of 55.3 months. 54% of patients underwent M2c mastoidectomy (Canal Wall Down, CWD), while the remaining underwent Canal Wall Up (CWU) procedures, being M1b2a mastoidectomy the most common one (33%). Mean pre-operative and post-operative ABGs were 29.2 and 23.5 dB, with a significant improvement (p < 0.0001). 'Mastoidectomy' and 'Ossicular reconstruction' parameters of SAMEO-ATO showed significant association with postoperative ABG, with smaller residual gaps for the classes Mx and On, and worse hearing results for M3a and Ox., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Our results show the utility of SAMEO-ATO framework, and in particular of 'M' (Mastoidectomy) and 'O' (Ossicular reconstruction) parameters, in predicting the hearing outcome.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To characterize postoperative pain after tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy and correlate between pain severity and various technical aspects of the surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We carried out a prospective cohort study of patients undergoing ear surgery in a tertiary referral center between 7/2018 and 7/2019. Patients filled in a pain questionnaire and scored pain intensity on a visual analog scale preoperatively and on postoperative days (POD) 1-4, 21, and 49. The responses were correlated with clinical and operative data, including surgical technique-related details., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixty-two patients participated in the study (27 males and 35 females, average age 41.1 +/- 20.02 years [range 18-68]). The median preoperative VAS was 5, followed by 6 on POD1, 5 on POD3, and 1 at 3 and 9 weeks. The preoperative questionnaire score normalized to 10 was 4.5 (32/70), 5.1 on POD1, 4.7 on POD3, 0.85 at 3 weeks and 0.85 at 9 weeks. The predictive factors for increased postoperative pain were younger age, the presence of a comorbidity, revision surgery, preoperative dizziness or tinnitus and postoperative tinnitus. The predictive factors for decreased pain were smoking and the addition of a mastoidectomy. None of the factors related to the surgical technique (e.g., surgical approaches, type of reconstruction, specific surgeon) significantly affected the questionnaire responses or the pain VAS intensity scores., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: We demonstrated that younger age, the presence of a comorbidity, revision surgery, preoperative dizziness or tinnitus and postoperative tinnitus were predictors of increased pain after tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy, while the inclusion of a mastoidectomy was a predictor of decreased pain.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

N2  - The inception of medial grafting as a technique for tympanic membrane repair was a critical milestone in the history of otology. John Shea introduced the medial graft technique and the use of vein grafts for tympanoplasty in 1960 after realizing that the vein grafts that he used to repair the oval window after stapedectomy could also be utilized to repair tympanic membrane perforations. At the time, tympanoplasty often utilized skin grafts, which required placement of the graft lateral to the tympanic membrane annulus. Placement of the graft medial to the tympanic membrane annulus allowed for more efficient surgery and avoided the complications associated with lateral grafting, such as blunting and lateralization. The introduction of vein grafts in tympanoplasty prompted a fundamental shift in technique from lateral to medial grafting, paving the way for decades of innovation in tympanoplasty.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: We aimed to evaluate the speech intelligibility benefit in noise provided by stapedotomy in the treatment of unilateral otosclerosis., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We enrolled adults suffering from unilateral conductive hearing loss and followed them up until 9 months after surgery. The patients underwent a free field speech hearing evaluation using the French Matrix test before and after stapedotomy. Speech material was sent to the front of the patients (S0) and noise was presented either at the front (N0), or at the operated ear (N-90) or at the non-operated ear (N + 90). The speech intelligibility benefit in noise was assessed by comparing Squelch effect (SE), Head shadow effect (HS) and Binaural redundancy (BR) before and after surgery. SE was measured as the difference in speech reception thresholds (SRT) between S0N + 90 situations before and after surgery, HS as the difference in SRT between S0N + 90 and S0N-90 situations, and BR as the difference in SRT between S0N0 situations before and after surgery. In addition, two quality of life's questionnaires were completed by patients to evaluate their discomfort., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Among 25 patients, 19 were followed up during 9 months, 4 were excluded and 2 were lost for the following-up. Stapedotomy provided a restoration of SE of 3.7 dB SNR (p < 0.001) and a BR gain of 1.8 dB SNR (p < 0.001). HS did not show any statistical variation after surgery (p = 0.077). Finally, the questionnaires showed a residual hearing discomfort., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Stapedotomy provided a binaural benefit with the restoration of the SE and BR but which remained lower than in the normal-hearing population., <ovid:b>TRIAL REGISTRATION</ovid:b>: The 07/02/2018 on Clinical.Trial.Gouv: NCT03587792.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To assess the postoperative quality of life (QoL) of patients operated on for chronic otitis media (COM) and cholesteatoma by endoscopic approach, with respect to disease-specific complaints and psychological distress, using two validated questionnaires: Chronic Ear Survey (CES) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Eighty-five consecutive patients operated on for cholesteatoma and COM by endoscopic tympanoplasty from March 2018 to February 2020 filled in CES and DASS-21, within one month prior to surgery. A second administration of each questionnaire was performed at the yearly postoperative evaluation. A multivariate analysis using a linear regression model was performed to evaluate the role of the different variables associated with the questionnaires' subscales and overall scores., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A significant improvement was achieved in all CES and DASS-21 subscales after endoscopic tympanoplasty. No patient showed a DASS-21 score compatible with a psychological distress both at the pre- and postoperative assessments. At multivariate analysis, the only significant factors associated with postoperative improvement in CES scores were preoperative DASS-21 "depression" score and months of follow-up., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic tympanoplasty shows significantly improved QoL as assessed by disease-specific and psycho-emotional questionnaires. A subjective favourable effect of fully endoscopic ear surgery was demonstrated.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Taste perception is often affected after stapes surgery despite effort to preserve chorda tympani nerve. The aim was to examine changes of particular taste qualities and their recovery after operation of otosclerosis., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Taste function was prospectively investigated with a questionnaire and a taste strip test (TST) preoperatively, 3-5 days and 1 year after stapes surgery with the preservation of CTN., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In the early postoperative examination, 34/42 patients had a lower TST score, 7/42 decrease of taste in the questionnaire. One year after surgery, 11/42 patients had a lower TST score, 1/42 patients decrease of taste in the questionnaire. The most pronounced decrease in the TST score was in sweet (- 1.76 points, p < 0.001), followed by bitter (- 1.71 points, p < 0.001), salty (- 1.64 points, p < 0.001) and sour taste (- 1.33 points, p < 0.001). The sour taste had a significant lower alteration compared to others. Men had significantly pronounced alteration in salty taste compared to women. The complete recovery was proved in bitter taste. Better recovery in bitter taste was observed in patients younger than 45 years of age., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Gustatory changes after stapes surgery are mostly transient with different impairment and recovery rate for particular taste qualities. A sour taste seems to be relatively resistant to damage. The best recovery rate is in a bitter taste, especially in younger patients.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) is considered a minimally invasive technique. It is hypothesized that patients after endoscopic procedures experience less pain and require fewer painkillers. Our aim was to compare patients' postoperative pain and need for analgesics in patients undergoing microscopic and endoscopic ear surgeries., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: a single-institution, prospective study included 92 patients undergoing ear procedures (48 cholesteatoma and 44 reconstructive);(43 endoscopic and 49 microscopic) during 1/2016-1/2018. The postoperative pain (visual analogue scale (VAS) 0-10) and painkillers consumption were recorded and compared in each subgroup., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: VAS (P=0.02) and analgesics consumption (P=0.06) were lower after endoscopic ear surgeries. In the cholesteatoma group, 94% of endoscopic patients reported VAS 0-2 in contrast to 58 % of microscopic patients on day 1 (P=0.04). Similar tendencies were revealed in reconstructive cases, i.e. 92% compared to 73% (P>0.05). On day 1, 92% of endoscopic, and 77% of microscopic reconstruction patients received no painkillers group (P=0.06). In the cholesteatoma patients, 88% of endoscopic patients, 43% of microscopic patients using endaural approach, and 75% of microscopic patients using retroauricular approach, required no painkillers on the postoperative day 1 (P>0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Our study revealed that the EES is associated with less postoperative pain than the conventional microscopic ear surgery. It seems that it is rather the transmeatal approach, and not the endoscope itself that reduces postoperative pain. The removal of the same size cholesteatoma using endoscope (rather than using microscope) leads to less intensive postoperative pain. Consequently, it was not surprising that patients after endoscopic ear surgery very rarely took painkillers.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: We compared the functional outcomes of fat myringoplasty and areolar tympanoplasty through a small postauricular incision in patients who underwent transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The study included patients who underwent myringoplasty or type I tympanoplasty using TEES in our Department of Otolaryngology between April 2016 and May 2019. The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the type of graft material used, which was selected based on the available amount of subcutaneous fat and the surgeon's experience., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In total, 63 patients received fat tissue grafts (group A) and 77 received areolar tissue grafts (group B). The median operative time was significantly longer in group B (132 minutes) than in group A (65 minutes); perforations were significantly larger in group B than in group A (61.0% vs 29.7% of the eardrum surface). The postoperative air conduction threshold, air-bone gap, and speech reception threshold values were significantly lower than the preoperative values in both groups. The graft success rate did not significantly differ between groups A (96.8%, 61/63) and B (96.1%, 74/77). In group A, the perforation was > 35% of the eardrum surface in 27.0% (17/63) of the patients; the graft success rate was 100% (17/17). In the remaining 46 patients (perforation > 35%), the graft success rate was 95.7% (44/46); this difference was not statistically significant., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Transcanal endoscopic ear surgery increases the usefulness of fat myringoplasty for the repair of perforations > 35% of the eardrum surface. Postauricular fatty and areolar tissues are suitable for this simple and rapid technique, which yields excellent outcomes.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate the functional results of glass ionomer cement (GIC) and incus transposition (IT) used for treatment of incus long process defects in pediatric patients. The medical records of 40 patients, aged 10 to 16 years, who underwent ossicular reconstruction due to incus long process defect between January 2010 and July 2017 were reviewed for age and gender, types of ossiculoplasty technique, types of graft used for tympanic membrane repair, preoperative-postoperative audiological examinations, and length of follow-up. The mean preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 29.40 (8.47) dB, the mean postoperative ABG was 15.25 (8.55) dB in the entire group, and the difference was statistically significant (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .001). The functional outcome (ABG <= 20 dB) was 80% (32 patients) in the entire group. The mean hearing gain was 18.83 (9.43) dB and postoperative mean ABG was 20 dB or better in 17 (94.4%) patients in the GIC group. The mean hearing gain was 10.31 (9.44) dB, and postoperative mean ABG was 20 dB or better in 14 (63.6%) patients in the IT group. The mean hearing gain was significantly higher in the GIC group than in the IT group (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = .026), and the postoperative mean ABG was significantly higher in the IT group than in the GIC group (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = .045). The functional success rates were significantly higher in GIC group than in IT group (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = .020). There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of postoperative speech reception threshold and word recognition scores (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = .628, <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = .260, respectively). The graft success rates were 94.4% (17 patients) in the GIC group and 90.9% (20 patients) in the IT groups. There was no statistically significant difference between groups in operated side (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> = 1.000). Reconstruction of small incus long process defects using GIC is a valuable technique and can be safely used in pediatric patients. The hearing outcomes are significantly better in GIC rebridging technique when compared with a sculpted IT technique.

N2  - <b>Introduction:</b> Nowadays, there are many options to treat hearing-impaired patients: tympanoplastic surgery, hearing aids and a wide range of implantable devices.</br></br> <b>Aim:</b> The aim of this study is to present the mid-term audiological and quality of life benefits after the implantation of Osia R, an active piezoelectric bone conduction hearing implant. </br></br> <b>Material and methods:</b> The state of the tissues in the implanted area, as well as audiological and quality of life results were analyzed at six, nine and twelve months after implantation in a group of four adult patients with bilateral mixed hearing loss (1 after bilateral canal-wall-down mastoidectomy, 2 with chronic simple otitis media and after myringoplasty in the opposite ear, 1 with bilateral otosclerosis and after stapedotomy in the opposite ear). </br></br> <b>Results:</b> No postoperative complications were found in any of the cases. One year after surgery the mean audiological gain in FF PTA4 (pure tone average for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) was 52.2 +/- 3.5 dB in comparison to the unaided situation, the mean speech understanding with Osia R in quiet was 90 +/- 8.2% for 50 dB SPL, 98.8 +/- 2.5% for 65 dB SPL and 100 +/- 0% for 80 dB SPL, and the mean speech understanding with Osia R in noise was 37.5% +/- 23.6 for 50 dB SPL, 93.8 +/- 4.8% for 65 dB SPL and 98.8 +/- 2.5% for 80 dB SPL. There was also an evident improvement in the quality of hearing as well as in the quality of life, measured by APHAB (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit) and SSQ (Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale). </br></br> <b>Conclusions:</b> The Osia R is an effective treatment option for patients with bilateral mixed hearing loss. The mid-term audiological and quality of life results are excellent, but further observations including bigger groups of patients and a longer follow- -up are required.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Labyrinthine fistula is one of the most frequent complications of cholesteatoma (CHO), occurring in about 8% of cases in the literature. In about 90% of cases, it is located at the level of the lateral semicircular canal, and its clinical manifestation includes vertigo, nystagmus and positive Hennebert and Tullio signs. The management of lateral semicircular canal fistula (LSCF) secondary to CHO classically requires a retroauricular access by performing a canal wall-up (CWU) or canal wall-down (CWD) mastoidectomy. However, in case of a CHO confined to the tympanic cavity causing a LSCF on the ampullar arm, a transcanal exclusive endoscopic approach could be considered., <ovid:b>AIMS</ovid:b>: The aim of this study is to describe the feasibility of a transcanal exclusive endoscopic approach in the management of a CHO confined to the tympanic cavity causing a LSCF on the ampullar arm., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: From January 2019 to December 2020, three patients with LSCF secondary to mesotympanic CHO underwent transcanal exclusive endoscopic ear surgery repair at the Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, University Hospital of Modena, Italy., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: This technique was successfully employed to treat LSCF in all three cases and was planned as a two-stage surgery, performing ossiculoplasty after 12-18 months. Functional outcomes were also satisfactory: complete eradication of CHO, hearing preservation and complete resolution of symptoms., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: In case of a CHO confined to the tympanic cavity causing an LSCF on the ampullar arm, a transcanal exclusive endoscopic approach could be considered as a feasible and safe technique.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(40): 1619-1626. Summary. The Vibrant Soundbridge active middle ear implant can provide a reliable solution for hearing rehabilitation of patients with conductive, sensorineural or mixed hearing loss. For sensorineural hearing loss, the air conduction threshold of the patient should not be more increased than 80-85 dBHL at the range of 3-4 kHz, and for conductive and mixed hearing loss, the bone conduction threshold should not be more increased than 45-65 dBHL between 0.5 and 4 kHz. The standard surgical procedure was originally designed for purely sensorineural hearing loss, and the fixation clip of the vibrating transducer needed to be crimped onto the long process of the incus. In many cases, it is impossible to crimp the vibrator onto the incus. In order to solve such circumstances, fixation clips (couplers) have been developed. There are two options to crimp the device on the incus: applying a long process coupler or a short process coupler. For conductive or mixed hearing loss, a round window soft coupler has been introduced. In advanced otosclerotic cases, a special combined technique of Soundbridge implantation with simultaneous stapedotomy can result in sufficient hearing rehabilitation. These techniques significantly broadened the scale of possibilities for the implantation, therefore, it became a widely utilized, reliable procedure. At the Department of Otorhino-laryngology, Clinical Center, University of Pecs, in addition to a noteworthy amount of incus vibroplasty, several cases of round window vibroplasty have also been performed. The aim of the present study is to summarize the history of development of the Vibrant Soundbridge and to present an overview of the applicable surgical techniques.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the facial nerve function and audiological results of delayed (by at least one month after the insult) transmastoid facial nerve decompression (FND) in traumatic facial nerve paralysis (FNP)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Medical records of 57 patients with traumatic FNP were reviewed and surgical results of 13 patients (mean age 28.0 +/- 17.67, range 3-67) undergoing transmastoid FND were analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative mean hearing thresholds were compared using 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz. Facial nerve function was graded according to the House-Brackmann scale (HB) before and after surgery. HB scale results of grade III or better were accepted as good results postoperatively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Preoperative HB grades were V in 5 and VI in 8 patients. Twelve of 13 patients had good recovery of facial nerve function regardless of the operation timing. When mean preoperative and postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) values were compared (except the patients with total sensorineural hearing loss), the mean preoperative ABG was 33 +/- 15.9 dB, and mean postoperative ABG was 17.2 +/- 8.68 dB. There was a mean hearing gain of 15.8 dB after transmastoid facial nerve decompression surgery. Surgery and anesthesia-related complications were not seen in any patients., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The transmastoid route can be used safely and effectively with elimination of the risks of craniotomy and middle fossa surgery for patients with traumatic FNP. Hearing improvement can be achieved by performing ossicular chain reconstruction during decompression surgery for patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss (HL).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare the anatomical and functional results of the ossicular chain reconstruction with classic titanium adjustable prostheses and titanium adjustable prostheses with hydroxyapatite cap., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The 300 patients (360 cases) with chronic suppurative otitis media were examined and operated. The patients are divided into 2 groups. Group A included patients who received an ossicular prosthesis with a hydroxyapatite cap (90 cases with a partial prosthesis and 90 with a full one). Group B included patients who received prostheses without hydroxyapatitis (90 cases with a partial prosthesis and 90 with a complete one). The patients who received a prosthesis with a hydroxyapatite cap were divided into two subgroups, depending on the autotissue, which was placed between the prosthesis cap and the nontympanic membrane: this is an autocartilage plate or perichondrium/fascial graft. The follow-up period after surgery was 38.5+/-14.4 months (from 12 to 48 months). In the long-term postoperative period, the subjects were assessed the values of the bone-air gap (BAG), the consistency of the nontympanic membrane, and the presence of signs of extrusion of the prosthesis cap. Comparison of anatomical and functional results between patients with full and partial ossicular prostheses was performed separately., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A good result in the form of a 20 dB or more dB BAG reduction was achieved in 82.2% of patients who received a partial prosthesis (85 patients in group A and 63 in group B), and in 57.8% of patients who received a complete prosthesis (45 patients in group A and 59 in group B). The BAG values in the long-term period after surgery did not statistically significantly differ between patients who received a prosthesis with a hydroxyapatite cap or a fully titanium one (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i>=0.939 for patients with full prostheses and <ovid:i>p</ovid:i>=0.745 for patients with partial prostheses). The placement of cartilage or perichondrium/fascial graft between the hydroxyapatite prosthesis cap and the nontympanic membrane also did not affect the functional outcome (with full prostheses - <ovid:i>p</ovid:i>=0.651, with partial prostheses - <ovid:i>p</ovid:i>=0.142)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: It is possible to use ossicular prostheses with a hydroxyapatite cap without placing an autocartilaginous plate between the nontympanic membrane and the cap of the prosthesis. In the long term period, functional and anatomical results with hydroxyapatite cap prostheses do not differ statistically significantly from those with all-titanium prostheses.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (Mesna) has been proposed as a chemical aid in any surgical procedure, including cholesteatoma surgery. This review investigated the benefits and safety of Mesna during surgical management of cholesteatoma and adhesive otitis media., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: A systematic literature review was performed to identify clinical studies evaluating topical Mesna application during ear surgery (cholesteatoma or atelectasis). A qualitative analysis based on data extracted was conducted., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: From 27 articles, 5 retrospective studies were selected for a full analysis for a total of 607 patients (aged 5 to 72 years). Three studies evaluated cholesteatoma recidivism after Mesna application during cholesteatoma surgery, one study evaluated the surgical success rate of Mesna application for the treatment of atelectatic ears and adhesive otitis media, and one study evaluated potential ototoxicity of Mesna during cholesteatoma surgery. All the studies showed overall improvement in recurrence and residual cholesteatoma disease after Mesna application during surgery. Sensorineural hearing loss was not encountered after Mesna application., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Mesna application in cholesteatoma surgery could represent a valid and safe support tool during surgical treatment carried out both with microscopy and endoscopy. More studies are required to confirm these promising results.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The opioid epidemic is a significant public health crisis challenging the lives of North Americans. Interestingly, this problem does not exist to the same extent in Europe. Surgeons play a significant role in prescribing opioids, especially in the context of post-operative pain management. The aim of this study was to compare the post-surgical prescribing patterns of otologists comparing Canada and Austria., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: An online questionnaire was sent to 33 Canadian and 32 Austrian surgeons, who perform otologic surgery on a regular basis. Surgeons were asked to answer some questions about their background as well as typical prescribing patterns for postoperative pain medication for different ear surgeries (cochlear implant, stapedotomy, tympanoplasty). In addition, surgeons were asked about the typical use of local anesthetics for pain control at the end of a procedure. Otologists gave an estimate how confident they were that their therapy and prescriptions provide sufficient pain control to their patients., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Analysis of the returned questionnaires showed that opioids are more commonly prescribed in Canada than in Austria. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are used for postoperative pain more regularly after ear surgery in Austria, as opposed to Canada. Some of the prescribed drugs by European otologists are not available in North America. The use of local anesthetics at the end of surgery is not common in Austria. Surgeons' confidence that the prescribed pain medication was sufficient to control postoperative symptoms was higher in the group not prescribing opioids than in the group that did routinely prescribe opioids., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Prescribing patterns differ substantially between the two evaluated countries. This data suggests an opportunity to reduce opioid prescriptions after otologic surgeries. Studies to evaluate pain after these operations as well as efficacy of analgesics following ear surgery are an important next step.

With the investigators blinded, hemostasis was assessed with a modified Boezaart scale. Vasoconstriction was measured by laser Doppler. Blood pressure and pulse were tracked., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Thirty patients, 4 to 84 years old, were studied, with 15 patients per group. Boezaart scores dropped a mean of 67% and 62% with 1:1,000 and 1:10,000, respectively (P = .44). Capillary blood flow decreased a mean of 50.4% and 50.9% with 1:1,000 and 1:10,000, respectively (P = .95). The mean change in heart rate and mean arterial pressure after topical epinephrine exposure were -4.9 and -0.73 beats per minute (P = .15), and -0.60 and -0.73 mmHg (P = .96) for 1:1,000 and 1:10,000 respectively. No adverse events occurred in either group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Topical epinephrine at 1:10,000 has hemostatic efficacy comparable to 1:1,000 in tympanoplasty. Although both concentrations appear safe, use of topical epinephrine 1:10,000 should be considered over 1:1,000 to minimize the potential for adverse events., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 2 Laryngoscope, 131:2319-2322, 2021.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc..

N2  - Endoscopic middle ear surgery is a widely employed minimally invasive surgical technique to address middle ear and mastoid pathology. Bone drilling is the main technical challenge of endoscopic middle ear surgery. The accompanying video describes the detailed protocol of a constant-suction bone-drilling technique and the procedure of endaural exclusive endoscopic atticoantrotomy (retrograde mastoidectomy) using this technique. The main components of this bone-drilling technique include a soft and flexible suction tube, which is placed into the tympanic cavity to provide constant suction, and a soft sleeve, which is wrapped around the drill shaft to prevent the high-speed rotating shaft from damaging the lens of the endoscope. With these simple modifications, the traditional otological electrodrill can be used for drilling a tiny endaural incision in endoscopic middle ear surgery. Based on this bone-drilling technique, endaural endoscopic atticoantrotomy (retrograde mastoidectomy) can be successfully established for the removal of various amounts of bone, depending on the extent of the lesion. The short-term postoperative outcome seems promising.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the surgical training of residents. There is a real concern that trainees will not be able to meet their training requirements. Low-fidelity surgical simulation appears to be an alternative for surgical training. The educational benefits of repeating ossiculoplasty simulations under a microscope have never been evaluated. With this study we aimed to evaluate the differences in performance scores and on a global rating scale before and after training on an ossiculoplasty simulator., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In this quasi-experimental, prospective, single-centre, before-after study with blinded rater evaluation, residents performed five microscopic ossiculoplasty tasks with a difficulty gradient (sliding beads onto rods, the insertion of a partial prosthesis, the insertion of a total prosthesis, and the insertion of a stapedotomy piston under microscopic or endoscopic surgery) before and after training on the same simulator. Performance scores were defined for each task, and total performance scores (score/min) were calculated. All data were collected prospectively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Six out of seven intermediate residents and 8/9 novices strongly agreed that the simulator was an effective training device and should be included in the ENT residency program. The mean effect of training was a significant increase in the total performance score (+ 0.52 points/min, [95 % CI, 0.40-0.64], p < 0.001), without a significant difference between novice and intermediate residents., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: This preliminary study shows that techniques for middle-ear surgery can be acquired using a simulator, avoiding any risk for patients, even under lockdown measures.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the functional outcomes of ossiculoplasties. We conducted a retrospective study, in the department of ear, nose and throat (ENT) and congestive cardiac failure (CCF) at the University Hospital Mohammed VI, in Oujda, from October 2018 to March 2020. Out of 45 patients with secondary otitis, 30 had gone ossiculoplasty using endoscopic transmeatal approach. These patients were enrolled in the study. The average age of patients was 31.8 years, with a F/M sex ratio of 1.5. The examination of the eardrum showed type A otitis (18 cases) type B otitis (5 cases), type C otitis (3 cases) and type D otitis (4 cases), according to Austin classification; 70% of patients who had undergone surgery had hearing loss between 30 and 40 dB and 30% of patients had hearing loss of >=40 dB. Type II ossiculoplasty was performed in 26 cases, using tragal cartilage in 18 cases. Autologous incus interposition graft and placement of titanium PORP were performed in 4 cases each, whereas ossiculoplasty type III was performed in 4 cases, with placement of titanium TORP. Type II ossiculoplasty group had a hearing gain of >=20 dB (all cases), whereas type III ossiculoplasty group had a hearing gain of >=1 dB (1 case). Success rate was 90%. The analysis of these results shows that the overall outcome is slightly worse in patients undergoing type III ossiculoplasty than in those undergoing type II ossiculoplasty. However, comparative studies between the placement of prostheses and autografts or between different types of materials have only shown minor differences reported by the same author or the same team. Many authors highlighted that the preservation of the handle of malleus could provide better functional results.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright: Khalid Bouhafs et al.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study aims to explore the feasibility of endoscopic transcanal push-trough myringoplasty (ETPM) for all types of tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs), and compare the outcomes with those of endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasty (ETT) with meatal flap elevation., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A prospective, controlled study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In the present study, inpatients with TMPs were divided into two groups according to the manner of tympanic membrane repair: one group received ETPM without raising the meatal flap, and the other received ETT. The operation duration, postoperative healing rate, visual analogue scale (VAS) of pain, and complication rates were compared between these two groups., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Regardless of the size and location of the perforation, and its relationship with the malleus manubrium, myringoplasty can be completed using the ETPM method. The operation duration for different types of TMPs was shorter in the ETPM group than in the ETT group, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.05). However, there was no statistical difference in the short-term healing rate (p>0.05) and pain VAS score (p>0.05) between these two groups. Furthermore, no intraoperative or postoperative complications occurred in both groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: ETPM without raising the meatal flap can be applied for all types of TMPs, regardless of how large the perforation is, or where it is located. This can shorten the operation duration, and has a high healing rate comparable to ETT and mild postoperative pain. Mastering some essential surgical skills under the endoscope would be helpful to ensure the success of the surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Evaluate perception of preparedness for independent practice following the Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery residency program of Universite de Montreal., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Cross-sectional survey of graduates from the past 10 years. Participants were asked about their level of confidence at the end of their residency for various procedures using a 5-point Likert scale., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 7 out of 27 procedures were mastered by most physicians at the end of residency. The highest confidence level was in head and neck surgery (4 out of 5 procedures with a mean confidence level of 4 or higher) and lowest in laryngology and otology (both having 3 procedures with a median confidence level of 2 or less). The lowest confidence level was seen in ossiculoplasty and thyroplasty, being the only procedures to have a mean confidence level below 2. The highest scores were seen in superficial parotidectomy, direct microlaryngoscopy and trans-oral drainage of an abscess. These latter were the only procedures in which 100% of the respondent had a confidence level of 4 or 5., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION</ovid:b>: It has recently been suspected that these fields were potential weaknesses, so adjustments were made. This study provides new information to improves the curriculum. Recent and incoming change's impact on resident's confidence will be assessed in the future., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study highlights procedures and Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery subspecialties in which more surgical exposure or curriculum changes could increase resident's confidence and skills as part of a comprehensive Otorhinolaryngology practice.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Rehabilitation options for conductive and mixed hearing loss are continually expanding, but without standard outcome measures comparison between different treatments is difficult. To meaningfully inform clinicians and patients core outcome sets (COS), determined via a recognised methodology, are needed. Following our previous work that identified hearing, physical, economic and psychosocial as core areas of a future COS, the AURONET group reviewed hearing outcome measures used in existing literature and assigned them into different domains within the hearing core area., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Scoping review., <ovid:b>STUDY SAMPLE</ovid:b>: Literature including hearing outcome measurements for the treatment of conductive and/or mixed hearing loss., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The literature search identified 1434 studies, with 278 subsequently selected for inclusion. A total of 837 hearing outcome measures were reported and grouped into nine domains. The largest domain constituted pure-tone threshold measurements accounting for 65% of the total outcome measures extracted, followed by the domains of speech testing (20%) and questionnaires (9%). Studies of hearing implants more commonly included speech tests or hearing questionnaires compared with studies of middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: A wide range of outcome measures are currently used, highlighting the importance of developing a COS to inform individual practice and reporting in trials/research.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To assess the anatomical and functional outcomes of endoscopic transcanal tympanoplasty type I for tympanic membrane perforations., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Eight hundred thirty-five patients who underwent tympanoplasty between January 2011 and January 2019 were selected. Patients with tympanic membrane perforation treated with a transcanal endoscopic tympanoplasty type 1 and a follow-up period longer than 6 months have been retrospectively reviewed. The presence of cholesteatoma or ossicular chain dysfunctions were considered exclusion criteria. Eighty-one patients were included in the present study population. The main outcome was the rate of overall graft success. Secondary outcomes included hearing results. Prognostic factors related to both the abovementioned outcomes were assessed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Overall, 66 patients (81.5%) had a successful graft at the last follow-up evaluation. Mean follow-up was 22.1 (range 6-104) months. The anterior quadrants were entailed by the perforation in 62 (76.5%) cases. The overall success rate with cartilage (or cartilage and perichondrium) was 91.2% (p < 0.01). The median preoperative and postoperative ABG were 18.7 (13.4-25.6) and 7.5 (2.5-12.5), respectively, revealing a significant median improvement of 11.2 (p < 0.001). The type of graft and the postoperative tympanic membrane status were significantly associated with the audiologic outcome with p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Endoscopic tympanoplasty type I is a reliable technique with reasonable anatomic and audiologic results. Tympanic membrane grafting with cartilage (or cartilage and perichondrium) guarantees a higher rate of perforation closure and satisfactory hearing results. Anterior eardrum perforations can be successfully and safely managed with transcanal endoscopic approach avoiding postauricular approach and canalplasty.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> To assess and compare therapeutic effects and quality of life after endoscopic and microscopic myringoplasty using Chinese version of the Zurich chronic middle ear inventory(ZCMEI). <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Methods:</ovid:b> Patients with chronic suppurative otitis media underwent myringoplasty at the Third Hospital of Peking University from October 2018 to September 2019 were included in this study and divided into two groups: endoscopic tympanoplasty group(<ovid:i>n</ovid:i>=40) and microscopic tympanoplasty group(<ovid:i>n</ovid:i>=57). ZCMEI survey and pure tone audiometry were conducted preoperatively and 3-9 months postoperatively. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital, graft success rate, complication rate, hearing improvement and quality of life improvement were compared. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> 1The operation time, length of hospital and intraoperative blood loss of endoscopic group were significantly lower(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.05). 2The graft success rate was 92.5% and 98.2%, respectively(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>>0.05). The difference between the complication rate in two groups was not significant, but patients in endoscopic group had no symptoms of wound numbness or pain. 3Air conduction threshold(AC) and air-bone gap(ABG) were significantly lower after surgery in endoscopic group(<ovid:i>n</ovid:i>=33) and microscopic group(<ovid:i>n</ovid:i>=43). The analyzed result of generalized linear model indicated surgical approach had no influence on postoperative AC and ABG(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>>0.05). 4The total scores of ZCMEI were significantly improved in endoscopic group(<ovid:i>n</ovid:i>=32) and microscopic group(<ovid:i>n</ovid:i>=48) postoperatively, as well as the scores of ear symptoms, hearing and psychosocial impact(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.05). Preoperative and postoperative scores of medical resources were not significantly different in either groups(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>>0.05). Controlling the course of disease, the total ZCMEI results and scores of each subscale in patients with single ear involved(<ovid:i>n</ovid:i>=71) had no significant difference between two groups. <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> Endoscopic myringoplasty has the advantages of minimal invasiveness, short operation time, and quick recovery evaluated from subjective and objective aspects. Audiometry improvement, graft success rate, complication rate and quality of life improvements are comparable between endoscopic tympanoplasty and conventional microscopic tympanoplasty. The assessment of the quality of life is of great significance in efficacy evaluation of otitis media. Doctors should comprehensively consider patient's subjective experience and the objective improvement to obtain the best clinical efficacy.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright&#xa9; by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> To discuss the possible reasons for cholesteatoma recidivism after canal-wall-up mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty by analyzing clinical characteristics of patients. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Methods:</ovid:b> Data of 21 cases who suffered from cholesteatoma recidivism after canal-wall-up surgery were retrospectively reviewed, including preoperative examination, high resolution temporal bone CT, and intraoperative findings. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> 90.5%(19/21) cases had recurrent cholesteatoma with retraction pockets. Among 12 cases with previous operative notes, 66.7%(8/12) had extensive cholesteatoma which was not limited to attic in the original surgery. The intraoperative features of revision surgery in 21 patients including the destruction of reconstructive lateral attic wall and scutumwere found in 19.0%(4/21) cases, the head of malleus left in 19.0%(4/21) cases, the cholesteatoma found in hidden part in 14.3%(3/21) cases, the hadeustachian tube dysfunction in 38.1%(8/21)cases. the sclerotic mastoid in 42.9%(9/21) cases. hadanatomic variations of the temporal bone in 14.3%(3/21) cases and atresia of external auditory canal in 4.8%(1/21) cases. <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> In this group of recidivism cases, most patients had extensive cholesteatoma, which may lead to excessive mucosa loss during lesion clearance, poor ventilation of tympanic isthmus after surgery, and promote the formation of retraction pocket. In addition, some cases had eustachian tube dysfunction, unstable reconstruction of attic lateral wall, and improper selection of the indications, which may also increase the risk of recurrence. Therefore, in order to reduce cholesteatoma recidivism after canal-wall-up surgery, attention should be paid to the striction of surgical indications, comprehensive preoperative evaluation, thorough clearance of lesions and firm reconstruction.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright&#xa9; by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The main study endpoint was tolerance of stapedotomy under local anesthesia with sedation and under general anesthesia using stress and quality of life assessment questionnaires. Secondary endpoints comprised operative time and functional results., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHOD</ovid:b>: In a consecutive series of stapedotomy patients operated on over a 12-month period, quality of life and perioperative stress were analysed by 3 questionnaires: the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, Cohen's perceived stress scale and the Post-traumatic stress disorder checklist scale. Questionnaire responses and audiometric data were compared between groups treated under local anesthesia with sedation and under general anesthesia., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Twenty-two patients were included in the local anesthesia with sedation group and 6 in the general anesthesia group. There was no difference between the groups for quality of life, onset of post-traumatic stress, or perceived pre- and postoperative stress. There was also no difference in operative time. The audiometric data confirmed the reliability of stapedotomy. Stapedotomy under local anesthesia with sedation improved air conduction with<=10dB air-bone gap (ABG), comparable to results under general anesthesia. The rate of ABG<=10dB was 71.4%; no labyrinthisation was observed., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Under local anesthesia with sedation, stapedotomy was well tolerated without increasing the stress associated with otosclerosis surgery. By correcting hearing loss, the procedure improves quality of life.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Our study aimed to translate the chronic otitis media questionnaire-12 (COMQ-12) into the Arabic language, evaluate the internal consistency of the test and test-retest reliability, and validate the adaptation for further use in Arabic studies., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A prospective observation monocenter cohort study., <ovid:b>SETTINGS</ovid:b>: This study was done at Kafrelsheikh University Hospital, Egypt., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: One hundred twenty five ear pathology-free patients were asked to complete the questionnaire forming group A. One hundred twenty five patients with different forms of COM completed the questionnaire 2 weeks before the planned ear surgery and the same day of the operation, forming group B. Those patients who underwent the ear surgery, completed the questionnaire again 6 months after the operation forming group C., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: We did an Arabic forward and backward translation of the original COMQ-12. The patients in group B underwent ear surgery (tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy). After fulfilling the questionnaire in different groups, we assessed the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of COMQ-12: internal consistency, reliability, reproducibility, validity, and responsiveness., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Cronbach's alpha was 0.973. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 0.981, while the Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.973., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A statistically significant difference was present between group A (average total score 2.38 +/- 1.543) and group B (average total score 35.86 +/- 5.98). Also, there was a statistically significant difference between group B and group C (average total score 7.46 +/- 8.294). The calculated cut-off point of the total score was more than or equal to eight., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The cross-culturally Arabic adaptation of COMQ-12 was reliable, valid with strong internal consistency and responsiveness. It can detect the significant effect of COM on the quality of life of Arabic patients. This effect would be improved obviously after surgical management that markedly enhanced the preoperative hearing problem.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This is a qualitative study to explore the utility of gray-scale inversion or the "invert" function of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans in the diagnosis of temporal bone anatomy and pathology., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This is a case series describing an innovative application of an existing image processing tool to visualize temporal bone anatomy and pathology. Illustrative patients at a tertiary referral center with otologic symptoms and findings leading to HRCT scans of the temporal bone were included. Diagnostic HRCT scans were evaluated utilizing the gray-scale inversion function (invert function)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Nine illustrative cases which demonstrate conditions such as persistent stapedial artery, membranous stapes footplate, total ossicular prosthesis migration into the vestibule, third window syndrome such as superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) and cochlea-facial nerve dehiscence, otosclerosis, and ossicular chain discontinuity are included. The enhanced visualization was confirmed surgically in 3 cases, and 1 had physiological confirmation using cervical vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (cVEMP)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Gray-scale inversion can be used to improve visualization of temporal bone anatomy and pathologic changes when diagnoses are in doubt. The invert function is a useful adjunct in the armamentarium of both radiologists and otologists when evaluating HRCT of the temporal bone.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Understand opioid-prescribing patterns in otologic surgery and the difference in opioid use between transcanal and postauricular surgery., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective survey., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Multihospital network., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: All patients undergoing otologic surgery from March 2017 to January 2019., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Patients undergoing otologic surgery were surveyed regarding postoperative opioid use and their level of pain control. Patients were divided by surgical approach (transcanal vs. postauricular). Those who underwent mastoid drilling were excluded. Narcotic amounts were converted to milligram morphine equivalents (MME) for analysis., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Amount of opioid was calculated and compared between the two groups. Mann-Whitney U test and Chi-square testing were used for analysis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Fifty-five patients were included in the analysis; of these 18 (33%) had a postauricular incision. There was no difference in age (p = 0.85) or gender (p = 0.5) between the two groups. The mean amount of opioid prescribed (MME) in the postauricular and transcanal groups was 206.4 and 143 (p = 0.038) while the mean amount used was 37.7 and 37.5 (p = 0.29) respectively. There was no difference in percentage of opioid used (p = 0.44) or in patient-reported level of pain control (p = 0.49) between the two groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Patients in both the transcanal and postauricular groups used only a small portion of their prescribed opioid. There was no difference in the amount of opioid used or the patient's reported level of pain control based on the approach. Otologic surgeons should be aware of these factors to reduce narcotic diversion after ear surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2021, Otology & Neurotology, Inc.

N2  - Pulsatile tinnitus is an uncommon symptom characterized by a perceived sound pulsing like a heartbeat. Here, we report an unusual case of a patient with unilateral pulsatile tinnitus caused by a large, prominent mastoid emissary vein (MEV). A 45-year-old woman presented at our hospital with pulsatile tinnitus. She had persistent tinnitus for 20 years, and her symptoms had worsened in the previous 2 years. She said that she perceived a sound pulsing like a heartbeat. She had some hearing impairment in both the ears for a long time owing to long-term otitis media. The temporal bone computed tomography scan showed a large right jugular bulb, and there was a large MEV canal draining into the right sigmoid sinus. Therefore, we decided to perform a large MEV ligation with the planned right tympanoplasty. On follow-up, the patient's pulsatile tinnitus improved completely. According to reviews, this is the first reported case of surgical ligation of a large MEV as a treatment for pulsatile tinnitus; therefore, we report this case with a brief literature review.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess clinical and functional outcomes of a fat graft myringoplasty under local in an office setting., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective case series., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary care facility., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Patients with a tympanic membrane (TM) perforation presenting between December 2005 and June 2019. Inclusion criteria included perforation size >25% of the surface of the pars tensa of the TM, entire perforation margins visualized through a transcanal view, and lack of spontaneous closure at the 6-month follow-up. The exclusion criteria were the presence of cholesteatoma, wet appearance of the mucosa in the tympanic cavity, ear discharge in the 3 months before surgery, or signs of ossicular inconsistency., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: In-office fat graft myringoplasty technique under local anesthesia., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Complete perforation closure rate and audiometric outcomes., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 121 patients underwent the procedure, of whom 21 had bilateral sequential procedures (total 142 ears). Average age was 51.1 +/- 18.4 years (range, 3-78 years). The size of perforation was <25% of TM in 39 (27.5%) ears, 25% to 50% of TM in 49 (34.55%) ears, 50% to 75% of TM in 34 (23.91%) ears, and 75% to 100% of TM in 20 (14.10%) ears. Complete perforation closure was evident in 130 (91.55%) of the 142 ears. Preoperative mean air conduction threshold was 59.3 dB (17-95 dB) and significantly improved into 35.6 dB (10-85 dB; <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .0004) after surgery. Preoperative air-bone gap was 30.2 dB (5-70 dB) and also significantly improved into 10.2 dB (5-65 dB; <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .0001) after surgery., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In office fat graft myringoplasty, in adult and pediatric patients with variable perforation sizes, is a well-tolerated procedure with very satisfactory clinical results.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Different types of chronic middle ear disease (CMED) present with differing severity of single symptoms, such as discharge, vertigo or hearing loss, which impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Here, we aimed to (i) investigate characteristics of HRQoL and (ii) evaluate the association between HRQoL and hearing among different types of CMED., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we included adult patients undergoing surgical treatment for CMED. Primary outcomes included HRQoL assessed by the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21) and hearing assessed by pure-tone audiometry., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In the included 108 patients (51% females), CMED were chronic otitis media (COM) with (n = 46) or without (n = 22) cholesteatoma, persistent mastoid cavity (with [n = 15] or without [n = 10] recurrent cholesteatoma), revision ossiculoplasty for hearing restoration (n = 14), and postinflammatory meatal fibrosis (n = 1). Preoperatively, the mean ZCMEI-21 score showed statistically significant differences among different types of CMED (p = 0.007) with persistent mastoid cavity without cholesteatoma exhibiting the highest score (34.1, SD 7.7) indicating poor HRQoL. At a mean follow-up period of 183 days, no statistically significant differences in the ZCMEI-21 scores among different types of CMED were observed (p = 0.67)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study objectifies differences in HRQoL among different types of CMED. In patients with indication for functional surgery only, e.g., persistent mastoid cavity without cholesteatoma, the worst HRQoL was observed. Yet, in these types of CMED, HRQoL guides decision for treatment. Moreover, differences in HRQoL among different types of CMED were not closely associated with hearing, but largely depended on other symptoms, such as discharge or vertigo.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Nonautologous graft materials may solve several dilemmas in tympanoplasty by obviating the need for graft harvest, facilitating consistent wound healing, and permitting graft placement in the clinical setting. Prior studies of nonautologous grafts in humans have shown variable outcomes. In this systematic review, we aim to 1) summarize clinical outcomes and 2) discuss limitations in the literature regarding nonautologous grafts for tympanoplasty in humans., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A literature review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations. The study size, etiology and duration of perforation, type of nonautologous graft, and postoperative closure rate were assessed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The PRISMA approach yielded 61 articles, including 3,247 ears that met inclusion criteria. Studies evaluated nonautologous grafts including paper patch, gelatin sponge, growth factors, porcine small-intestinal submucosa, among others. Traumatic perforations (62.3%) were most commonly studied, whereas postinfectious perforations (31.9%) and other etiologies (5.8%) comprised a minority of cases. Acute perforations of <8 weeks duration constituted just over half of all treated ears. Overall closure rate was 82.1%, with significantly higher closure rates in acute (89.9%) versus chronic perforations (64.9%, P < .01), regardless of material. A median postoperative air-bone gap of 5.6 dB was found in the 23% of studies reporting this metric., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The majority of publications reviewing nonautologous materials in tympanoplasty evaluate acute or traumatic perforations, and few rigorously report hearing outcomes. Given available data, porcine submucosa and basic fibroblast growth factor may hold promise for chronic perforation closure. Future studies should report closure rates and hearing outcomes in perforations >8 weeks duration.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) has been increasingly adopted to enhance visualization during otologic surgery including pediatric cholesteatoma resection. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the current literature reporting rates of residual cholesteatoma to evaluate outcomes of EES in the pediatric population., <ovid:b>DATA SOURCES</ovid:b>: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane., <ovid:b>STUDY SELECTION</ovid:b>: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations (PRISMA), we systematically reviewed studies that reported outcomes for cholesteatoma surgery in children using the endoscope. Studies were included if they described the use of the endoscope for middle ear surgery and measured outcomes following cholesteatoma resection in pediatric patients., <ovid:b>DATA EXTRACTION</ovid:b>: Identified articles were assessed for study design, sample size, inclusion of pediatric population, the presence of a comparison group, outcomes measured such as: residual disease rate, recurrent cholesteatoma, audiologic outcome, quality of life measures, and complications., <ovid:b>DATA SYNTHESIS</ovid:b>: Fourteen articles in the literature discussed cholesteatoma outcomes in children when the endoscope was employed. Residual disease rate ranged from 0 to 22% when endoscope was used for dissection compared with 11 to 55% when endoscope was used for inspection or not at all. A meta-analysis was conducted on 11 studies. There was a significant risk reduction in residual disease rates for endoscopic dissection when compared with microscope (RR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.37-0.63, p < 0.001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Among the studies included in this review, EES was associated with lower rates of residual cholesteatoma compared with traditional microscopic techniques. Additional prospective studies are needed to further assess these findings.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: As tympanotomy using the transcanal approach was a routine surgical technique for traumatic ossicular disruption, the efficacy of the posterior tympanum approach was rarely explored., <ovid:b>AIM</ovid:b>: This study aimed to investigate whether the hearing outcomes improved after simultaneous ossiculoplasty and facial nerve decompression using the posterior tympanum approach compared with the transcanal approach., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The data of 11 patients who underwent ossiculoplasty and facial nerve decompression using the posterior tympanum approach and 21 patients who underwent ossiculoplasty <ovid:i>via</ovid:i> transcannal approach were analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The average air-bone gap (ABG) of patients undergoing posterior tympanotomy showed a statistically significant improvement. Postoperative ABG within 20 dB was observed in 81.8% of patients in the posterior tympanum group and 76.2% of patients in the transcanal group. However, the ABG closure in the two groups was not statistically different., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE</ovid:b>: Simultaneous ossiculoplasty using the posterior tympanum approach was practical, and the hearing outcomes were promising for the patients with traumatic facial nerve paralysis and ossicular disruption.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Chronic otitis media with anterior perforation is a challenging condition to treat with a microscope especially if the canal is narrow or has overhang. The endoscope provides the advantage of wide-angle view and transcanal access avoiding postauricular approach and canaloplasty., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare the anatomical, functional outcomes, and surgical duration between endoscopic and microscopic type-I tympanoplasty performed for anterior perforation., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A comparative study was conducted. The two groups, the microscopic (MT) and the endoscopic (ET) were created with 50 cases each and underwent type-I tympanoplasty. Results were evaluated at a minimum follow-up of 12 months., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The graft uptake rate in MT and ET was 81.8% and 91.3% respectively and was not statistically significant. The mean operative time for MT and ET was 68.68 +/- 18.79 min and 61.24 +/- 11.18 min respectively which was significant (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i>-.003). Endoscopic tympanoplasty significantly saved time. The difference in hearing outcomes was highly significant within the groups but not between the groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION AND SIGNIFICANCE</ovid:b>: The endoscopic tympanoplasty offered superior visualization avoiding postauricular incision and canaloplasty, with morphological and functional outcomes comparable to microscopic tympanoplasty. It offers significantly faster completion of procedure and provides minimally invasive surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE AND INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: To compare the efficacy of the inlay, composite chondroperichondrial clip (triple-C) tympanoplasty with conventional underlay cartilage island tympanoplasty, and to evaluate its efficacy in treating large, marginal perforations., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: The study involved 183 patients that were selected from a retrospective chart review of tympanoplasties performed at our center from March 2016 to June 2018., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: A tertiary referral center hospital., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: 65 patients underwent inlay, triple-C cartilage tympanoplasty (inlay group) and 118 underwent underlay cartilage island tympanoplasty (underlay group)., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Postoperative anatomical success rate, surgical time, hearing outcomes, and complications were analyzed. Focused analysis was performed on large or marginal perforations., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Both groups exhibited similar characteristics in demographic distribution, general health status, preoperative anatomical and hearing disabilities. Excellent results were achieved in both groups. Re-perforation occurred for 9.2% of the inlay group and 7.6% of the underlay group (p = 0.71). Hearing improvement was significant in both groups. Within the separate groups, 36% of underlay patients and 60% of inlay patients improved to achieve closure of the air-bone gap (ABG) to less than 10 dB (p = 0.1). In large or marginal perforations, both groups performed similarly. No significant complications were seen in this cohort. Nevertheless, a significant reduction in surgical time was observed in the inlay group (38 min. vs 58 min.; p = 0.0004)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Inlay triple-C tympanoplasty is comparable to conventional underlay cartilage island tympanoplasty in both anatomical and audiological success rates, even for large, marginal perforations. Due to its shorter operation time, inlay triple-C tympanoplasty should be considered a good surgical option for all tympanic membrane perforations.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Microscopic type-1 tympanoplasty (T1T) is a classical method for the treatment of chronic otitis media. However, it has its limitations. The development of otoendoscopy provided a new method for T1T., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To investigate the difference between endoscopic T1T and microscopic T1T., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Seventy-four patients who underwent T1T were evaluated retrospectively. About 52 cases underwent endoscopic T1T, and 22 cases accepted microscopic T1T. Parameters including operative duration, incision size, graft site, duration of postoperative hospitalization, visual analog scale (VAS) score, complications, hearing improvement, and expenses were compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Operative duration of endoscopic T1T (47.0 +/- 8.2 min) was shorter than microscopic T1T (58.0 +/- 9.3 min) (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .05). The VAS score under endoscopic T1T (1.5 +/- 0.2) was lower than microscopic T1T (5.6 +/- 0.4) (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .05). There was no complication during endoscopic T1T, but damage to the chorda tympani nerve (one case) was noted for microscopic T1T. There was no difference in hearing improvement between endoscopic (15.0 +/- 1.5 dB) and microscopic T1T (16.0 +/- 1.1 dB). Duration of postoperative hospitalization and expenses were lower for endoscopic T1T., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE</ovid:b>: Endoscopic T1T is a minimally invasive surgery with similar graft success rate, comparable hearing improvement, fast recovery, low cost, and high patient satisfaction compared to microscopic T1T.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to determine whether preoperative depressive symptoms influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after middle ear surgery in patients with chronic otitis media (COM)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This prospective clinical case study was conducted at a tertiary referral center. All 102 patients who had undergone middle ear surgery for COM were assessed clinically and by audiometric testing (pure tone audiometry) in pre- and postoperative settings. Disease-specific HRQOL was assessed by the validated chronic otitis media outcome test 15 (COMOT-15) and the Zurich chronic middle ear inventory (ZCMEI-21). General HRQOL was measured using the short form 36 (SF-36). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-D). The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was used to classify comorbidities. The middle ear status was determined using the ossiculoplasty outcome parameter staging (OOPS) index., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: After middle ear surgery, the total COMOT-15 and ZCMEI-21 scores improved significantly (p < 0.001). General HRQOL (total SF-36 score) was unaffected by surgery (p < 0.05). Patients without elevated depressive symptoms had significantly better total scores for the COMOT-15 (p < 0.01), ZCMEI-21 (p < 0.001), and for SF-36 (p < 0.001) postoperatively. The results of the multiple regression analyses show that, after adjusting for the OOPS, CCI, and hearing improvement, preoperative depressiveness was significantly associated with worse postoperative COMOT-15 and ZCMEI-21 outcome scores (beta = 0.425 and beta = 0.362, p < 0.001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Preoperative depressiveness was an essential predictive factor for HRQOL in patients with COM. This should be considered during patient selection to provide more suitable preoperative counseling.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020. The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:i>Introduction.</ovid:i> There are a few discussions regarding usefulness of an exoscope in otologic surgery compared to a traditional microscope. <ovid:i>Objective.</ovid:i> The pros and cons of using a newly developed exoscope (ORBEYE TM) during microotologic surgery were evaluated. <ovid:i>Methods.</ovid:i> The usefulness of the ORBEYE TM exoscope was retrospectively assessed in 6 otologic surgeries by 8 surgeons postoperatively. A questionnaire comprising 20 questions was designed and used for evaluation. <ovid:i>Results.</ovid:i> All the otologic surgeons agreed that the exoscope is useful as an educational tool; the exoscope had the highest score in the questionnaire (average: 4.75). The question "Will the ORBEYE<ovid:sup>TM</ovid:sup> exoscope replace the conventional tympanoplasty or stapes surgery?" had the lowest score (average: 3.13). <ovid:i>Conclusions.</ovid:i> The quality of the images and movies in the exoscope was considered to be high and improved; therefore, the exoscope was considered as a useful educational tool in otologic surgery. Similar to otologic endoscopic surgery, all the members such as the operator and assistants could head up and share 1 image.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the short-term (postoperative), medium-term (5 years), and long-term (10 and 15 years) audiometric results of patients who underwent stapedotomy and to determine specific factors associated with better postoperative outcomes., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This study is a retrospective case review of 486 ears with surgically confirmed stapes fixation who underwent microscopic small fenestra stapedotomy. Preoperative, postoperative, and medium- and long-term air conduction (AC), bone conduction (BC), and air-bone gap (ABG) were assessed. Postoperative factors associated with better postoperative outcomes were evaluated., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: At 10- and 15-year follow-ups, ABG, AC, and BC were significantly deteriorated but clinically preserved in comparison with postoperative results. According to a multiple quantile regression, younger age was associated with better postoperative results at 0.25 kHz (p = 0.003) and 4 kHz (p = 0.028) and a smaller preoperative ABG was associated with better audiometric results at 0.25 kHz (p = 0.048), 0.5 kHz (p = 0.001), and 4 kHz (p = 0.001). In addition, younger age (p = 0.001 for AC and p < 0.001 for BC) and preoperative AC PTA (p < 0.001 for AC) were significantly associated with better postoperative AC and BC PTA., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Stapedotomy surgery provides short-, medium-, and long-term hearing benefits in our studied cohort. ABG, AC, and BC thresholds obtained after the surgery are clinically preserved in 5-, 10-, and 15-year follow-ups, with an age-expected BC deterioration. Smaller preoperative ABG and younger age were positive predictors for better postoperative ABG. Future research should address long-term subjective and quality of life outcomes.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Congenital stapes fixation is characterized by congenital conductive hearing loss that is not progressive. This rare disease may be accompanied by additional middle ear anomalies. However, the occurrence of congenital stapes fixation with cleft palate and oligodontia was described by Gorlin et al. in 1973, and no further cases have been reported in the literature. Congenital stapes fixation was detected after the exploratory tympanotomy operation performed on a 15-year-old male patient admitted to our clinic with hearing loss, more prominent on the left. The patient also had a previous operation due to cleft lip and had congenital deficiencies in the upper and lower teeth. We present the second case report in the literature which we think belongs to this syndrome, which is defined as cleft palate, stapes fixation, and oligodontia syndrome by Gorlin et al.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate early results on hygiene, safety and functional outcome in a population undergoing a canal wall up technique with bony obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanic space (CWU-BOT) for extensive cholesteatoma, performed by a single surgeon. This study compares different techniques of tympanic membrane reconstruction, viz. allografts and autografts., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: A consecutive series of 61 ears with acquired cholesteatoma treated with primary or revision CWU-BOT surgery from 2009 to 2014., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Obliteration was performed by the use of cortical bone-chips and bone pate. Patients were followed up with micro-otoscopy and MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging. Ossicular reconstruction was performed using a remodelled autologous or allogenic incus or malleus., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Residual and recurrence rate and short- and mid-term hearing outcome prior to any revision tympanoplasty were analysed, the effect of type of tympanic membrane reconstruction was considered., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 44 Ears were primary cholesteatoma cases, 17 cases were referred for revision surgery. Mean postoperative follow up was 45 months (SD 18.08) and mean follow-up until the last non-EP DW MRI 42 months (SD 17.72). Recurrent disease was present in 3%, no residual disease was present. An AC gain was seen in 75% of all ears undergoing ossicular reconstruction., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Reproducible safety, hygiene and hearing results with limited recurrence and residual disease can be obtained by younger otologic surgeons performing the BOT-CWU for extensive cholesteatoma while using a variety of grafts for tympano-ossicular reconstruction. The tympano-ossicular allograft nevertheless shows superior hearing results when a mobile intact stapes is present., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: Level 4.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Inner ear malformations (IEMs) are common in children with hearing loss. The different types of IEMs form a unique subgroup of cochlear implant (CI) candidates. We aimed to evaluate the auditory perception outcomes of CI in children with different types of IEMs and compare them with CI users without IEMs., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The study included 274 CI users with and without IEMs as two groups (n = 137, each). Both groups' chronological age at implantation and duration of CI usage was matched (+/- 8 months). All subjects were evaluated pre-operatively and post-operatively by the Ling's sound test and the auditory perception test battery, which includes the Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale (MAIS), closed-set Pattern Perception Test (PPT) and open-set Sentence Recognition Test (SRT). Besides, children with IEMs were assessed for language development., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Progress in the IEMs' group differed according to the type of ear anomaly. CI users with enlarged vestibular aqueduct had the highest scores, while users with common cavity had the lowest. Children with IEMs performed well on the closed-set test while having difficulty with the open-set test., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Cochlear implantation outcomes are favourable in IEMs' patients with a cochlear nerve visible on magnetic resonance imaging. Our results indicate that it is critical to take the anatomical differences into account during follow-up and rehabilitation programmes. Each CI user should be evaluated according to his or her individual needs.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of the present study was to illustrate the learning curve of endoscopic type-1 tympanoplasty comparing experts in microscopic otology versus neophyte surgeons., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Eight ear surgeons, from tertiary referral centers, who had performed at least 30 endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasties were included in the study. Demographic data and medical records regarding the first 30 endoscopic type-1 tympanoplasties were retrospectively collected by each surgeon. A 14-questions survey focused on subjective aspects of the learning curve was administered. Surgeons were divided in two groups: one with previous experience in microscopic ear surgery (group 1) and one with no previous experience in ear surgery (group 2). The learning curve of endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasty was compared between the groups., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Mean surgical time was 89.2 min in group 1 vs. 79.5 min in group 2 (p < 0.01). When divided in 5 surgeries-steps, the only significant difference was appreciated in the first 5 surgeries with a longer mean time in group 1 vs. group 2 (+28.4 min; p < 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Surgeon's previous experience may influence the EES learning curve. Our results show that the first 5 surgical procedures are more challenging for surgeons experienced in microscopic surgery, subsequently the curve progression improves sharply and appears reversing the initial trend by the end of the 30 surgeries.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To describe and analyse functional treatment of temporal bone chondroblastoma (TBCh)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: From January 2000 to June 2019, at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Hopital Lariboisiere, Paris, France, patients with TBCh were enrolled in this study. All cases routinely performed pre-operatory work-up including evaluation of performance status, audio-vestibular function test, ear endoscopy, contrasted CT scan and MRI of head and neck region; in one case we also performed an angio-CT scan. All patients underwent resection of the tumour with a "functional" approach RESULTS: Three male patients (mean age 46,6 years)-two primary tumours and one recurrence-were treated. In all three cases the tumour invaded the middle ear with a variable degree of hearing loss and infiltration of temporal bone structures. All surgeries were performed with a microscopic approach associated with open/endoscopic approach when necessary. Inner ear and facial nerve were speared in all cases and the TMJ was partially resected in 2 cases due to its moderate involvement. At present, after a mean follow-up of 103 months (range 40-225 months), only one case presented recurrence which has been successfully treated with radiotherapy., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Our results of treatment suggest that functional surgery can be relevant in the management of TBCh since it is focused on both treatment of this pathology and maintenance of a good quality of life.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are a series of perioperative care to optimize preoperative preparation, prevent postoperative complications, minimize stress, and speedup recovery. Tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy are common surgical procedures for chronic suppurative otitis media., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare the efficacy and safety between ERAS and conventional recovery after surgery in the perioperative period of chronic suppurative otitis media., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: From April 2018 to February 2019, a total of 84 patients scheduled for tympanoplasty and/or mastoidectomy due to chronic suppurative otitis media were involved and randomly divided into the ERAS group and the control group. The patients' preoperative anxiety, postoperative pain, and comfort level were determined by comparing the results of Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and General Comfort Questionnaire (GCQ). The postoperative complications, postoperative hospital stay, and hospitalization cost were calculated., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The ERAS group showed a lower SAS score (30 [28-31.5] vs 35 [30-43], <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .05], a higher GCQ score (88 [84-100] vs 83 [78.25-92.25], <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .05), and a lower VAS score (0 [0-0] vs 1 [0-2], <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < .05] after surgery. No significant difference (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> > .05) was observed between the ERAS group and the control group in postoperative complications, postoperative hospitalization time, and hospitalization cost, respectively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Enhanced recovery after surgery can reduce pain and improve comfort in the perioperative period of chronic suppurative otitis media.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the safety and performance of three novel vibroplasty couplers that allow attachment of the floating mass transducer of a transcutaneous active middle ear implant (AMEI) to the round window (RW) membrane, the long process (LP), or the incus body and the short process (SP) of the incus., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Retrospective multicenter cohort study of 25 AMEI users with sensorineural or mixed hearing loss that were among the first implanted with an AMEI vibrating ossicular prosthesis in combination with the third generation of vibroplasty couplers between 2014 and 2016. Main Outcome Measures were bone-conduction pure-tone and vibroplasty thresholds, postoperative aided sound field thresholds and postoperative aided word recognition score (WRS)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Bone conduction threshold changes of more than 10 dB in 4PTA<ovid:sub>BC</ovid:sub> were observed in two subjects. A mean improvement of 57.8% in speech recognition was observed with a mean WRS at 65 dB SPL improving from 14.8% (SD 21.9%) preoperatively to a mean aided score of 72.6% (SD 18.6%). Sound field thresholds improved from an average 4PTA<ovid:sub>SF</ovid:sub> of 64.1 dB HL (SD 9.8 dB HL) to 37.0 dB HL (SD 8.9 dB HL), resulting in a mean functional gain of 27.1 dB. There was no significant difference in WRS or functional gain between the coupler types., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Initial experience shows that all three third generation vibroplasty couplers represent safe and efficient attachment options for the FMT allowing the surgeon to choose the coupling type based on the present pathology.

N2  - This study aims to determine the benefit of stapes surgery for otosclerosis in 121 patients with a mixed hearing loss and a preoperative bone conduction (BC) threshold >30 dB. Average postoperative air conduction (AC) improved from 61.5 dB to 34.3 dB. Average air-bone gap closed from 27.1 dB to 6.1 dB. Bone conduction improved from 34.3 dB to 28.2 dB, with 38% of patients achieving a postoperative AC of <30 dB. Glasgow Benefit Inventory scores showed significantly increased quality of life postoperatively in the 88 patients who responded to follow-up, with an average score of 56. There was a mean reduction in daily hearing aid use postsurgery of 5.48 hours, with 56% of patients who responded to follow-up questionnaire no longer needing to use one. When assessing suitability for stapes surgery, surgeons should consider that preoperative BC thresholds may be a poor indicator of the true cochlear reserve and therefore the potential for improvement in AC thresholds and quality of life.

N2  - In patients with inadequate hearing improvement after tympanoplasty and failure of conventional hearing aid fitting, active hearing implants provide an alternative treatment option. Active middle ear implants function as a vibromechanical bypass of the stiffness and damping effect of a poorly oscillating tympanic membrane and the (reconstructed) ossicular chain. The selection of the hearing system depends on the maximum output levels of the hearing system and the anatomical conditions in mostly multiply operated ears. The development of variable coupling elements for active middle ear implants led to an extension of the indications to include not only purely sensorineural hearing loss but also mixed and conductive hearing loss in patients, as the transducer can now be coupled to the (mobile) stapes or the round window membrane. The article provides an overview of current clinical study results and recommendations on the indications for active hearing implants in patients with chronic otitis media.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Chronic otitis media is a heterogeneous disorder. Chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma and, to a lesser extent, chronic otitis media with granulation lead to the destruction of bone structures within the middle ear. Bone loss may appear in the prominence of the horizontal semicircular canals and the bony canal of the facial nerve. The inflammatory process may spread to the bony labyrinth of the sigmoidal sinuses and the cranial cavities., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The analysis comprised the examination of fragments of auditory ossicles removed during surgery in 21 patients with various types of chronic inflammation of the middle ear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of scanning electron microscopy in evaluating the erosion of middle ear ossicles in different types of chronic otitis media. Images captured at various magnifications were used for the best possible illustration of the observed lesions in bone tissue., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The observed lesions and the degree of bone surface damage were dependent on the type of chronic inflammation of the middle ear. The largest destructive changes in the ossicular chain were observed in chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma; smaller changes were observed in chronic otitis media with granulation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In the case of damage to the ossicles inflicted by inflammation, the use of a modeled bone block made of a temporal bone taken from outside the tympanic cavity or a biomaterial prosthesis is a good choice in ossiculoplasty.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> To analyze the distribution of comorbid psychiatric disorders in patients with chronic otitis media associated tinnitus. <ovid:b>Method:</ovid:b> The data of patients with chronic otitis media associated tinnitus who accepted surgical treatments from July 2017 to September 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients accepted pure tone audiometry and acoustic conductance examination and were requested to fill the tinnitus history questionnaire, THI, TEQ, SAS, SDS and PSQI scales before operation. When the SAS or/and SDS score >=50 the patient was judged as having comorbid psychiatric disorders. When the PSQI score>6 the patient was judged as having comorbid sleep disorder, and then all the results were analyzed. <ovid:b>Result:</ovid:b> Sixty-two patients were included in the study, 43 cases were diagnosed as chronic suppurative otitis media, and 19 cases were diagnosed as middle ear cholesteatoma. The average course of chronic otitis media or middle ear cholesteatoma was(14.38+/-14.06) years, while the average course of tinnitus was(8.39+/-11.69) years. There were 32 cases with mild to moderate tinnitus(gradeI-II)(51.61%) and 30 cases with moderate to severe tinnitus(grade III-V)(48.39%). Before operation, there were 4 cases(6.45%) with normal hearing, 38 cases(61.29%) with conductive hearing loss, and 20 cases(32.36%) with mixed hearing loss. There was no significant difference in tinnitus severity between different hearing loss degrees and types(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>>0.05). The average SAS score was 45.10+/-11.61, and the average SDS score was 43.48+/-14.67, both higher than the normal modulus(30 points), among which 27 cases(44.00%) comorbid psychiatric disorders. The THI score in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders(57.85+/-21.1) was significantly higher than that in patients without comorbid psychiatric disorders(29.2+/-17.39)(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.05). The PSQI score in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders(8.86+/-3.47) was significantly higher than that of those without comorbid psychiatric disorders(6.24+/-2.54)(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.05). Fifty-three patients were followed up for 0.5 to 1.8 years after operation, and in 43 cases the tinnitus was reduced or disappeared after operation(the effective rate was 81.13%). There were no significant difference between patients in tinnitus relief group and those in tinnitus without relief group in age, sex, course of the disease, type of the disease, with or without comorbid psychiatric disorders and/or sleep disorder, postoperative hearing improvement. <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> Comorbid psychiatric disorders are common in patients with chronic otitis media associated tinnitus and the tinnitus in patients with comorbid psychiatric disorders is significantly more serious than that those without. For the treatment of chronic otitis media associated tinnitus, besides surgery, the complications such as psychiatric and sleep disorders and so on should be evaluated and treated accordingly.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright&#xa9; by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To investigate the association between the "ChOLE" classification, hearing outcomes and disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQoL)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In two tertiary referral centers, patients requiring primary or revision surgery for cholesteatoma were assessed for eligibility. Audiometric assessment was performed pre- and postoperatively. The ChOLE classification was determined intraoperatively and via the preoperative CT scan. HRQoL was assessed pre- and postoperatively using the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 87 patients (mean age 45.2 years, SD 16.2) were included in this study. ChOLE stage I cholesteatoma was found in 8 (9%), stage II cholesteatoma was found in 65 (75%), and stage III cholesteatoma was found in 14 (16%) patients. Postoperatively, the mean air-bone gap (0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz) was significantly smaller than before surgery (14.3 dB vs. 23.0 dB; p = 0.0007). The mean ZCMEI-21 total score significantly decreased after surgery (26.8 vs. 20.7, p = 0.004). No correlation between the ZCMEI-21 total score and both the ChOLE stage and the extent of the cholesteatoma (ChOLE subdivision "Ch") was found. A trend towards worse HRQoL associated with a poorer status of the ossicular chain (ChOLE subdivision "O") was observed. The audiometric outcomes were not associated with the extent of the cholesteatoma. The ChOLE subdivision describing the ossicular status showed a strong association with the pre- and postoperative air conduction (AC) thresholds. Further, the ZCMEI-21 total score and its hearing subscore correlated with the AC thresholds., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The ChOLE classification does not show a clear association with HRQoL measured by the ZCMEI-21. The HRQoL neither seems to be associated with the extent of the disease nor with the ossicular chain status. Yet, surgical therapy significantly improved HRQoL by means of reduced ZCMEI-21 total scores, which were strongly associated with the AC thresholds. Intraoperative assessment of a cholesteatoma using the ChOLE classification and HRQoL complement each other and provide useful information.

N2  - To limit functional surgical failure and reduce the rate of revision surgery in case of surgical ossicular chain reconstruction, a piezoelectric device was developed for assessment of ossicular chain vibrations during the middle ear surgery. The device resembled a pen and consisted of a reusable main body and a disposable sensitive head including piezoelectric polymer sensor. Almost all of components of the device were made of polymer for light weight and for acoustic impedance matching to the middle ear system. Several frequencies can be analyzed simultaneously and several measures can be taken by time. The results showed that the device can record normal and reconstructed ossicular chain vibration in response to an acoustic stimulation, with similar results to those achieved by laser Doppler vibrometer. This light, handheld and low-cost device allows fast, easy and safe assessments of normal ossicular chain mobility and ossicular chain reconstruction efficiency. Primary pre-clinical trial showed very promising performance of the device that could be used to qualitatively control ossiculoplasty during real-time surgical procedure. Clinical assessments will be done to further evaluate the real-life performance of the device.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Tympanic membrane perforations must be closed with surgery; however, most surgical procedures are considerably invasive in nature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of minimally invasive myringoplasty using platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and an atelocollagen sponge for closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforations, as well as to identify the factors affecting the surgical outcome., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The records of 118 patients who underwent surgical closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforation at an ear-nose-throat clinic were reviewed retrospectively. After removing the margin of the perforation via a transcanal approach under local anesthesia, an atelocollagen sponge injected with PRP was inserted into the perforation as a scaffold. If the size of the perforation decreased after the surgery, the same surgical procedure was repeated. The success rate of closure after the last surgery was evaluated in terms of the size of the perforation. In addition, the relationships of the success rate with the cause and duration of perforation and patient age were also examined., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The perforation was closed after initial or repeat surgeries in 95.8% (68/71) of cases with small-sized perforations, 80.0% (32/40) of cases with middle-sized perforations, and 85.7% (6/7) of cases with large-sized perforations. Multiple surgeries (up to four times) were required for middle- and large-sized perforations, and even for some small-sized perforations. The number of re-operations required for closure significantly increased with increase in the size of the perforation (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.01). The cause and duration of perforation were not predictors of the surgical outcome. However, patient age was a significant predictor of the surgical outcome; patients older than 80years had a significantly worse success rate than younger patients (Fisher's exact test, p<0.01)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Minimally invasive myringoplasty using PRP has a satisfactory success rate even for large-sized tympanic membrane perforations. PRP is autologous and its use is non-toxic and safe. Although informed consent from the patient is necessary for the repetition of the surgery and for patients older than 80years, this technique appears to be a promising office-based procedure for closure of chronic tympanic membrane perforations.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: It is generally thought that the recovery of damaged chorda tympani nerve (CTN) function after middle ear surgery is different in pediatric patients from that in adult patients. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes and the progress of taste and somatosensory functions of the tongue after middle ear surgery in pediatric patients compared with those of adult patients., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Fifty-nine pediatric patients and 106 adult patients underwent middle ear surgery. Taste and somatosensory functions of the anterior tongue, the so-called CTN functions, were assessed using electrogustometry (EGM), a 2-point discriminator, an electrostimulator, and a questionnaire before and 2 weeks and 6 months after surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Two weeks after surgery, there was no significant difference in the incidence of dysgeusia and abnormal EGM thresholds between the patient groups. The incidence of tongue numbness was significantly lower in pediatric patients than in adult patients regardless of CTN manipulation. Although the lingual somatosensory thresholds of adult patients were significantly increased, those of pediatric patients were not increased. Six months after surgery, the incidences of dysgeusia and an abnormal EGM threshold were lower in pediatric patients than in adult patients. Tongue numbness disappeared, and the thresholds of lingual somatosensory tests returned to normal in most pediatric patients., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Not only taste function but also lingual somatosensory function was damaged after middle ear surgery even in pediatric patients. Pediatric patients complained of tongue numbness less frequently and showed earlier recovery than adult patients., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 2 Laryngoscope, 130:1016-1022, 2020.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

Two study protocols were completed by the surgeon, and a questionnaire was distributed to each patient 1 year after surgery. A total of 832 patients operated on during 2013 to 2016 were included. Pure-tone audiometry was performed preoperatively and 1 year after surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There was no significant difference in postoperative high-frequency hearing thresholds among the subgroups at the 1-year follow-up. The CO<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> + drill laser group had the best hearing outcome according to the following criteria: air-bone gap closure <=10 dB, air-conduction improvement >20 dB, and bone conduction not worsened >5 dB. The overall complication rate was low in all analyzed groups. The most commonly reported symptom after surgery was newly developed or worsened tinnitus (6%). Subjective hearing 1 year after surgery was reported to be better or much better in 91% of the patients., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The combination of a drill and CO<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> laser or a drill and potassium-titanyl-phosphate laser resulted in the best hearing outcome in this study from the SQOS.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To delineate the advantages and steps of stapedotomy with incus vibroplasty, to assess the safety and efficacy of this method via the authors' experiences, and to overview the literature regarding other surgical options in advanced otosclerosis determining the place of stapedotomy with incus vibroplasty in the therapeutic range., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Four patients were enrolled in the study presenting severe mixed hearing loss of at least one side on pure tone audiometry. Based on complementary audiological examinations including stapedial reflex test and multifrequency tympanometry, all cases were suspected as advanced otosclerosis. Stapedotomy with incus vibroplasty - the combination of laser stapedotomy and simultaneous Vibrant Soundbridge implantation - was performed in each patient. Preoperative pure tone average, speech recognition thresholds and word recognition scores were compared to one-year postoperative free-field values with the implant switched on focusing on functional gain., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Among 4 participants (3 females, 1 male) the mean age (SD) was 66 years (35). In three cases Nitinol, in one case NitiBond piston was inserted. One-year postoperative free-field functional gains were 30 dB, 34 dB, 42 dB and 51 dB, respectively. One-year postoperative free-field speech recognition thresholds were 45 dB, 45 dB, 49 dB and 50 dB, respectively, while word recognition scores were 70%, 70%, 70% and 75%, respectively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Postoperative results in our serie regarding pure tone average and word recognition score proved to be better than those found in the literature. Stapedotomy with incus vibroplasty - through sufficient air-bone gap closure and simultaneous sensorineural component management - seems to be a promising surgical solution in advanced otosclerosis, requiring further investigation.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Microsurgery of the ear requires complete evaluation of middle ear surgical anatomy, especially the posterior tympanic cavity anatomy. Preoperative assessment of the middle ear cavity is limited by the permeability of eardrum and temporal bone density. Therefore, middle ear exploration is an extremely useful method to identify structural abnormalities and anatomical variations., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study is to determine anatomic variations of the middle ear in an autopsy series., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: All evaluations were performed in the Forensic Medicine Institute Morgue Department. The cases over 18 years of age, with no temporal bone trauma and history of otologic surgery included in this study., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: One hundred and two cadavers were included in the study. The mean age was 49.08+/-17.76 years. Anterior wall prominence of the external auditory canal was present in 27 of all cadavers (26.4%). The tympanic membrane was normal in 192 ears (94%) while several eardrum pathologies were detected in 12 ears (6%). Agenesis of the pyramidal eminence and stapedial tendon was found in 3 ears. While the ponticulus was bony ridge-shaped in 156 of 204 ears (76.4%), it was bridge-shaped in 25 ears (12.3%). The ponticulus was absent in 23 ears (11.3%). While complete subiculum was present in 136 of all ears (66.7%), incomplete subiculum was present in 21 ears (10.3%). Subiculum was absent in 47 ears (23%). Facial dehiscence was found in 32 ears and the round window niche was covered by a pseudomembrane in 85 ears (41.6%). A fixed footplate was present in 7.4% of all ears, and no persistent stapedial artery was seen in any cases., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The pseudomembrane frequency covering the round window niche was found different from reports in the literature. In addition, the frequency of the external auditory canal wall prominence has been reported for the first time.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess the usefulness of numeric grading scales of middle ear risk in predicting ossiculoplasty hearing outcomes., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective review., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary care, academic medical center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Adults and children undergoing ossiculoplasty between May 2013 and May 2019 including: synthetic ossicular replacement prosthesis, autograft interposition, bone cement repair, and mobilization of lateral chain fixation., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Cases were scored via middle ear risk index (MERI), surgical prosthetic infection tissue eustachian tube (SPITE) method, and ossiculoplasty outcome scoring parameter (OOPS) scale. Preoperative and postoperative hearing outcomes were recorded., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: Statistical correlation between risk score and postoperative pure-tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The 179 included cases had average pre and postoperative PTA-ABGs of 30.3dB (standard deviation [SD] 12.7) and 20.3dB (SD 11.1), respectively. Mean MERI, SPITE, and OOPS scores were 4.5 (SD 2.3), 2.8 (SD 1.7), and 3.1 (SD 1.8), respectively. Statistically significant correlations with hearing outcome were noted for all three methods (MERI r = 0.22, p = 0.003; OOPS r = 0.19, p = 0.012; SPITE r = 0.27, p < 0.001). No scale predicted poor (PTA-ABG > 30dB) outcomes; only low SPITE scores predicted excellent (PTA-ABG < 10dB) outcomes (odds ratio [OR] 0.74 [Confidence Interval: 0.57 - 0.97], p = 0.032)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Significant weak correlations between each middle ear risk score and hearing outcomes were encountered. Although only the SPITE method predicted postoperative PTA-ABG, it was not overwhelmingly superior. Current grading scale selection may be justified by familiarity or ease of use.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> To compare the therapeutic effect of otoendoscopic tympanoplasty with acellular dermal allograft(AlloDerm) and tragus cartilage perichondrium. <ovid:b>Method:</ovid:b> 121 patients who underwent type I tympanoplasty under otoscope were retrospectively analyzed. According to the grafts used, they were divided into two groups: AlloDerm group (56 cases) and tragus cartilage perichondrium group (65 cases). The operative time, postoperative tympanic membrane healing rate, and hearing recovery were compared between two groups. The follow-up time was twelve months. <ovid:b>Result:</ovid:b> The operative time in the AlloDerm group were lower than those in the tragus cartilage perichondrium group(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.05). The successful closure rates between the acellular dermal allograft group and tragus cartilage perichondrium group at 1-month follow-up were 92.86% and 92.31% respectively, while the closure rates between two groups at 6-month follow-up were drop to 91.07% and 90.77% respectively, the closure rates between two groups at 12-month follow-up were also 91.07% and 90.77% respectively,the was no statistically difference between two groups(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>>0.05). The difference in pre-and post-operative air bone gap(ABG) values between two groups was no statistically significant(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>>0.05). <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> Both the AlloDerm and the tragus cartilage perichondrium tympanoplasty can achieve satisfactory healing rate of the tympanic membrane and audiologic improvement. However, AlloDerm has a short operation time, no need to obtain materials and less trauma, and is worth of promotion and application.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright&#xa9; by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to evaluate both audiological and tinnitus related results in patients with tinnitus undergoing ossicular chain reconstruction (OCR) for ossicular chain injury., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Between January 2015 and January 2019, patients who underwent OCR due to ossicular chain pathology and developed tinnitus symptoms were included in the study group. Middle ear pathologies were standardized using the middle ear risk index (MERI) scoring system and the tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) was used to determine the severity of tinnitus. The surgical methods used for reconstruction were partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) or total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP), depending on the patient's pathology., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The study group consisted of 43 patients aged between 34 and 65 years. Mean MERI score of the patients was 6.42 +/- 2.52. When assessed categorically, 18.6% of the study group was identified in the 'mild', 46.5% were in the 'moderate', and 34.5% were in the 'severe' MERI category. Patients in the TORP group and those who were undergoing second session OCR had higher MERI and preop THI scores. Post-operative tinnitus levels were higher in patients who had OCR in the second session and were in the severe risk group. The ABG and tinnitus scores of patients were found to improve with OCR. In patients who underwent TORP, both ABG and tinnitus scores decreased significantly. Whereas, in patients who underwent PORP, only ABG values decreased significantly. After OCR, both ABG value and tinnitus scores significantly decreased compared to pre-operative results. ABG recovery rate was 100% in the study group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: It can be said that OCR positively changes both audiological parameters and tinnitus levels in ossicular chain pathologies.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Asymmetric hearing loss is generally defined as a moderate-to-profound hearing loss in the poorer ear and a mild-to-moderate hearing loss in the better ear. Application of a bone conduction hearing aid is one of the possible treatments for the poorer ear in asymmetric hearing loss. However, the device essentially stimulates the contralateral better ear, precluding true binaural hearing. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the application and utility of bone-anchored hearing aids in the treatment of asymmetric hearing loss., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: We retrospectively evaluated 215 implanted subjects in our clinic and extracted a series of 27 patients affected by asymmetric hearing loss and treated with bone-anchored hearing aids. All 27 subjects had a mixed hearing loss after middle ear surgery. The preoperative and postoperative audiological data of these patients were collected and analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The audiological tests showed an improvement in the performance of hearing perception of sound and speech in quiet and noise. Moreover, the subjects have positively answered the questionnaires administered to evaluate subjective benefits. All subscales of the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit and speech, spatial, and qualities of hearing scale showed a significant improvement with the device., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Bone-anchored hearing aids are a suitable treatment for asymmetric hearing loss. When other devices cannot be utilized or are not indicated, the bone conduction devices may allow good audiological results.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty (IBCT) is a simple grafting technique. Endoscopy facilitates visualization by eliminating blind spots. We analyzed the outcomes of IBCT using both endoscopic and microscopic approaches, and assessed how trainees perceived the educational opportunities afforded., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Sixty patients who underwent IBCT were allocated to Group I (n = 30; microscopic IBCT) and Group II (n = 30; endoscopic IBCT) by the dates of their visits. Anatomical success was defined as an intact, repaired tympanic membrane; functional success was defined as a significant decrease in the air-bone gap. Postoperative discomfort was analyzed using a visual analog scale (VAS). Thirteen trainees completed structured questionnaires exploring anatomical identification and the surgical steps., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The surgical success rates were 96.7% in Group I and 100% in Group II. We found no between-group differences in the mean decrease in the air-bone gap or the extent of postoperative discomfort. Significant postoperative hearing improvements were evident in both groups. The mean operative time was shorter when the microscopic approach was chosen (17.7+/-4.53 vs. 26.13+/-9.94 min). The two approaches significantly differed in terms of the identification of external and middle ear anatomical features by the trainees, and their understanding of the surgical steps., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Both endoscopic and microscopic IBCT were associated with good success rates. The endoscopic approach facilitates visualization, and a better understanding of the middle ear anatomy and the required surgical steps and thus is of greater educational utility.

N2  - <b> Introduction: </b>Chronic otitis media is characterized by tympanic membrane perforation and conductive hearing loss. In the active form of this disease, there will also be periodic or permanent otorrhea. With a number of surgical techniques available depending on intraoperative findings, otosurgery is the treatment of choice in such cases, the extent of which depends on the type and extent of the pathological changes. <br><b>Material and <ovid:br/>Method: </b> We carried out an analysis of 79 patients with chronic otitis media undergoing surgery at the Department of Otolaryngology, Jagiellonian University Medical College in Krakow between 2005 and 2014. Total audiometry was used as a part of hearing assessment, before the surgery, 6 months after the surgery and in the distant 10-year observation period. In addition, each patient completed the questionnaire and was examined by an otolaryngologist. <br><b> Results: </b> The analysis included 79 patients operated on due to chronic otitis media. The mean bone conduction (for frequencies 500,1000 and 2000 Hz) before surgery was 31.8 dB, it did not differ significantly (p = 0.355) after 6 months after surgery (32.8 dB), while it significantly increased (p < 0.001) in a distant 10-year control of 43.4 dB. The mean air conduction (for frequencies 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz) before the procedure was 57.6 dB, it significantly improved in the early control by 50.5 dB, at p < 0.001. In long-term follow-up it increased again to 61.3 dB and was significantly different from the early postoperative period (p < 0.001). The mean air-bone gap for frequencies 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz before surgery was on average 26.4 dB, it was significantly (p < 0.001) reduced in the postoperative period by 17.6 dB. The level of air-bone gap remained at a similar level in distant control. <br><b>Conclusions:</b> (1) A completely preserved ossicular chain in the absence of active chronic otitis media is the best prognosis for stable hearing improvement over the years with normal inner ear function; (2) Reoperation worsens the long-term results of a hearing test compared to the first operation.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to assess change in temperature, audiometric outcomes and post-operative complications following exposure to different light sources during endoscopic ear surgery., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: A total of 64 patients diagnosed with chronic otitis media with central perforation and pure conductive hearing loss underwent endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasty. The patients were randomised into two groups based on the light source used: xenon or light-emitting diode. Temperature was measured using a K type thermocouple at the promontory and round window niche. Mean temperature change with respect to operating time, mean audiometric change, incidence of vomiting in the first 24 hours, vertigo and tinnitus at the end of the first week were observed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Mean temperature change showed a statistically significant difference with increasing length of operating time with the xenon light source and when the two light sources were compared for a particular time interval. Mean audiometric change showed statistically significant deterioration at higher frequencies (4, 6 and 8 kHz) with the xenon light source but only at 8 kHz for the light emitting diode source. When the mean audiometric change was compared between light sources for a particular frequency, statistical significance was found at 4, 6 and 8 kHz. Post-operative complications were vomiting, vertigo and tinnitus (p-values of 0.042, 0.099 and 0.147, respectively, between two groups)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Light emitting diodes are associated with less significant middle-ear temperature rises and audiometric changes at higher frequencies when compared to xenon light sources. Hence, xenon should be replaced with cooler light sources.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Tympanic membrane perforations might have a negative impact on the patient's quality of life, especially in the pediatric population. Surgery is therefore often required. The most adequate age for surgery remains unclear and is debated in the current literature. The aim of this study was to investigate outcomes of type I tympanoplasty in children and examine the impact of age on surgical outcome., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Retrospective cohort study. All patients under the age of 18 undergoing type I tympanoplasty at Regional Hospital West Jutland, Denmark, from 1/1-2013 to 31/12-2017 had their medical files reviewed. The primary endpoint of interest was tympanic membrane closure rate six months following surgery, i.e. surgical success. Secondary outcomes were air-bone-gap reduction and the correlation between age and surgical success., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 180 patients undergoing 197 procedures met the predefined criteria. Age at the time of surgery ranged between five and 17 years. Mean age at the time of surgery was 10.1 years (95% CI 9.1-11.2). Surgical success was achieved in 91,3% of the cases. No correlation between age and surgical success was found. Mean air-bone gap was reduced from 19.8 dB (95% CI 18.5-21.0) preoperatively, to 6.9 dB (95% CI 6.1-7.7) at follow-up, p < 0.05. Air-bone gaps <=10 dB at follow-up were achieved in 155 of the cases (78.6%). Postoperative infection seemed to increase the risk of surgical failure, RR 2.80 ((95% CI 1.06-7.38), p = 0.037)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Type 1 tympanoplasty in children is an effective treatment in terms of achieving an intact tympanic membrane and improved hearing. No correlation could be found between age and surgical success. Postoperative infection influences surgical outcome negatively.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: After tympanoplasty, it is often challenging to differentiate between different causes of a remaining air bone gap (ABG). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) offers a new approach for combined morphologic and functional measurements of the tympanic membrane and adjacent parts of the middle ear. Thus, it provides valuable diagnostic information in patients with a reduced sound transfer after middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>PATIENT AND INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: A patient with history of tympanoplasty and a persistent ABG was investigated with endoscopic OCT before revision surgery., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: The oscillation behavior and the thickness of the reconstructed tympanic membrane was determined. The oscillation amplitudes of the inserted prosthesis were compared to a finite element model simulation and to the clinical findings and the audiometric data of the patient., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: OCT measurements showed a reduced oscillation amplitude of the prosthesis while revealing an aerated middle ear and good coupling of the prosthesis. Transfer loss measured by OCT showed a similar progression as the ABG measured by pure-tone audiometry with a mean divergence of 4.45 dB., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic OCT is a promising tool for the evaluation of tympanoplasty outcome. It supports established otologic diagnostics and can help differentiating between different causes of conductional hearing loss.

N2  - <b>Introduction: </b>Knowledge about the physiology of a healthy middle ear is essential for understanding the activity and mechanics of the ear as well as the basics of ossiculoplasty. Trauma of the epithelial lining of the tympanic cavity as well as the ossicular chain may be the result of chronic inflammation and surgery. Depending on the observed changes of the middle ear lining, there are several types of distinguished chronic inflammatory changes: simple, with cholesteatoma, with the formation of inflammatory granulation tissue, in course of specific diseases. <br><b>Purpose: </b>The aim of the article is presentation of the microstructure and vasculature of the ossicular chain in the Scanning Electron Microscope. Particular attention is drawn to the anatomical aspects of the structure and connections of auditory ossicles as vital elements for reconstruction of the conduction system of the middle ear. <br><b>Material and method: </b>The analysis covered auditory ossicles standardly removed in accordance with the methodology of the investigated surgical procedures. The preparations were evaluated in a scanning electron microscope. <br><b>Results: </b>The exposure of bone surface promotes deep erosion. The advanced process of destruction of bone surface in the case of chronic otitis media correlates with a significant degree of damage to both the lining covering the auditory ossicles and that surrounding articular surfaces. <br><b>Conclusions: </b>(1) The ossicles in the image of the Scanning Electron Microscope are covered with lining. It passes from the surface of the ossicles to the vascular bundles, forming vascular sheaths; (2) Damage to lining continuity on the surface of the auditory ossicles promotes the rapid destruction of bone tissue in the inflammatory process; (3) The dimensions of the individual ossicles are respectively: malleus - 8.36 +/- 0.01, incus - 8.14 +/- 0.0, stapes - 3.23 +/- 0.01 mm. Behavior of the anatomical length of ossicular chain during tympanoplasty appears to be essential to maintaining adequate vibration amplitude of the conductive system of the middle ear.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND AND AIM</ovid:b>: Tympanoplasty is a common surgery in otorhinolaryngology field. In majority of procedures, in addition to the graft used for closure of tympanic membrane, a packing material is essential to be placed in the middle ear cavity. The main goals of packing can be summarized as providing support to the tympanic membrane and ossicular grafts, aeration of middle ear cavity and hemostasis. Several packing materials are currently available for using in middle ear surgeries. Each agent is associated with particular advantages and disadvantages, so choosing the proper packing agent is essential in tympanoplasty surgeries. In this study we aimed to compare two common packing materials (Gelfoam and silastic sheets) in cartilage tympanoplasty surgeries., <ovid:b>METHODS AND MATERIALS</ovid:b>: In this block-randomized clinical trial, 78 patients undergoing tympanoplasty in Vali-e-asr hospital in 2017 and 2018 were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to silastic sheet or gelfoam groups. The functional outcomes were compared between the groups. Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Success was achieved in 32 (82.1%) patients and 34 (87.2%) patients in gelfoam and silastic sheets' groups, respectively (p = 0.530). The perforation area percentage was significantly lower (P = 0.007) in Gelfoam group. The other parameters were statistically the same in both groups (P > 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Overall, Gelfoam and silastic sheet methods had similar efficacy in cartilage tympanoplasty. Using each method depends on the preferrence of surgeon and patients' characteristics. Multi-center studies with larger sample sizes are needed for more conclusive results.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - Temporal bone cancer is extremely rare; thus, the optimal surgical strategy for advanced tumors, en bloc vs piecemeal resection, remain controversial. Some authors have favored piecemeal resection and reported comparable outcomes.1 Other authors recommend the use of en bloc subtotal temporal bone resection (STBR) for advanced tumors and reported better outcomes, although long-term cancer control remains uncertain.2 Because of the technical difficulty and the lack of demonstrative surgical videos, STBR has not been sufficiently distributed. This video demonstrates en bloc STBR in a stepwise manner with particular focus on the neurosurgeon's role and aims to improve its safety, feasibility, and distribution. This video conforms to the description of Osawa et al3 in the designations for each segment of the petrous ICA. A 67-yr-old man suffered from consistent otorrhea and underwent tympanoplasty at an outside hospital 1 yr earlier. Following a histopathological diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma in the specimen, he underwent chemoradiotherapy (cisplatin + 70 Gy). However, a current imaging revealed a recurrent tumor and he was admitted to our hospital for radical resection. Computed tomography revealed a disrupted external auditory canal and magnetic resonance imaging indicated a carcinoma equivalent to Pittsburg stage T3. The patient underwent radical STBR without complications. His postoperative course was uneventful. At 2 yr postoperative, his modified Rankin scale score was 1, no recurrence was noted, and his facial nerve function was restored to House-Brackmann Grade IV. This video was reproduced with informed consent from the patient.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 by the Congress of Neurological Surgeons.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The aim of the present study was to compare the postoperative morbidity and cosmetic results between the use of the scapha and the use of the tragus as the auricular cartilage graft donor site in patients who had undergone cartilage tympanoplasty. The fascia graft was used as the control., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The patient's visual symmetry, cosmetic satisfaction, and anthropometric measurements were studied to objectively evaluate the cosmetic condition. The formation of skin scar changes, pigmentation changes, and sensory changes as clinical criteria were compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 234 patients and their 257 operated ears were included in the study. Forty prospectively operated ears with preoperative findings were also included. All patients (100%) felt that their results were good, as indicated by the visual analog scale, and the anthropometric ear measurements used to reinforce the data showed no significant differences between the groups. A significant difference with respect to clinical sensory changes was found between the groups only in patients undergoing unilateral surgery via the retro auricular approach (p<0.05). There was no difference between the scapha and tragus groups with respect to scar formation or skin pigmentation change., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Neither scapha nor tragus use for graft retrieval led to dissatisfaction or cosmetic problems in the postoperative period. Sensory changes in the skin on clinical evaluation were less common in patients in whom the scapha donor site was preferred than in cases in which the tragus was used.

N2  - Otosclerosis is a human-specific ear disease characterised by complex bone-remodelling with multifactorial aetiology. It affects the bony labyrinth capsule and consequently fixates the stapes to the oval window rim. The fixation of the ossicular chain leads to a decrease in the middle ear's acoustic impedance-fitting and amplifier function that leads to conductive hearing loss. The process is progressive and when it involves the inner ear structures, it deteriorates the sensorineural function as well. The course of the illness can be prevented or delayed if hearing reconstructive surgery is performed on time. The development of stapes surgery spans the 20th century, and despite the major surgical steps - laid down by Shea and Marquet in the 1960s - are quite conservative, fine adjustments are still being made mainly due to technical progress. Several studies confirm that stapedotomy remained the first-to-offer therapeutic option in otosclerosis. With an adequate surgical technique, significant improvement can be achieved in the air conduction threshold, the air-bone gap may be minimalized or ceased over the speech frequencies, which significantly improves the quality of life of the patients. In this quest, we reviewed the Hungarian and the international literature as well in context with otosclerosis, with special attention to the newest methods in diagnostics and treatment management.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND/AIM</ovid:b>: The outcomes of type 1 tympanoplasty in elderly patients remain controversial. Therefore, more studies are needed to clarify the prognosis of elderly patients after tympanoplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of type 1 tympanoplasty in elderly patients., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: We retrospectively analyzed data from 116 patients who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty due to chronic otitis media. Seventy-one of the 116 patients were elderly individuals aged 65 years or older (study group). Forty-five patients were younger than 65 years (control group). Due to cochlear intolerance by aging in the study group, we used dexamethasone soaked gelfoam packing in the middle ear and intraoperative dexamethasone injection. To compare the outcomes between groups, we determined the mean hearing levels by averaging the hearing thresholds. The differences in the air-bone gaps before and after tympanoplasty were compared between groups., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In the study group, 54 patients had an underlying disease (76%). Hypertension was the most common underlying disease. The postoperative air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) improved in both the study group and the control group. In the control group, postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was significantly higher than preoperative ABG. Although the postoperative ABG improved in the study group, the improvement was insignificant., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Although significant improvement of ABG was not achieved, postoperative AC and BC were improved. Intraoperative dexamethasone injection and dexamethasone soaked gelfoam packing in the middle ear was effective to prevent deterioration of BC after operation.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright&#xa9; 2020, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic type I tympanoplasty (ETT) is currently accepted as an effective, minimally traumatic procedure for repairing tympanic membrane perforation. However, ETT requires tympanomeatal flap elevation which chorda tympani nerve injury, bleeding and wound healing are the drawbacks of this technique. Thus endoscopic transtympanic myringoplasty (ETM) without elevation of the tympanomeatal flap is commonly used as an alternative technique. This study aimed to compare the efficacy of ETM versus ETT for repairing medium- to large-sized perforation of the tympanic membrane., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The study cohort comprised patients undergoing surgery for medium- to large-sized perforation of the tympanic membrane between February 2018 and February 2019. The patients were randomized into the ETM group and the ETT group. The main outcomes were the graft take rates and hearing results. Secondary outcomes were the operative time, visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores, and postoperative complications., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Forty patients who completed 6 months of follow-up were included, comprising 21 patients in the ETM group and 19 in the ETT group. The overall graft take rates for the ETM and ETT groups were 95.2% and 89.5%, respectively (P = 0.59). The graft take rates for patients in the ETM group with large-sized tympanic membrane perforation was 88.9%. There was a significantly higher rate of good hearing result in the ETM group (95.2% versus 68.4%) (P = 0.04). The ETM group had significantly shorter operative times than the ETT group (P < 0.01)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Our results demonstrated that the surgical outcome of ETM is comparable to that of ETT. However, ETM is less invasive and has a shorter operative time than ETT, and is suitable for simple perforation repair, regardless of the perforation size.

N2  - Preservation of the chorda tympani is important in middle ear surgery to prevent dysgeusia postoperatively. However, determining the exact course of the chorda tympani before surgery is not always possible, especially in cases with accompanying malformations. In this report, we presented an extremely rare case of bifurcation of the chorda tympani in a 15-year-old male patient. We performed tympanoplasty for a middle ear malformation with conductive hearing loss. During the operation, we noticed and carefully preserved the bifurcated chorda tympani. The patient did not develop dysgeusia postoperatively. Appropriate handling and understanding of the anomalous chorda tympani preserved the patient's sense of taste and hence quality of life.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: We compared the sound transmission using different types of total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORP); we then studied the performance of a new TORP that we designed inspired by the columella, the single ossicle found in birds., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Stapedial vibrations were measured on nine freshly frozen human temporal bones with laser Doppler vibrometry. We then compared the performances of eight common TORP positions or designs as well as the new silver prototype of bird-type prosthesis, designed also according to our digital holography patterns of the human tympanic membrane (TM)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The TORPs placed in lateral contact with both the TM and the malleus handle outperformed, at most frequencies, those placed only in contact with the TM. The new bird-type prosthesis performed equally well or better than all other prostheses., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: If the malleus handle can be retained when placing a TORP, the best sound transmission can be achieved by placing the TORP in contact with both the distal part of the malleus handle and the TM. The good performance of our bird-type prosthesis suggests that there is still room for future improvement of prosthesis design to further optimize hearing outcomes after surgery.

N2  - Regeneration is a biological process of cell renewal that takes place in damaged tissues or organs. It is naturally stimulated by the release of different growth factors, cytokines, surface molecules, and stem cells at the wounded sites. The tympanic membrane (TM) is an essential component of the hearing process in the auditory system, which can amplify and transmit sound vibrations through a chain of mobile ossicles. Middle ear infection, external sound pressure, insertion of sharp objects into the ear, and severe trauma are the main causes of TM perforations (TMPs), which could result in deficient hearing function. So far, otolaryngologists have employed surgical procedures (myringoplasty or tympanoplasty) to close the perforated eardrum. Because of limitations such as side effects, discomfort, and high cost to patients, there is a need for better alternatives to surgical procedures. Tissue engineering is a promising tool that can overcome the operational risk and restore, maintain, and improve the function of the TM using a range of biocompatible scaffolds, commercially available growth factors, and stem cells. Currently, multipotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a good therapeutic option for the treatment of TMPs because of their self-renewing, and autocrine and paracrine activities. As there are fewer risks of isolation in the use of MSCs for the treatment of TMPs, they are more advantageous for tissue regeneration. The delivery of either MSCs alone or a combination of MSCs with biomaterials and growth factors (GFs) at the ruptured TM sites may enhance the activation of epithelial stem cell markers and increase the migration and proliferation of keratinocytes resulting in faster closure of TMPs. This review focuses on the current strategies used to treat TMPs and the importance of MSCs in TM regeneration. Particularly, we have discussed the synergistic effect of MSCs and scaffolds or GFs or scaffolds/GFs in TM regeneration. Finally, with the advancement of tissue engineering technologies such as 3D and 4D bioprinting, MSCs can be used to design patient-specific scaffolds, which may contain physical and chemical guidance cues to improve the extent and rate of targeted tissue regeneration.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare outcomes of transcanal endoscopic tympanoplasty reconstructed using pretragal superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) fascia versus temporalis fascia., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective patient review and posttreatment questionnaire survey., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Sixty adult patients with chronic dry tympanic membrane perforation., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Patients underwent transcanal endoscopic type I tympanoplasty reconstructed using the SMAS fascia between September 2017 and May 2018; outcomes were compared with a matched cohort of patients where the temporalis fascia was used., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Tympanic membrane closure rate, audiogram threshold, duration of procedure, and donor site scar satisfaction survey., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixty patients were included in this study and were evenly divided into the SMAS and temporalis fascia groups. These cohorts were matched for age, sex, side of lesion, perforation size, and preoperative hearing level. The closure rate was 96.7% (29/30) and 93.3% (28/30) (p = 1.0), mean hearing gain was 8.3 +/- 6.4 dB versus 8.2 +/- 7.1 dB for air-conduction (p = 0.970) and 7.6 +/- 5.1 dB versus 8.2 +/- 6.8 dB for air-bone gap (p = 0.716), and mean surgical duration was 137.3 +/- 23.0 versus 132.2 +/- 27.3 minutes (p = 0.432) for the SMAS and temporalis fascia groups, respectively; there were no statistically significant differences for all the parameters listed. The posttreatment questionnaire survey revealed significantly higher acceptance of the SMAS fascia method., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This preliminary outcome report of SMAS fascia grafting in transcanal endoscopic type I tympanoplasty showed equivalent surgical outcomes and better cosmetic satisfaction compared with the temporalis fascia. The SMAS fascia is a reasonable alternative to conventional techniques for transcanal tympanoplasty.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Although bilateral same-day tympanoplasty is a faster and more comfortable procedure for patients, it is rarely performed due to its theoretical risks. The present study aims to evaluate the results of patients who underwent bilateral same-day endoscopic tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: In this study, 26 patients and 52 ears were evaluated. Postoperative anatomic success rate, pre- and postoperative hearing test results, hearing gains and postoperative complications were recorded., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Postoperative anatomic success rate was 92.3% (48/52). Audiological tests revealed the preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) as 19.1 +/- 8.8 (7-35) dB and postoperative ABG as 9.8 +/- 5.7 (5-25) dB. Postoperative ABG decreased significantly (p: <0.001) and 9.2 +/- 4.6 (2-23) dB hearing gain was obtained. We did not observe any significant complications., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Bilateral same-day endoscopic tympanoplasty is a feasible surgical procedure with good anatomic and functional outcomes, low complication rate and good postoperative patient comfort.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020.

HU did not vary over time post-surgery, with no significant correlation between HU and time to postoperative CTnscan up to 24months (p=0.219). However, a "suggestive" correlation was found between postoperative ABG and HU (p=0.004, r=-0.7). High cement density correlated with good functional outcome: HU <500 indicating functional failure and >1000 indicating ABG closure., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Immediate cement polymerization quality (high HU) was stable over time and a marker of ossiculoplasty success, correlating with good functional outcome. Particular care should be taken in preparing the cement, and solidification needs to be on dry mucosa-free ossicles.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Of the 42 patients with hearing loss in the second year, 14 had consistent and intermittent tinnitus. Among them we have 6 patients complaining consistent tinnitus and we examined the change in the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) for patients with tinnitus before and after surgery. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> Ten out of 13 cases (about 76.9%) reported that postoperative tinnitus improved. THI score in two cases showed worse. <ovid:b>Conclusions and significance:</ovid:b> Two cases showed worse THI in both mixed hearing loss cases with a small hearing improvement. The mechanism of improvement is similar to tinnitus retraining therapy including hearing aid because the increase in external sound input through hearing restoration after surgery to avoid silence.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To determine the effect of Korner's septum (KS) on graft success and hearing in patients who were treated with type 1 tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: An observational study., <ovid:b>PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY</ovid:b>: Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Health Sciences, Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital, Turkey, from July 2013 to July 2018., <ovid:b>METHODOLOGY</ovid:b>: Patients undergoing type 1 tympanoplasty were divided into 2 groups as patients with KS and without KS (WKS), according to the findings of high-resolution computed tomography of the temporal bone. Two different grafts (fascia and cartilage) in two groups (KS and WKS) were compared for graft success rate of different graft materials and pre- and postoperative hearing levels. The effect of the presence of KS on hearing was examined., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The anatomical graft success rate of type 1 tympanoplasty was 75.9% in the KS group and 88.5% in the WKS group (p = 0.026). In the presence of KS, graft success rate decreased with the use of a fascia graft (p = 0.044). In the presence of KS, the use of cartilage graft did not affect functional hearing; whereas, poor functional outcomes were obtained in ears operated using a temporalis fascia graft in the KS group than in the WKS group (p = 0.003)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: KS adversely affects graft success in type 1 tympanoplasty. Cartilage should be preferred as the graft material for patients with KS.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The conventional therapy for severe mixed hearing loss is middle ear surgery combined with a power hearing aid. However, a substantial group of patients with severe mixed hearing loss cannot be treated adequately with today's state-of-the-art (SOTA) power hearing aids, as predicted by the accompanying part I of this publication, where we compared the available maximum power output (MPO) and gain from technical specifications to requirements for optimum benefit using a common fitting rule. Here, we intended to validate the theoretical assumptions from part I experimentally in a mixed hearing loss cohort fitted with SOTA power hearing aids. Additionally, we compared the results with an implantable hearing device that circumvents the impaired middle ear, directly stimulating the cochlea, as this might be a better option., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Speech recognition outcomes obtained from patients with severe mixed hearing loss supplied acutely with a SOTA hearing aid were studied to validate the outcome predictions as described in part I. Further, the results obtained with hearing aids were compared to those in direct acoustic cochlear implant (DACI) users., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Twenty patients (37 ears with mixed hearing loss) were provided and fitted with a SOTA power hearing aid. Before and after an acclimatization period of at least 4 weeks, word recognition scores (WRS) in quiet and in noise were studied, as well as the speech reception threshold in noise (SRT). The outcomes were compared retrospectively to a second group of 45 patients (47 ears) using the DACI device. Based on the severity of the mixed hearing loss and the available gain and MPO of the SOTA hearing aid, the hearing aid and DACI users were subdivided into groups with prediction of sufficient, partially insufficient, or very insufficient hearing aid performance., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The patients with predicted adequate SOTA hearing aid performance indeed showed the best WRS in quiet and in noise when compared to patients with predicted inferior outcomes. Insufficient hearing aid performance at one or more frequencies led to a gradual decrease in hearing aid benefit, validating the criteria used here and in the accompanying paper. All DACI patients showed outcomes at the same level as the adequate hearing aid performance group, being significantly better than those of the groups with inadequate hearing aid performance. Whereas WRS in quiet and noise were sensitive to insufficient gain or output, showing significant differences between the SOTA hearing aid and DACI groups, the SRT in noise was less sensitive., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Limitations of outcomes in mixed hearing loss individuals due to insufficient hearing aid performance can be accurately predicted by applying a commonly used fitting rule and the 35-dB dynamic range rule on the hearing aid specifications. Evidently, when outcomes in patients with mixed hearing loss using the most powerful hearing aids are insufficient, bypassing the middle ear with a powerful active middle ear implant or direct acoustic implant can be a promising alternative treatment.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright The Author(s).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: Taste disturbances are often seen in patients after middle ear surgery due to the stress received by an unprotected chorda tympani. It has also been reported that loss in tactile sensitivity may accompany this issue. The current study was designed to measure electrical, chemical, and tactile sensitives of several senses involved in oral processing, smell, taste and touch, over time., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective cohort study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: For three time points, one before middle ear surgery and two after operation (about 5 and 23 days), sensitivity thresholds were obtained using electrogustometry (electrical taste), taste strips (chemical taste), Sniffin' Sticks (smell) and Von Frey Hairs (point-pressure tactile sensitivity)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The results show a decline in both chemical and electrical taste responses. Additionally, the electrical taste response showed more sensitivity to deviations and no sign of recovery unlike the chemical taste response. Mechanosensory function of the anterior tongue and olfactory function was not strongly affected by middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Taste responses, but not mechanosensory or olfaction function, are altered after middle ear surgery. Due to the effects that taste loss has on quality of life, gustometry is recommended for this group of patients., <ovid:b>LEVELS OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 4.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The objective of this prospective, single-subject, repeated measures study was to evaluate the audiological benefit and patient satisfaction with an adhesive, pressure-free bone conduction hearing system (ADHEAR; MED-EL, Innsbruck, Austria) in patients who underwent middle ear surgery with transient hearing loss due to auditory canal tamponade., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Eleven adult subjects suffering from transient conductive hearing loss were enrolled in the study and followed up to 3 weeks after middle ear surgery. Bone and air conduction thresholds were measured pre and postoperatively to evaluate eligibility for enrollment. Postoperative unaided and aided sound-field thresholds, as well as speech tests in quiet and noise were compared to confirm hearing improvement with the hearing system. To determine patient satisfaction, the SSQ12 and a system-specific quality of life questionnaire was administered to all subjects., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Speech perception for monosyllables in quiet improved by 46%, with statistical significance for the ADHEAR system compared to the unaided condition after one week. The functional hearing gain improved by 19 dB. Speech perception in noise with the device was - 6.7 dB SNR on average, with a statistically significant improvement of 2.7 dB SNR. The results of the questionnaire showed a high level of patient satisfaction and subjective hearing improvement. No serious skin reactions or other severe complications occurred., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: As long as the auditory canal is blocked due to tamponade, patients benefit from hearing rehabilitation. This adhesive hearing system is a safe and effective device to treat transient conductive hearing loss and may considerably improve treatment for patients even with short-term hearing loss.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Evaluating postural function in patients with otosclerosis by assessing otoneurological function and balance-related quality of life before and 6 weeks after surgical treatment. Correlations between and clinical features were investigated., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Thirty-three patients affected by otosclerosis underwent otoneurological examination, video Head Impulse Test (vHIT), and static posturography before and after stapedotomy. Quality of life and dizziness-related handicap were screened by means of validated questionnaires. Correlation analysis was performed in order to discover possible relations with audiological pre- and postoperative parameters., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A significant improvement in posturographic parameters was found. Correlation analysis yielded a negative correlation between preoperative bone conduction auditory threshold and both vHIT scores and postural performance improvement, evaluated by spectral analysis. Moreover, a positive correlation was also found between improvements in posturographic scores and quality-of-life questionnaires., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The study results demonstrated an improvement in postural function and self-reported measures in a cohort of patients with otosclerosis 6 weeks after stapedotomy. The inverse correlation with preoperative auditory levels may reflect lesser chance for balance restoration in cases with worse sensorineural function. Possible implications for daily activities and overall quality of life were suggested by improved self-report questionnaire results., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 4 Laryngoscope, 130:2448-2454, 2020.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To analyze health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and audiological results after stapes surgery using a Nitinol Head Prosthesis (NHP)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Study-Design Prospective longitudinal study. Patients Patients undergoing stapes surgery for otosclerosis and stapes reconstruction with a NHP between January 2018 and December 2018 (n = 48). Intervention Audiological measurements preoperatively and at 6 months follow-up as well as two questionnaires assessing HRQoL, i.e., the Stapes Plasty Outcome Test 25 (SPOT-25) and the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Main outcome measures Correlation of pure tone average (4PTA 0.5-3 kHz) with questionnaires assessing HrQOL preoperatively and at follow-up after stapes surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Patients showed a significantly reduced air-bone-gap (ABG, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz) at the follow up visit (median: 11.3 dB, IQR 5.0-14.4) compared to the preoperative measurements (median 27.5 dB, IQR 21.9-36.3). Disease-specific HRQoL improved significantly in all scales of the SPOT-25 apart from the subscore "tinnitus". Postoperatively, the subscore "hearing function" correlated well only with the ABG (r = 0.59, p = 0.001). The SPOT-25 and GBI total scores showed a moderate negative correlation (r = - 0.59, p = 0.008)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Stapes surgery leads to significant improvements of hearing and the HRQoL. However, correlations between HRQoL questionnaire scores and the audiometric outcomes were inconclusive, indicating that the use of HRQoL measures for the assessment of stapedotomy outcomes to complement objective outcomes should be encouraged.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate operative comfort and stress in patients undergoing stapedotomy for otosclerosis under local versus general anesthesia., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Consecutive otosclerosis patients managed over a 9-month period responded to 3 validated questionnaires to assess peri- and post-operative comfort: Glasgow Benefit Inventory, Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale. These results and audiometric data were compared between local and general anesthesia groups., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Twenty-one patients were included in the local anesthesia group and 7 in the general anesthesia group, after exclusion of patients with history of otosclerosis surgery. There was no significant inter-group difference on Glasgow Benefit Inventory (P=0.38) or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (P=0.86). Perceived Stress Scale scores were higher in the general anesthesia group (P=0.038). In total, 67% of patients reported no discomfort under local anesthesia, and 86% were ready to undergo the procedure under local anesthesia again. There were no significant differences in postoperative symptoms, or in air-bone gap<=10dB (local anesthesia 81%, general anesthesia 71%; P=0.156)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Local anesthesia in otosclerosis surgery did not increase stress or postoperative symptoms compared to general anesthesia.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To examine opioid prescribing patterns and consumption among patients undergoing common otologic surgeries., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective cohort study with chart review and telephone survey., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary academic medical center., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Retrospective chart review and telephone survey of those undergoing tympanoplasty, tympanomastoidectomy, stapedectomy, and cochlear implantation in 2018. The survey consisted of questions regarding the details of the number of pills taken, duration of opioid use, subjective pain control, the use of over-the-counter pain medications, opioid disposal, and their history of substance abuse., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixty-one patients were able to be contacted and agreed to participate in the study. Fifty-nine (96.7%) stated that their pain was controlled, and 10 (16.4%) did not take any opioids postoperatively despite their prescription. The mean morphine milligram equivalent (MME) prescribed was 99.9 (44.3) and MME taken was 45.2 (SD 46.3) (p < 0.001). Similarly, the mean number of pills prescribed was 17.8 (SD 8.6) and mean taken was 7.9 (SD 8.3) (p < 0.001). Comparison between males and females regarding MME and pills prescribed and taken were not statistically significantly different (p > 0.05). Analysis of the MME and pills prescribed and taken among the different surgeries (tympanoplasty, stapes surgery, tympanomastoidectomy, and cochlear implantation) revealed no statistically significant interactions (p > 0.05). Pain control was achieved for 50% of patients with 5 pills (MME = 25 mg), for 75% with 12 pills (MME = 60 mg), and for 90% with 24 pills (MME = 135 mg)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The opioid epidemic continues to be an ongoing issue in the United States, and prescription opioid abuse is a large contributor. There is increasing literature to suggest a practice of overprescribing in multiple surgical specialties. This same finding appears to be present in common otologic surgeries, where on average patients took less than half of the prescribed MME/pills, and 75% of patients had their pain controlled with 12 pills or fewer. Otolaryngologists performing otologic surgery should strongly consider adjusting their postoperative regimens to reflect these findings., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 2b.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: A significant number of adults suffer from conductive hearing loss due to chronic otitis media, otosclerosis, or other pathologies. An objective measurement of ossicular mobility is needed to avoid unnecessarily invasive middle ear surgery and to improve hearing outcomes., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Minimally invasive intraoperative laser vibrometry provides a method that is compatible with middle ear surgery, where the tympanic membrane is elevated. The ossicles were driven by a floating mass transducer and their mobility was measured using a laser Doppler vibrometer. Utilising this method, we assessed both the absolute velocities of the umbo and incus long process as well as the incus-to-umbo velocity ratio during artificial fixation of the incus alone or incus and malleus together., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The reduction of absolute velocities was 8 dB greater at the umbo and 17 dB at the incus long process for incus-malleus fixations when compared with incus fixation alone. Incus fixation alone resulted in no change to the incus-to-umbo velocity ratio where incus-malleus fixations reduced this ratio (-11 dB). The change in incus velocity was shown to be the most suitable parameter to distinguish between incus fixation and incus-malleus fixation. When the whole frequency range was analyzed, one could also differentiate these two fixations from previously published stapes fixation, where the higher frequencies were less affected., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Minimally invasive intraoperative laser vibrometry provides a promising objective analysis of ossicular mobility that would be useful intraoperatively.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The objective of this study is to describe what we consider to be the state-of-the-art procedure for the treatment of tympanic membrane perforations, and to present the results attained in our institution., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A retrospective cohort study, using data of Verona University Hospital, Italy. This medical record includes the data of 98 patients who underwent 100 transcanal endoscopic type I tympanoplasties from November 2014 to October 2017., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center University Hospital of Verona, Italy., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Were enrolled 109 patients, that underwent endoscopic type I tympanoplasty in the period considered. Out of the selected patients, 11 (10.1%) were lost to long-term follow-up, and were therefore excluded from our study. Other exclusion criteria were surgical approaches that included other procedures. Patients whose follow-up was shorter than 6 months were excluded from this study., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: The technique is based on an endoscopic placement of underlay graft of temporal fascia or tragal cartilage. We consider the data of four surgeons from Verona University ENT department., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: In the study we considered the reduction of the Air Bone Gap as functional outcome and the integrity of the reconstruction as anatomical outcome of success., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: No major intraoperative complications were observed. The closure rate was 86%. The mean surgery time was 48.6 minutes. The air bone gap was improved within 20 DB HL in 89% of patient. Only 8% of patients needed revision surgery, and none needed a third surgical evaluation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic ear surgery is by now a reality that has replaced in many cases exclusive microscopic ear surgery. Transcanal endoscopic type I tympanoplasty can be considered nowadays as an alternative technique for tympanic membrane perforations.

Twenty three patients (56.9 +/- 18.3 yr) were included., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Primary middle ear surgery or revision surgery using a HMM., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Pure-tone average, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate osseoinduction, osseointegration and presence of cholesteatoma, current quality of life assessed by Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory and change in quality of life post-intervention assessed by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Patients were reexamined after a mean follow-up period of 88.3 months (SD 21.4 mo) after obliteration of the open mastoid cavity with HMM. Compared with visit 1, patients showed a significantly reduced ABG at visit 2 (29.22 dB +/- 2.71 dB versus 12.77 dB +/- 3.46 dB). CT scan was carried out in 21 patients (91%) patients and 17 patients (74%) underwent MRI.Revision surgery was required in a total of 17 cases (74%). In four patients recurrent cholesteatoma was found at follow up., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Poor cavity obliteration, a high rate of revision surgery and difficult differentiation between recurrent cholesteatoma and granulation tissue in CT scan was observed.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Compared to canal wall up (CWU) tympanoplasty, canal wall reconstruction (CWR) allows better visualization of cholesteatoma extension. The canal wall up approach provides good functional outcomes, but with higher rates of residual cholesteatoma. The aim of this study was to compare residual cholesteatoma prevalence and location between the two approaches., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: Subjects were adult patients with residual cholesteatoma following CWU or CWR surgery between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2015. During this period, 94 patients underwent CWU and 71 CWR; 22 presented with residual cholesteatoma: 16 after CWU (R-CWU group) and 6 after CWR (R-CWR group)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There was no significant inter-group difference in residual cholesteatoma prevalence: 17% after CWU, 8.4% after CWR. Locations comprised: 13 (81%) in the attic, 9 (56%) in the tympanic cavity and 4 (25%) in the mastoid in the R-CWU group, and 6 (100%) in the attic in the R-CWR group. There were significantly fewer tympanic cavity locations after CWR compared to CWU (P=0.046)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Residual cholesteatoma prevalence did not significantly differ between the CWU and CWR approaches. The most frequent location was the attic; significantly more locations were in the tympanic cavity with the CWU approach. These findings are important for surgeons and neuro-radiologists during follow-up.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: There are no studies in the literature, comparing the functional and anatomical successes of the use of fascial and perichondrial grafts in endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasties., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To compare the anatomical and functional outcomes of grafting with the fascia of the temporalis muscle and with the perichondrium of the tragal cartilage in patients undergoing primary transcanal type 1 tympanoplasty with endoscopy., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We enrolled a total of 151 patients (80 females and 71 males with a mean age of 26.0 +/- 9.3 years in the age range between 18-57) with MERI scores ranging from 1 to 3 and who underwent a transcanal endoscopic type 1 tympanoplasty without tympanomeatal flap elevation. The patients were assigned to two groups according to the type of the graft used. The patients were assigned to either the tragal cartilage perichondrium group (Group A) or the fascia of the temporal muscle (Group B). The groups were compared according to the pre- and postoperative air-bone gaps and to the status of the tympanic membrane., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of the age, gender, localization, MERI scores, the duration of the operation, and the size of the perforation (all p values> 0.05). The pre-operative air-bone gap values of Group A and B did not show a statistically significant difference (p = 0.073). The postoperative improvement in the air-bone gap value did not demonstrate a significant difference between Group A and B (p = 0.202). The graft retention rates were 94.9 and 97.2% in Group A and in Group B respectively. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of the graft retention success rates (p = 0.743)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Perichondrium and fascia were suitable for use in endoscopic tympanoplasties.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This meta-analysis compares the efficacy and safety of endoscopic and microscopic approaches to tympanoplasty and stapes surgery, two common middle ear procedures., <ovid:b>DATA SOURCES</ovid:b>: A comprehensive electronic search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was conducted for studies published from the year 1960 through June 2018. Article selection and screening proceeded according to the strategies outlined in the standard Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis statement., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Studies were assessed for quality using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Jadad scale depending on the presence of randomization. Bias was analyzed using funnel plots. For each outcome measure, a forest plot was generated and a pooled relative risk or risk difference was calculated to assess significance., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Twenty-one studies met the inclusion criteria, 16 tympanoplasty (1,323 ears) and 5 stapes surgery (283 ears). The nonrandomized studies scored moderately well but the randomized studies were of low quality with respect to the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Jadad Scale, respectively. With respect to tympanoplasty, statistical analysis demonstrated that the endoscopic approach had significantly lower canalplasty rates, better cosmetic outcomes, and shorter operative times. Furthermore, endoscopic compared to microscopic methods were similar in terms of audiological outcome, graft success rate, and complication rate. Among stapes surgeries, the endoscopic approach demonstrated a significantly decreased incidence of postoperative pain and chorda tympani injury but was similar to the microscopic approach with respect to audiological outcome, postoperative dizziness, and operative time., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Though the merits of endoscopic techniques are becoming more well known, there are still concerns regarding their efficacy and safety. An analysis of the current literature suggests that audiological, functional, and safety outcomes are similar, if not superior, for the endoscopic approach to both tympanoplasty and stapes surgery compared to the microscopic approach. With respect to tympanoplasty, patients undergoing the endoscopic approach had lower canalplasty rates, better cosmetic outcomes, and shorter operative times. Among stapes surgeries, patients in the endoscopic group had a lower incidence of postoperative pain and injury to the chorda tympani. This meta-analysis of the current evidence supports the use of endoscopic techniques for tympanoplasty and stapes surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW</ovid:b>: The incidence of blast injuries has increased, and the ear is the highest risk organ. Ear injury induced by blast exposure is important in both military and civilian conditions. The permanent hearing loss caused by blast exposure is associated with a decline in the quality of life. In this review, I describe recent therapeutic strategies for each of the ear pathologies caused by blast exposure., <ovid:b>RECENT FINDINGS</ovid:b>: For tympanic membrane perforation after blast exposure, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been used as a less invasive treatment to repair the tympanic membrane. The closure rates of tympanic membrane perforations treated with bFGF were reported to be comparable to those following conventional tympanoplasty.For sensorineural hearing loss after blast exposure, treatment with neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) or neurotrophin-3, antioxidants, and Atoh1 induction have recently been applied, and some of them were considered for clinical application., <ovid:b>SUMMARY</ovid:b>: Recent advances of therapeutics for blast-induced hearing loss, based on their pathologies, have been outlined. There are several promising therapeutic approaches for both middle and inner ear disorders after blast exposure; however, further research is needed to establish new treatments for blast-induced hearing dysfunction.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> To analyze the clinical characteristics and appropriate surgical procedures, and discuss the classification of congenital middle ear malformation. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Methods:</ovid:b> All cases were from the Center of Otorhinolaryngology, the Sixth Medical Center of Department of PLA General Hospital. All of these cases, including 26 male patients (ears) , 10 female patients (11 ears) , aged from 7 to 57 years old, had normal external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, conductive hearing loss, type A tympanogram and negative Gelle's test. Tympanoplasty was performed in all cases. The deformity was classified to three types,i.e., Type I (stapes foot plate mobility): Ia, ossicular chain deformity with normal stapes suprastructure; Ib, ossicular chain deformity with abnormal stapes suprastructure; Type II (stapes foot plate fixation): II a,normal ossicular chain, II b, ossicular chain malformation; and Type III: vestibular window osseous atresia or undeveloped, or with round window atresia. The malformation of type II and III may be accompanied with abnormal facial nerve. In addition, the papers on middle ear malformation published from 1982 to 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical data of 451 ears malformation were summarized. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> According to the revisional classification criteria in 37 ear samples from our hospital, 20 ears were type I. 6 type Ia cases were used PORP (partial ossicular replacement prosthesis) to reconstruct the ossicular chain; 14 type Ib cases were used TORP (total ossicular replacement prosthesis) to reconstruct the ossicular chain. For the 5 ears of type II, 2 of which were type II a and 3 were type II b. 4 ear samples of type II were implanted with Piston ossicular prosthesis, 1 was implanted with TORP in which the ossificated foot plate was removed with periosteum preserved. 12 ear samples were type III, with vestibular window osseous atresia, facial nerve malformation, and stapes suprastructure malformation. The pistons ossicular prosthesis were implanted in vestibular window in 3 ears with facial nerve covering vestibular window partially. The surgery had to be given up in 5 ears, and TORP was implanted in 4 ears at the opening with preserved periosteum at the beginning of the tympanic scala because of facial nerve covering vestibular window totally. 30 ears with complete follow-up data had no sensorineural hearing loss and the average air-bone conduction decreased 23.3+/-10.7 dB (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i><0.05). There were 234 ears of type I in 451 ears of congenital middle ear malformation reported in the literature. 113 of which were type Ia, the basic surgery was ossicular chain shaking and artificial or autogenous PORP implantation. Type Ib was 121 ears, with autogenous or artificial TORP and PORP. Type II was125 ears, including type IIa 22 ears, IIb 60 ears, and no subclassification for 43 ears. The surgery of type II was the same as otosclerosis. The vestibular window atresia of type III was 92 ears, the surgery of 17 ears had to be abandoned, the other ears underwent vestibular window, promontory or semicircular canal opening to reconstruct hearing with Piston, autogenous or artificial TORP. <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> Referring to the classification of congenital middle ear malformation combining with appropriate surgical materials and methods, otologists can better understand and choose appropriate surgical method to the middle ear malformation.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Stapes surgery is a common method of treatment of otosclerosis, and its effectiveness is reported based on audiometric hearing thresholds. Audiometric tests do not gauge the impact of tinnitus severity and auditory function on quality of life (QOL) after stapes surgery., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To measure self-assessed QOL in otosclerosis patients after stapedotomy in terms of three major factors: change in audiometric hearing threshold, subjective hearing benefit, and tinnitus severity., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: This prospective clinical study included 191 patients who underwent stapedotomy between April and October 2017 due to otosclerosis. All patients were tested by pure tone audiometry and filled in a questionnaire before surgery and 6 months afterwards. Subjective hearing was assessed with the Abbreviated Profile for Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB); tinnitus severity was established using the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), and the QOL was measured by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Statistical analysis showed that the average GBI total score (mean = 33.7; SD = 23.7) was statistically significantly higher than zero (t = 19.7; p < 0.001). Based on a regression model, all the three variables studied - audiometric hearing thresholds change, APHAB change, and TFI change - had a significant effect on QOL after stapedotomy. Interestingly, the highest beta value (b = 0.040; p < 0.001) was for TFI change, implying that TFI change had the greatest effect on QOL., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Although the improvement of QOL after stapes surgery undoubtedly depended on improvement in both audiometric and self-reported hearing, the reduction of tinnitus severity had the greatest impact on increase in QOL.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 S.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate the impact of allograft and xenograft in pediatric tympanoplasty on patient outcomes., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective cohort study of 50 pediatric patients undergoing tympanoplasty at a single tertiary pediatric hospital system that received either autograft, allograft, or xenograft. Patients were evaluated for persistent perforation, recurrent perforation, revision surgery, and postoperative infection. Hearing outcomes, operative charges, and operative time were also evaluated. Statistical analyses included chi-square and Fisher exact tests for categorical data and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests for continuous data., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Half of the cohort received autografts, whereas 38% received xenografts and 14% received allografts. Although there was not a significant difference in charges associated with these procedures, xenografts had the shortest mean operative time (mean: 39 vs 68 minutes in autografts, <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = .05). Overall, the rate of persistent perforation was 10%, recurrent perforation was 20%, revision surgery was 16%, and postoperative infection was 18%. There were no differences in the rates of these outcomes by graft type. Furthermore, there was no observed difference in hearing outcomes among autograft and xenograft recipients, but allograft recipients had significantly improved hearing postoperatively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Similar rates of complications were observed among autografts, xenografts, and allografts, providing preliminary evidence that they are safe to use in pediatric tympanoplasty.

N2  - <ovid:b>Background:</ovid:b> Tympanoplasty is regularly performed in various ages but data about the procedure in elderly is insufficient. <ovid:b>Objectives:</ovid:b> To compare the success rates and hearing outcomes of fascia and perichondrium grafts used for tympanoplasty in patients >65 years and to evaluate the prognostic factors affecting the success of tympanoplasty. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Methods:</ovid:b> Reviewing records of 49 elderly patients underwent tympanoplasty, two groups were constituted: perichondrium (25 patients) and fascia (24 patients) groups. Ages, genders, perforation sides, type and location of perforation, graft success rates, functional success rates and air-bone gap (ABG) gains were compared. <ovid:br/><ovid:b>Results:</ovid:b> Overall graft success rate was 85.7%. After a mean follow-up of 23.3 +/- 8.32 months, overall mean ABG gain was 11.33 +/- 8.42 dB. Overall median postoperative ABG value (9 dB) was significantly lower compared to the median preoperative value (24 dB) (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < .001). Graft success rate was higher in perichondrium group (96%) compared to fascia group (75%) (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = .04). Functional success rate did not significantly differ between perichondrium (68%) and fascia groups (62.5%) (<ovid:i>p</ovid:i> = .68). <ovid:b>Conclusion and significance:</ovid:b> Tympanoplasty is an effective procedure with a graft success rate of 85.7% in elderly. Both fascia and perichondrium are suitable materials; however, perichondrium had higher success rate.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty functional outcomes were compared to those of other methods for reconstructing Austin-Kartush type B ossicular defects., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Forty-two patients underwent Austin-Kartush type B ossicular defect reconstruction using: manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty (13 patients), an autologous incus (19 patients) or a titanium ossicular replacement prosthesis (10 patients). For manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty reconstruction, the malleus head was removed, the manubrium was relocated posteriorly and the incus short process was placed on the mobile footplate. The manubrium was placed on the incus body groove and bone cement was applied to stabilise the manubrium-incus junction. Pre- and post-operative hearing thresholds were assessed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The air-bone gap decreased from 25.9 +/- 6.0 dB to 12.3 +/- 5.0 dB (p < 0.05) in the manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty group. The hearing gain was 13.6 +/- 5.2 dB for manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty, 3.4 +/- 14.2 dB with the autologous incus, and 3.3 +/- 11.07 dB with the titanium ossicular replacement prosthesis. Hearing improvement was greater for manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty compared to the other reconstruction methods (p < 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Manubrio-incudo-stapedioplasty resulted in satisfactory hearing outcomes in patients with Austin-Kartush type B ossicular defects. This technique can be considered a stable, inexpensive and effective method to reconstruct Austin-Kartush type B ossicular defects.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To determine whether stapedotomy was effective in reducing tinnitus severity. In addition, the relationship between reduction in tinnitus and improvement in hearing after stapedotomy was analyzed., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective clinical study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: A group of 168 otosclerosis patients diagnosed with chronic tinnitus., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Stapedotomy., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: The Tinnitus Functional Index questionnaire (TFI) was used to assess tinnitus severity before surgery, and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. Pure-tone audiometry was conducted before surgery and 6 months postoperatively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The TFI Total score before the operation was M = 34.5 (standard deviation [SD] = 1.6) points, and decreased 3 months after stapedotomy to M = 17.5 (SD = 1.7), a statistically significant change (T = -8.200; p < 0.001). A weak correlation was found between the pre- and postoperative difference of TFI Total score and air-conduction thresholds (r = 0.21; p = 0.013) as well as between the TFI Total score and the size of the air-bone gap (r = 0.21; p = 0.013). Preoperatively, 86 patients tinnitus was a not or small problem, and for 82 it was moderate to very big. After stapedotomy, 93 (55%) of patients experienced a significant reduction in tinnitus severity. Of the whole group, 62 patients (37%) reported complete disappearance of their tinnitus. No change in tinnitus severity was reported by 63 patients (38%), and an increase was observed by 12 patients (7%)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Stapedotomy not only improves hearing but also reduces tinnitus severity. The current results extend knowledge of postoperative results in terms of tinnitus severity, and might benefit patients undergoing tinnitus counseling. It might also be useful to otolaryngologists when making decisions regarding qualification criteria.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To demonstrate that neurotologists enjoy performing stapedectomies., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS</ovid:b>: A group of survey recipients consisting of 174 neurotologists who perform stapedectomy, a nonoverlapping control group of 145 head/neck oncologists who perform parotidectomy, and a second nonoverlapping control group of 365 pediatric otolaryngologists who perform tonsillectomy., <ovid:b>OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Responses to surveys distributed by electronic mail to the 3 nonoverlapping recipient groups during nonoverlapping 4-week periods., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: During the 4-week survey periods, 84 of 174 neurotologists (48%) responded, while 33 of 145 oncologists (23%) and 87 of 365 pediatric otolaryngologists (24%) responded. Most neurotologists performed stapedectomy (80/84; 95% of survey responders), while 33 of 33 (100% of survey responders) oncologists performed parotidectomy and 87 of 87 (100% of survey responders) pediatric otolaryngologists performed tonsillectomy. Seventy-six of the 80 neurotologists who performed stapedectomies (95%) enjoyed performing it, slightly more than the 30 of the 33 oncologists who performed parotidectomies (91%) and appreciably more than the 67 of 87 pediatric otolaryngologists who performed tonsillectomies (77%). Twenty-three neurotologists (30%) would sacrifice vacation time to perform additional stapedectomies, slightly more than 8 oncologists (27%) for additional parotidectomies and more than the 7 pediatric otolaryngologists (10%) for additional tonsillectomies. Ten (13%) of the neurotologists, 3 (9%) of the oncologists, and 1 (2%) of the pediatric otolaryngologists would sacrifice 5 or more vacation days to perform more of the procedures., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Our data suggest that neurotologists enjoy performing stapedectomy.

Inclusion criteria included age>=7years, entire perforation margin visualized through a transcanal view, and the ability to lie supine for up to 45min. Exclusion criteria included a conductive hearing loss larger than expected, and presence of active infection., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: In-office modified myringoplasty technique under local anesthesia without sedation., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Complete perforation closure rate and audiometric outcomes., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 250 patients underwent the procedure, of whom 13 had bilateral sequential procedures (total 263 ears). Of those, 197 were primary and 66 revision. Average age was 46.3years. Perforation sizes were categorized as small (32), moderate (109), large (78), and subtotal (44). Complete perforation closure was evident in 219 of the 250 cases (88%). Preoperative mean air pure tone average (PTA) was 56.7dB and mean bone PTA was 27.5dB (pre-operative ABG 29.2dB). AC-PTA significantly improved to 35.0dB (p<0.0001), and ABG to 9.6dB (p<0.0001). Only subtotal perforations showed a statistically significant negative relationship with outcome (p=0.04)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The modified palisade cartilage-perichondrium graft myringoplasty under local anesthetic is a highly successful procedure well tolerated by adult and pediatric patients with variable perforation sizes. This may have significant potential patient benefits, as well as cost savings to the health care system.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: We aim to investigate hearing sensitivity and wideband tympanometry results in bone cement ossiculoplasty cases in present study., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A prospective study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Ossiculoplasty patients were grouped according to the anatomical location of bone cement application by surgery note. Ossiculoplasty and tympanoplasty patients were retrospectively invited to the clinic and evaluated. 30 bone cement ossiculoplasty cases as well as 30 Type I tympanoplasty cases (intact ossicular chain) and 30 healthy controls were included in the study and Wideband Tympanometry was performed. Tympanometric peak pressure, equivalent middle ear volume, static admittance, tympanogram width, resonance frequency, average wideband tympanometry and absorbance measurements were analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A statistically significant improvement was observed in the hearing levels of all ossiculoplasty and type I tympanoplasty patients (p<0.05). Bone cement ossiculoplasty groups demonstrated the remarkable differences than the type I tympanoplasty and control group in Wideband Tympanometry test parameters. In some parameters, malleus-stapes and manubriostapedioplasty groups demonstrated similarities to Type I tympanoplasty and control groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Bone cement is an effective application for ossiculoplasty. Wideband tympanometry is a promising method for the evaluation of the middle ear dynamics.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Thiel conservation is mainly based on a watery solution of salts. We have shown that bone conduction (BC) evokes motion in normal middle ears of Thiel embalmed specimens that is comparable to the motion for other cadaveric models., <ovid:b>AIMS/OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: We evaluated whether promontory and round window (RW) motion identifies differences in BC transmission for different middle ear conditions., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We investigated the conditions of mobile ossicle chain, cement-fixed stapes and stapedectomy in seven ears. A retroauricular bone anchored hearing system provided BC stimulation. The motions of the promontory and the RW were measured using single point laser Doppler vibrometer (LDV, HLV1000, Polytec)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The averaged differences between the conditions were small for RW motion and for promontory motion. However, for RW motion we found differences of more than one standard deviation at some frequencies. These differences in RW motion were more apparent when we limited the analysis to three selected specimens., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE</ovid:b>: Extracochlear measurement of the RW motion with LDV allowed differentiation between BC for different middle ear conditions. These changes could be detected best in a small frequency range in selected specimens. Promontory motion could not be used to differentiate between different conditions of the middle ear., <ovid:b>ABBREVIATIONS</ovid:b>: LDV: laser Doppler vibrometry; Prom: cochlear promontory; RW: round window; ST: stapes; TM: tympanic membrane; VProm: velocity of the promontory; VRW: velocity of the round window.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess ossiculoplasty results in children and screen for predictive factors of efficacy., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Seventy five children undergoing ossiculoplasty between 2001 and 2014 in a pediatric ENT department were included. The following data were collected and analyzed: demographic data, surgical indication, history of tympanoplasty, contralateral ear status (healthy, affected), preoperative hearing thresholds, surgical technique, intraoperative findings, and ossicular chain status at eardrum opening. Audiological results were reported according to American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery guidelines., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Forty eight patients were included in the total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (TORP) group. Mean age at surgery was 9.9years. Mean follow up was 2.7years. Mean air-bone gap (ABG) closure to within 20dB was achieved in 40% of cases at medium term (12 to 18 months after surgery). Air conduction (AC) threshold <=30dB was achieved in 68% of cases. AC threshold improved by 14.6dB and 8.7dB at medium and long-term follow-up, respectively. A significant correlation was found between success rate and absence of history of tympanoplasty. The success rate was higher for primary than for revision procedures. Twenty seven children were included in the partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (PORP) group. Mean age was 9.5years, and mean follow-up 2.6years. Mean air-bone gap (ABG) closure to within 20dB was achieved in 75% of cases at medium term. AC threshold <=30dB was achieved in 75% of cases AC threshold improved by 9.3dB and 5dB at medium and long-term follow-up, respectively. No predictive factors for success were found in the PORP group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The present study suggested that total ossiculoplasty leads to better results when performed in first-line. It also confirmed that functional outcome is better in partial than total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The timing of tympanoplasty in the pediatric age group is an ongoing debate. The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the success of grafts in type 1 tympanoplasty in pediatric patients, and to evaluate the prognostic factors that may affect its success., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective study of 42 pediatric patients who were younger than 18 years and underwent a primary type 1 tympanoplasty using tragal cartilage perichondrium and temporalis fascia from January 2013 to December 2018, were evaluated. A total of 42 medical records of children aged between 8 and 18 years (20 female, 22 male) were reviewed. Age, gender, co-morbidities, perforation size and location, type (central, marginal), pre- and post-operative hearing levels, mean air-bone gap (ABG), graft material (fascia, perichondrium), length of follow up and surgical outcomes were collected., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The overall graft success rate was 83.3% (out of 35 patients). The graft success rate was significantly higher 95.2% (20/21) for the perichondrium group compared with 71.4% (15/21) for the temporal fascia group(p=0.023). The functional success rate (postoperative air-bone gap<20dB) obtained in the perichondrium group was 90.4% (19/21) and 85.7% (18/21) in the fascia group, respectively. After a mean follow-up of 27.5+/-11.55 months, the mean hearing improvement was 11.26+/-7.53 dBHL for overall the group. Presence of contralateral otitis media with effusion (OME) was found a risk for reperforation and bilateral perforations were negatively affected graft success rate (p<0.01). Graft success did not affected by age, gender and type and location of perforation (p>0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Both temporalis fascia and tragal cartilage perichondrium are suitable graft materials for pediatric tympanoplasty with 83.3% of graft success rate. Tragal cartilage perichondrium may be the first choice of graft material due to its high success rates. There were no significant differences between the fascia and perichondrium groups in terms of functional results. Reperforation is more likely to occur in bilateral perforations and contralateral OME, and should be treated with perichondrium or cartilage graft.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - Tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure aiming to reconstruct the tympanic membrane and hearing. The aim of this study was to compare anatomic and audiological results of cartilage graft with temporal fascia graft in type 1 tympanoplasty patients. We conducted a descriptive, retrospective study of medical records of patients who underwent tympanoplasty between January 2010 and December 2015 at the Department of Otolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery of Farhat Hached University Hospital. In total, we obtained 46 patients. Twenty-three patients who underwent type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty using cartilage graft were compared with 23 patients in whom temporal muscle fascia was used. In follow-up, residual perforation occurred in 1 of 23 patients (4.3%) undergoing cartilage tympanoplasty and in 2 of 23 patients undergoing fascia tympanoplasty (8.7%), which was found to be statistically non significant (P > 0.05). In both cartilage and fascia groups, when they were compared in terms of gain, no significant difference was found between groups (P = 0.271), air bone gap gain was found to be 12.9 +/-9.9 decibels in cartilage group, whereas it was 10 +/- 6.6 decibels in fascia group. Operation success is defined by successful anatomical and functional outcome. Among all patients, 35 (76%) were reported to have operation success. It was established that type of operation had no significant influence on success (P = 0.73). Currently, there is an increasing interest in using cartilage grafts in primary tympanoplasty. Especially, in patients with severe middle ear pathology, cartilage graft should be used routinely without risk on influencing audiological results.

N2  - Implantable auditory devices (IADs) are a viable hearing restoration option for patients with hearing loss. Conditions such as chronic otitis externa, congenital aural atresia, and chronic otitis media can be treated with a variety of implants. Progressive disease are also amenable to restoration with IADs, providing stabilized hearing. When considering the best rehabilitative options, the patient's preference, ease of surgery, ease of device use, quality of life, and the traditional alternatives (such as ossiculoplasty, hearing aids, and cochlear implants) need to be considered. Patients with conductive, mixed, and sensorineural losses, mild to severe in nature, can be candidates for IADs.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To show the efficiency of using transmastoid atticotomy (TMA) endoscopy on the outcome of ossiculoplasty in patients with cholesteatoma. TMA is often performed as part of the surgical management of patients with middle ear cholesteatoma extending to the epitympanum. TMA can also be used as an access for endoscopic view to confirm the right alignment and stability of the ossicular prosthesis because the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane will obscure the visualization of the prosthesis., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective study was done at a tertiary referral institute, including 133 ears with cholesteatoma that underwent canal wall-up tympanomastoidectomy (CWU) with ossicular reconstruction using titanium prosthesis between August 2013 and August 2015. Post packing of the ear canal and position, stability, and axis of the prosthesis were checked using endoscope positioned in the attic through TMA. A postoperative pure-tone average air-bone gap (ABG) of 20 dB or less was considered as a successful hearing result. Results are compared with historical control groups., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of the 133 ears, 88 patients underwent reconstruction with partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP), whereas the rest (45 patients) had total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP). A postoperative ABG <= 20 dB was obtained in 77.4% of all the patients (79.5% for PORP; 73.3% for TORP)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic assessment of the ossicular prosthesis via the attic, after repositioning of the tympanomeatal flap and packing the ear canal, decreases the risk of immediate ossiculoplasty failure and improves the functional outcome after ossicular chain reconstruction in cholesteatoma surgery., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 4 Laryngoscope, 129:2754-2759, 2019.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the quality of perceived sound after stapedotomy over a 1-year follow-up period focussing on incidence of dysacusis, particularly distorted sound perception (DSP). DSP was assessed by (i) determination of the frequencies and hearing level that such perceptions are elicited by pure tones (pure-tone-evoked distorted sound perception, PTE-DSP), a novel psychoacoustic measurement introduced in this paper, and (ii) assessment of patient-reported occurrence of DSP using the Amsterdam Post Operative Sound Evaluation (APOSE) questionnaire (APOSE-DSP)., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective study., <ovid:b>STUDY SAMPLE</ovid:b>: Patients (n = 23) with otosclerosis undergoing stapedotomy., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: An air-bone gap of <20 dB was achieved in 100% of the patients. Three weeks postoperatively, 48% of the patients reported measured PTE-DSP and 39% of the patients experienced APOSE-DSP. The PTE-DSP significantly decreased during the 1-year follow-up period (p = 0.03). Postoperatively, APOSE-DSP was associated with a smaller benefit (improvement in air conduction; p = 0.03), yet, a lower bone conduction pure-tone average was associated with PTE-DSP (p = 0.006)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: DSP after stapedotomy is associated with a smaller benefit 3 months after stapedotomy. DSP commonly occur after stapedotomy, but decrease over time. This is important information to be included in patient counselling before stapedotomy.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Tinnitus is a common disease in public. It is not only associated with neuronal, muscular, vascular pathologies, but also with related psychological parameters. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between tinnitus, anxiety and depression in patients undergoing tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Patients with tinnitus and operated for chronic otitis media were included in our study. Before and after the operation, tinnitus handicap inventory, beck anxiety and depression scales were filled and pre- and postoperative values were compared. In addition, our patients were divided into two groups as tinnitus improve and did not improve and differences between them were investigated., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 148 patients were included in our study. Of 148 patients, 60 were male and 88 were female. There was no significant difference between the patients with and without tinnitus when the dermografic features, hearing levels and physical examination findings were compared. After the operation, the patients who did not improve tinnitus had higher levels of depression and depression than others (<0.001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: As a result of our study, anxiety and depression scales of the patients whose tinnitus did not improve were found to be higher than the patients whose tinnitus improved.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To develop and validate a bleeding score that could be applied in endoscopic ear surgery (EEarS)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A prospective validation study was performed. A new bleeding score, called "Modena Bleeding Score" (MBS), was created by the authors. It provides five grades for rating the surgical field during EEarS procedures (from grade 1-no bleeding to grade 5-bleeding that prevents every surgical procedure except those dedicated to bleeding control). A preliminary "face validity" was performed by 18 ENT specialists to assess possible misunderstandings in interpreting the scale. Then, 15 videos of endoscopic ear surgery procedures, each divided into three parts (t0, t1, and t2), were subsequently evaluated by 15 specialists, using MBS. The videos were randomly selected and assigned. Intra-rater reliability and inter-rater reliability were calculated. The clinical validity of the instrument was calculated using a referent standard (i.e., four ENT experts whose ratings were compared to those obtained by the former sample)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The face validity showed a good consensus about the clarity and comprehension of the scale; both intra and inter-rater reliability demonstrated good performance (intra-rater reliability ranged from 0.741 to 0.991 and inter-rater reliability was 0.790); clinical validity also showed positive values, ranging from 0.75 to 0.93., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: MBS has proved to be an effective method to rate surgical field during EEarS, with good-to-excellent performances. Its use would possibly help comparisons of groups in clinical trials or comparisons between studies.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate and compare functional outcomes of tympanoplasty procedures with temporalis fascia and four different types of cartilage grafts in chronic otitis media (COM) cases with normal preoperative hearing levels., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Records of patients who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty for non-complicated COM in a tertiary medical center between January 2010 and January 2017 were reviewed. Patients with central or marginal and dry perforations of the tympanic membrane, normal middle ear mucosa, intact ossicular chain and patients with a preoperative pure tone average (PTA) level of 25 dB or less and a word recognition score (WRS) of 88% or greater were included in the study. Graft success rates, preoperative and postoperative functional outcomes, and anatomical results were analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: One hundred and forty-four patients who met the inclusion criteria were evaluated in the study. PTA and Air-bone gap (ABG) levels decreased significantly both in TF and CG groups after the surgery (p = 0.001). Similarly, WRS scores increased significantly in both groups (p = 0.001). There was not a significant difference in terms of PTA increase, WRS increase, and ABG closure levels between cartilage and TF groups. Increase in PTA, closure in ABG, and increase in WRS levels were compared among TF, WsCCG, MCG, PCG, and CPIG groups. The increase in PTA levels was also found to be significantly superior in the TF group (p = 0,023). However, the multivariate analysis showed no significant difference for increase in WRS, closure in ABG and increase in PTA levels according to graft type (p = 0.285; p = 0.461; p = 0.106, respectively) and gender (p = 0.487; p = 0.811; p = 0.756, respectively)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In COM cases with normal preoperative hearing, both TF and cartilage lead to superb functional and anatomical outcomes. There was not a significant difference in terms of PTA increase, WRS increase and ABG closure levels between cartilage and TF groups. The graft success rate of cartilage was found to be superior to TF, but there was not a statistically significant difference. Different types of cartilage grafts can be used in cases with normal preoperative hearing without the concern of hearing impairment.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Patients with otosclerosis more often complain about postoperative taste disturbance than patients with chronic otitis media, which seems paradoxical. We aim to investigate if and potentially why this seems to be the case, since the chorda tympani nerve (CTN) is thought to be severely traumatized less frequently during surgery in the former than in the latter., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective cohort study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Hospital of Vastmanland, Vasteras, Sweden., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Sixty-five adults undergoing primary middle ear surgery were included. Thirty-seven were operated on for chronic suppurative otitis media with or without cholesteatoma (CSOM) and 28 for otosclerosis., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Middle ear surgery due to otosclerosis or CSOM. Subjective and objective taste measurements and quality of life (QoL) questionnaire., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Taste was assessed using electrogustometry (EGM) and the filter paper disc (FPD) method before and up to 1 year after surgery. Questionnaires on taste disturbance, including a visual analogue scale (VAS), and QoL were completed before and up to 1 year after surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Subjective taste disturbance anytime during the 1-year follow-up were reported by 62 and 46%, respectively. The difference in EGM 1 week after surgery compared with preoperative EGM was significantly greater among CSOM patients than otosclerosis. One year postoperatively, the difference is non-significant., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Surgery for CSOM causes greater initial and more long-lasting taste disturbances as compared with surgery for otosclerosis. One-year postoperative taste normalizes for both CSOM and otosclerosis patients according to VAS and EGM measurements. No real change in QoL was seen 1-year postoperatively., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: Level 2 evidence is prospective observational research with an experimental design.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: To investigate the simultaneous application of cartilage tympanoplasty combined with eustachian tube (ET) balloon dilatation in the treatment of adhesive otitis media (AdOM)., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Patients with AdOM were randomly divided into four groups: control group (conservative treatment), ET balloon dilatation (ETBD) group, cartilage tympanoplasty (CT) group, and cartilage tympanoplasty combined with ET balloon dilatation (ETBD+CT) group. Patients were followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment, receiving otoendoscopy and pure-tone audiometry, and were evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), visual analogue scale (VAS) for the symptom of ear stuffiness, Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test (COMOT-15), and eustachian tube scores (ETS)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There was no improvement in tympanic membrane (TM) morphology and mean pure-tone air-bone gap (ABG) after treatment in the control and ETBD groups. The postoperative TM morphology was improved in the CT group and ETBD+CT group, although retraction pockets reoccurred in two cases of CT group. Reduced ABG and improvements in ETS, THI, VAS, and COMOT-15 were all achieved in these two groups, but the difference was not statistically significant., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Cartilage tympanoplasty combined with ET balloon dilatation could be used as an appropriate surgical technique for AdOM, which could relieve the symptoms of tinnitus and ear stuffiness, and improve postoperative TM morphology, hearing level, ET functions, and quality of life, with low incidence of complications., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 2 Laryngoscope, 129:1462-1467, 2019.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2018 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of congenital cholesteatoma (CC) in Japan, via a nationwide survey using staging and classification criteria for middle ear cholesteatoma, as proposed by the Japan Otological Society (JOS)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A nationwide survey regarding middle ear cholesteatoma treated in 2015 was performed. There were 1787 registrations from 74 facilities, among which, CC accounted for 12.9% (231 cases) of all middle ear cholesteatoma cases. The extent of the disease was classified according to the classification and staging of cholesteatoma proposed by JOS in 2015., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The age of the patients ranged from 1 to 55 years (mean, 8.2 years; median, 6 years; 149 ears of males; 82 ears of females). Among these cases, 105 (45.5%) were classified as stage I, 121 (52.4%) as stage II, and 5 (2.1%) as stage III, with no cases in stage IV. In the sub classification of stage I, 35 (33%), 43 (41%) and 27 (26%) ears were classified as stages I-a, I-b and I-c, respectively. Stage I-b (cholesteatoma confined to the posterior half of the tympanic cavity) was more frequent than stage I-a (the anterior half of tympanic cavity). Pre-operative hearing level of air-conduction was 20.5dB for stage I-a, 34.5dB for stage I-b, 30.5dB for stage I-c, 38.6dB for stage II, and 59.0dB for stage III. The rate of missing stapes superstructure increased as the disease progressed. In the same way, the mastoid development lowered as the stage of the disease progressed. There were significant differences in the age at operation, pre-operative hearing level, status of stapes, and major ossiculoplasty, between stage l-a and l-b., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The current condition of CC in Japan was been evaluated; in particular, it was observed that the cases limited to the posterior part of tympanic cavity were not rare. The JOS stage classification based on the progression of the disease seemed simple and efficient.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2018. Published by Elsevier B.V.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: To assess the somatosensory dysfunction of the auricle and periotic skin in patients undergoing otitis media surgery., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Symptoms of periotic somatosensory function after surgery were investigated in 100 patients (42 males, 58 females, mean age 41.39 years) who underwent otitis media surgery. Questionnaires on periotic somatosensory disturbance were answered after surgery at least over 1 year postoperatively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of 100 tympanoplasties, all patients were completed within a postauricular approach. The highest incidence rates of periotic sensory disturbance were found in the postauricular region (75%), followed by the auricular region (20.83%); lower rates were found in the preauricular region (2.08%) and the earlobe (2.08%). Periotic somatosensory dysfunction occurred in 48 patients (48%). The most prevalent somatosensory abnormality was tactile hypoaesthesia/numbness, evident in 28% of the patients; more remarkable, inferior postauricular region. Periotic pain was reported by 21% of the cases, mostly located in the upper auricle. Compared to the recovery time of tactile hypoaesthesia (7.36 months), patients' periotic somatosensory pain improved significantly within 4.07 months, which has obvious statistical significance (P < 0.01)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The likelihood of periotic cutaneous sensory dysfunction should be emphasized to patients undergoing otitis media surgery via postauricular approaches, which occurred in nearly half of patients; the majority recovered within 1 year. Furthermore, the postauricular region is the most vulnerable location to sensory disturbance, followed by the auricular region. Functionally, periotic somatosensory pain was more easily resilient, relative to tactile hypoaesthesia/numbness., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 4 Laryngoscope, 129:454-458, 2019.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2018 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: Postoperative tinnitus and taste disturbances after myringoplasty are more common than previously reported., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: This study was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the Swedish National Quality Registry for Myringoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The analysis was performed on extracted data from all counties in Sweden collected from database A from 2002 to 2012 and database B from 2013 to 2016. Tinnitus and taste disturbance complications 1 year after myringoplasty were analyzed in relation to gender, age, procedure, and success rate. In database A, physicians reported tinnitus and taste disturbances. In database B, patients reported the complications., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A major difference was found when the complications were reported by physicians compared to when the complications were reported by patients. In database A, tinnitus was reported in 1.2% of the patients and taste disturbances in 0.5%. In database B, the frequencies were 12.3% and 11.2%, respectively. Tinnitus and taste disturbances were more frequent after conventional myringoplasty compared to those after fat grafting and were more frequent after primary compared to those after revision surgery when reported by physicians. Patients, however, reported the same frequency of tinnitus after fat graft myringoplasty compared to that after conventional myringoplasty (12.0% vs. 12.6%) and fewer taste disturbances after revision surgery. In follow-up assessments, complications persisted after surgery over a long time period., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Tinnitus and taste disturbances are more common after myringoplasty when patients report their symptoms than when physicians report the symptoms., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 2b Laryngoscope, 129:209-215, 2019.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2018 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To investigate the success rates and hearing outcomes of temporalis fascia and tragal cartilage grafts used for type-1 tympanoplasty in the elderly (365 years) METHODS: The medical records of 73 elderly patients who underwent type-1 tympanoplasty at our center between January 2010 and June 2017 were retrospectively reviewed for age, gender, perforation side, presence of contralateral perforation, type and location of perforation, graft material types, preoperative and postoperative hearing levels, and length of follow-up., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The graft success rate was 83.5% (61 patients) for the entire group, 76.2% (32 patients) for the fascia group, and 93.5% (29 patients) for the cartilage group. The success rate for the cartilage group was significantly higher than that for the fascia group (P=0.048). The mean hearing gain was 12.5+/-7.6 and 8.9+/-6.1dB in the fascia and cartilage groups, respectively, and postoperative ABG was 10 dB or better in 29 (69.0%) and 19 (61.3%) patients, respectively. The mean hearing gain was significantly higher in the fascia group than in the cartilage group (P=0.028), whereas the mean ABG was significantly higher in the cartilage group than in the fascia group (P=0.009). The functional success rates were similar in both groups (P=0.490)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Tympanoplasty is a safe and effective procedure in elderly patients with a 83.5% of graft success rate. Tragal cartilage may be the first choice of graft material due to its high success rates. The functional outcomes did not show significant differences between the fascia and cartilage groups.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: In the course of restoration of the middle ear, routine histological examinations are initiated in many cases, although a middle ear cholesteatoma can be clinically diagnosed in a normal case., <ovid:b>AIM OF THE STUDY</ovid:b>: To determine the correlation between the surgeons' diagnosis and that of the pathologist and comparison with literature data. To check the rate of unexpected diagnoses. Analysis of the costs and survey of German ENT clinics with regard to handling of the histological examination in suspected cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Retrospective evaluation of cholesteatoma cases of the ENT Department of the University Medical Center of Mainz from 2010-2015. Germany-wide postal survey of ENT clinics., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In all, 449 operations for the rehabilitation of a middle ear cholesteatoma, of which there were 312 (69.5%) first diagnoses and 137 (30.5%) recurrences. A histological examination was conducted in 78.6%. For first diagnoses, the sensitivity of the clinical assessment was 97.9%, specificity 10%, positive predictive value 96.3%, and negative predictive value 16.7%. Recurrences showed values of 100%, 40%, 97.1% and 100%. Unexpected malignant findings did not occur. This routine histological examination was performed by 58.6% of German ENT hospitals. A total of 80% of those questioned this to be useful. A histological examination cost an average of 14.06., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Intraoperatively, there is a high degree of accuracy in diagnosing cholesteatoma. The cost factor of the histological examination is low and should not be the basis for the decision. The ear microscopy and the experience of the ear surgeon should be decisive for the decision for histological examination.

N2  - The article presents the most frequent type of chronic middle ear inflammation in children and the middle ear surgery. Middle ear reconstructions in childhood represent a complex issue. Their aim is to remove the pathological process in the middle ear and subsequently to restore the transfer function of the middle ear. Autologous and biocompatible materials can be used for reconstruction. Hearing gain is essential, especially in childhood, for the patient's further life. Good hearing in childhood is key for proper development of speech and learning. The quality of life, mental and language skills and children's development are thus positively influenced by the operation. Even in childhood, these operations can achieve good results, both anatomical and functional.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: A lesser known after effect of harvesting temporalis fascia is the post-surgical craniofacial pain. The aim of the study was to evaluate this pain after tympanomastoid surgeries and the effectiveness of silastic sheet interpositioning to prevent this pain., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: This pilot study that spanned one year, included patients who underwent tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy involving the harvesting of temporalis fascia. At the end of surgery, the wound was closed after silastic sheet was secured over the donor site in cases and without silastic sheet in controls. In the post-operative period, patients scored their temporal pain, tenderness and pain during opening of mouth and mastication on a visual analogue scale (VAS) on day 7, 15, 30 and 90., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores of the silastic group were lower than the control group on day 7 and 15 after surgery and the difference was statistically significant. In the control group, temporal pain and tenderness were 74% and 81% respectively on day 7. VAS scores of both groups decreased over time and were negligible after 3 months. There were no significant postoperative complications in either group and no reaction or rejection of silastic sheet in the cases., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Post-surgical craniofacial pain secondary to the harvesting of temporalis fascia is observed in a majority of the patients. This novel technique involving silastic sheet interposition can decimate early post-operative temporal pain, tenderness and masticatory pain.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This study aimed to investigate the effect of canal wall up with bony obliteration tympanoplasty (CWU-BOT) on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma by using the chronic otitis media questionnaire 12 (COMQ-12)., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: This study is a retrospective analysis of the COMQ-12 of 26 patients who completed the COMQ-12 before and after a CWU-BOT with eradication of cholesteatoma followed by obliteration of the mastoid and paratympanic space with bone chips and bone pate and reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and ossicular chain., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All patients were operated upon in our institute between 2014 and 2017. The median score of the 12 questions was preoperatively and postoperatively calculated, and then compared. A large effect was observed in the total score and the questions about running ear, discharge, and visits to the general practitioner. A medium positive size effect was observed in the questions about hearing in noisy surroundings, discomfort, dizziness, tinnitus, medication use, and the mental aspect of the patient. In the questions about the hearing at home and quality of life and impact on work, we noted a small positive size effect. In 50% of patients, the HRQOL became normal; the remaining 50% improved to a level very close to normal., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Canal wall up with bony obliteration tympanoplasty (CWU-BOT) showed a clear decrease in the severity of the symptoms, life and work impact, and health care after surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Chronic suppurative otitis media is a global middle ear disease with quality of life as economic implications, which are worse felt in low and middle income (LAMI) countries; thus the need for myringoplasty. This study aimed to explore audiological function in a group of adults following myringoplasty in South Africa, with an exploration of the possible influence of factors such as HIV/AIDS and type of surgical technique on hearing outcomes., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Within a retrospective chart review research design, 41 participant files for a six-year period from two academic hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa, were reviewed. Data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Participant files comprised of 16 males and 25 females between 18-63 years. Findings revealed that clinically, overall hearing improved post-operatively, as indicated by improved tympanometry findings, pure tone air-conduction and speech reception thresholds. Descriptively, the predictors of improved hearing outcomes post-operatively appeared to be HIV negative status and butterfly cartilage inlay surgery as a surgical technique adopted. Although clinically, hearing outcomes improved post-operatively at all air-conduction frequencies tested; these clinical improvements were only statistically significant at specific frequencies., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Current findings provide useful initial evidence on the benefits of myringoplasty from the South African context; particularly because of the HIV/AIDS prevalence and its potential influence on middle ear disease and its management. Prospective efficacy studies with bigger sample sizes are recommended, with early identification strategies for middle ear disease to reduce the need for myringoplasty seriously considered bearing in mind the resource constraints.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Katijah Khoza-Shangase et al.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To compare quality-of-life (QoL) measurements with audiological results after stapes surgery with two different prostheses., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This is a retrospective longitudinal study. All patients required stapes surgery for otosclerosis and ossicular chain reconstruction with either a titanium band prothesis (TBP) or receiving a nitinol head prosthesis (NHP). Intervention was between January 2011 and March 2017 patients received stapes-surgery with either TBP (n = 95) or NHP (n = 50). Audiological measurements at three different time points (preoperatively, early follow up < 3 months, late follow-up > 3 months) were compared and two different QoL-inventories, the Glasgow-Benefit-Inventory (GBI) and the Stapes-Plasty-Outcome-Test-25 (SPOT-25) were investigated postoperatively. The main outcome measures were Pure tone average (PTA) at 0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz at early and late follow up after stapes surgery were compared and correlated with the subjective benefit on the QoL inventories. The perforation method and the type of surgery were analyzed as potentially influencing factors., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All patients showed a significantly reduced air bone gap (ABG 0.5, 1, 2, 3) at the two follow-up visits (visit 2: mean: 13.6 dB, SD 7.7; visit 3: mean: 12.7 dB SD 8.1) compared to preoperative measurements (mean: 28.9 dB, SD 9.9) and subjectively benefitted from stapes surgery (mean GBI score: 21.55; SD 20.60, mean SPOT-25 score: 28.03; SD 18.53). The outcome of the two questionnaires correlated with each other. Neither the hearing-outcome nor the subjective benefit was significantly influenced by the prosthesis, the perforation method or the type of anesthesia., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Both prostheses were safe and led to comparable hearing results as well as to subjective benefits in the Health-related-Quality-of-Life (HrQoL). A combination of the two questionnaires is recommendable for postoperative quality control.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the long-term safety and performance of four different vibroplasty couplers (round window, oval window, CliP and Bell coupler) in combination with an active middle ear implant., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This was a multicentre, prospective, long-term study including 5 German hospitals. Thirty adult subjects suffering from conductive or mixed hearing loss were initially enrolled for the study, 24 of these were included in the final analysis with up to 36 months of postsurgical follow-up data. Bone conduction and air conduction were measured pre- and postoperatively to evalu ate safety. Postoperative aided sound field thresholds and Freiburger monosyllable word recognition scores were compared to unaided pre-implantation results to confirm performance. Additional speech tests compared postoperative unaided with aided results. To determine patient satisfaction, an established quality-of-life questionnaire developed for conventional hearing aid usage was administered to all subjects., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Mean postoperative bone conduction thresholds remained stable throughout the whole study period. Mean functional gain for all couplers investigated was 38.5 +/- 11.4 dB HL (12 months) and 38.8 +/- 12.5 dB HL (36 months). Mean word recognition scores at 65 dB SPL increased from 2.9% in the unaided by 64.2% to 67.1% in the aided situation. The mean postoperative speech reception in quiet (or 50% understanding of words in sentences) shows a speech intelligibility improvement at 36 months of 17.8 +/- 12.4 dB SPL over the unaided condition. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improved by 5.9 +/- 7.2 dB SNR over the unaided condition. High subjective device satisfaction was reflected by the International Inventory for Hearing Aids scored very positively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: A significant improvement was seen with all couplers, and audiological performance did not significantly differ between 12 and 36 months after surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 S.

N2  - The objective of the present study was the analysis of the medical assistance seeking behaviour of the patients presenting with suppurative chronic otitis media (CSOM) and their treatment in Moscow during the period from 2009 till 2016. The incidence of suppurative chronic otitis media in the city of Moscow in 2016 was estimated to be 0.14 per 1000 population, its prevalence 1.23 per 1000 population. The materials of the statistical reports of Moscow ENT clinics give evidence of the considerable growth in the number of the admitted patients suffering from ear diseases including suppurative chronic otitis media (mean 5.5). The surgical activity of the ENT clinics with respect to CSOM amounted to 46%. The overall increase in the number of surgical interventions is attributable to a rise in the frequency of reconstructive operations. These data give evidence of excellent continuity in the work of outpatient facilities and ENT clinics, intensification of their activities, and a change of the people's attitude toward the care for their health. Suppurative chronic otitis media is the commonest pathology encountered in the specialized ENT hospitals where it accounts for 59.8% of the total number of ENT diseases. The frequency of the surgical interventions performed for the treatment of CSOM amounts to 98.9%. The enhanced attention given to the patients with this pathology resulted in the two-fold increase of the specialized medical assistance provided to the patients presenting with suppurative chronic otitis media. The most frequently practiced form of the surgical treatment employed for the management of CSOM is tympanoplasty (in 72% of the patients on the average). The 'closed' variants of sanitizing operations are performed in 59.8% of the patients presenting with chronic suppurative otitis media and concomitant cholesteatoma whereas the 'open' interventions are used to treat 45.1% of the patients in need of tympano- and mastoidoplasty. On the whole, the priority surgical treatment of the patients with chronic suppurative otitis media in specialized medical facilities is reconstructive operations intended to simultaneously reach the beneficial sanative and functional effects without deterioration of the quality of life of the patients suffering from chronic suppurative otitis media.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: When measuring the treatment effect in tinnitus with multi-item outcome instruments, it is crucial for both clinical and research purposes to take into consideration clinical importance of the outcome scores. The aim of the present study is to determine minimal important change (MIC) in tinnitus which is clinically meaningful to patients with otosclerosis., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The study population was 95 patients with otosclerosis, suffering from tinnitus. They completed the Tinnitus Functional Index before stapedotomy and 3 months after the surgery. The minimal important change was estimated with the Clinical Global Impression Scale as the external criterion (anchor). The mean change method and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) method were used to determine minimal important change in tinnitus sensation., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The improvement in tinnitus after stapedotomy was reported by 69.4% of the patients with otosclerosis. Minimal important change in tinnitus was estimated as reduction of 8.8 points in the Tinnitus Functional Index., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The anchor-based approach using an external criterion (anchor) allows to determine change in tinnitus sensation which is meaningful to patients after stapedotomy. The value of 8.8 points in Tinnitus Functional Index could be used as benchmark of stapedotomy effectiveness in otosclerosis patients suffering from tinnitus. Hearing difficulties comorbid with tinnitus could affect the perception of tinnitus change.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To compare the anatomical and functional outcomes of two different grafts which are used for the reconstruction of subtotal or total tympanic membrane perforations: the wheel-shaped composite cartilage graft (WsCCG) and temporalis fascia (TF)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Ninety patients (94 ears) who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty for non-complicated chronic otitis media between March 2014 and June 2016 in a tertiary referral center were included in a randomized, controlled, prospective clinical trial. Tympanic membranes were reconstructed with the WsCCG or TF., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Outcomes of 91 surgeries performed on 87 adults (> 18 years of age) were evaluated in the study. Forty-three patients (44 ears) were included in the WsCCG group; 44 patients (47 ears) were included in the TF group. The mean post-operative follow-up was 14.9 months for the WsCCG group and 15.1 months for the TF group. There was no statistically significant difference in post-operative pure tone average (PTA) (p = 0.19), air-bone gap (ABG) (p = 0.64), PTA gain (p = 0.82) and ABG closure (p = 0.89) values between two groups. Graft success rates at 6 months after surgery were 82.9% (39/47) and 97.7% (43/44) for TF and WsCCG, respectively. At the first year, success rates were 85.1% (40/47) for TF and 97.7% (43/44) for WsCCG. A statistically significant difference was observed in graft success rates between two groups (p = 0.039)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Both TF and WsCCG lead to satisfactory functional results, but the WsCCG clearly leads to superior anatomical outcomes with a graft success rate of 97.7%. The WsCCG is a suitable graft for subtotal or total tympanic membrane perforations and has the advantages of being a one-piece, flexible, composite, and physically resistant graft.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The objective of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of conventional two-dimensional (2D) endoscope with a novel computer-based three-dimensional (3D) imaging system for otologic surgical procedures., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A conventional 2D monocular endoscope with a novel computer-based 3D imaging system was applied to 18 otologic surgical procedures, including chronic otitis media (COM), cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, external canal osteoma and cochlear implant. Operation duration and complications of COM and attic cholesteatoma were recorded to compare 2D and 3D endoscopic ear surgery. Questionnaires were completed by 35 observers participating in the procedures and were used to evaluate clinical and potential side effects., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The surgical procedures were performed smoothly for all patients. No patient required switching to conventional 2D endoscopic surgery. No significant differences were apparent in operation duration using the 3D imaging system for chronic otitis media and attic cholesteatoma compared with conventional 2D endoscopic ear surgery. Thirty-five observers completed the questionnaires. Most of them agreed that this 3D imaging system enabled them to perceive stereoscopic vision (94%), provide superior depth perception (85%). Furthermore, 97.1% reported no visual fatigue or discomfort when observing the 3D images., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Our study demonstrated that the computer-based 3D imaging system enables the application of 3D vision technology to otologic surgery. The system has no obvious side effects, such as visual fatigue or time delay. It not only facilitates performing the related surgical procedures but also helps in teaching and learning endoscopic ear surgeries.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate the efficacy of stapes surgery in patients presenting with a preoperative mixed hearing loss (bone conduction thresholds >=40 dB; 40 < air conduction thresholds (AC) < 85 dB)., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A total of 30 patients (32 ears) with mixed hearing loss who underwent primary stapedotomy were evaluated. Audiometric parameters were assessed before and after surgery. Contralateral thresholds were also reported. The need for a hearing aid (HA) after surgery and its impact on quality of life were also measured., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: AC and word recognition at 40, 55 and 70 dB were significantly improved after stapes surgery. Only 16.6% of the patients needed an HA after surgery and reported being satisfied with the aid., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Stapes surgery improved auditory function in patients with mixed hearing loss, allowing most patients to delay the need for an HA without worsening their quality of life.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2018 S.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: An analysis of the scope of practice of recent Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery (OHNS) graduates working as general otolaryngologists has not been previously performed. As Canadian OHNS residency programs implement competency-based training strategies, this data may be used to align residency curricula with the clinical and surgical practice of recent graduates., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Ontario billing data were used to identify the most common diagnostic and procedure codes used by general otolaryngologists issued a billing number between 2006 and 2012. The codes were categorized by OHNS subspecialty. Practitioners with a narrow range of procedure codes or a high rate of complex procedure codes, were deemed subspecialists and therefore excluded., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There were 108 recent graduates in a general practice identified. The most common diagnostic codes assigned to consultation billings were categorized as 'otology' (42%), 'general otolaryngology' (35%), 'rhinology' (17%) and 'head and neck' (4%). The most common procedure codes were categorized as 'general otolaryngology' (45%), 'otology' (23%), 'head and neck' (13%) and 'rhinology' (9%). The top 5 procedures were nasolaryngoscopy, ear microdebridement, myringotomy with insertion of ventilation tube, tonsillectomy, and turbinate reduction. Although otology encompassed a large proportion of procedures billed, tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy were surprisingly uncommon., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This is the first study to analyze the nature of the clinical and surgical cases managed by recent OHNS graduates. The findings demonstrated a prominent representation of 'otology', 'general' and 'rhinology' based consultation diagnoses and procedures. The data derived from the study needs to be considered as residency curricula are modified to satisfy competency-based requirements.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Although overlay grafting for complicated tympanic perforations offers a high success rate, potential complications may outweigh its advantages. This study aimed to assess endoscopic overlay tympanoplasty (EOT), compared with microscopic overlay tympanoplasty (MOT), to optimize outcomes while minimizing complications associated with large tympanic perforations., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Nonmasked, randomized., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary care university hospital., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Altogether, 70 patients with large tympanic perforations were randomized to undergo overlay tympanoplasty between June 2014 and July 2016. Primary outcome was the visual analog scale (VAS) of pain. Secondary outcomes were anatomic closure, hearing results, middle ear findings, and postoperative complications., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Overall, 34 EOT patients and 30 MOT patients completed the follow-up. VAS scores at 4, 24, and 48 hours in EOT and MOT groups were, respectively, 3 and 8, 1.7 and 6.0, and 0.6 and 4.1. Postoperative pain was less in the EOT group ( P < .001), and canalplasty was not required ( P = .003). Graft "take" rates for EOT and MOT were 97.1% and 93.3%, respectively ( P = .60). Postoperative air-bone gap was lower with EOT (5.0 vs 10.3 dB) ( P = .01). Various middle ear structures were more visible after EOT than after MOT ( P < .001). Ear protrusion ( P = .008) and postauricular numbness ( P < .001) occurred after 50 MOTs., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: EOT for repairing large tympanic perforations provides more favorable anatomical and audiometric outcomes. It also offers superior visibility of middle ear structures without lifting the annulus, with fewer complications and less invasiveness than MOT.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: A tube dysfunction is a common medical issue and can promote chronic otitis media. With the implementation of the Balloon dilation a treatment of the chronic tube dysfunction was set. In the present study significance of this method was assessed, especially questioning the success in practical terms of tympanic membrane retraction., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: In a retrospective study, in a period of assessment from 2011 until 2016, the data of 81 patients, who underwent Balloon dilation of the Eustachian tube due to chronic tube dysfunction with regard to a preoperative presence of tympanic membrane retraction were evaluated. The success of the Balloon dilation was judged due to the capability of a postoperative SVT- Test and the patients' self-assessment. With an average postoperative period of four months, the data of 13 patients were analyzed based on presence of pre- and postoperative tympanic membrane retraction., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The treatment occurred at all cases without complications. In patients with chronic tube dysfunction the method revealed an improvement of 46 %, while 31 % of the patients with tympanic membrane retraction showed an improvement of the middle ear ventilation. Subjectively perceived 54 % of the patients marked an improvement of their clinical symptoms., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In spite of a self-assessed improvement in 54 % only 31 % of the patients with chronic membrane retraction showed an objectively measurable success. To evaluate the question if combination with other middle ear surgeries shows better results, further studies, including more patients and data, are required.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare levels and causes of postoperative pain after cholesteatoma removal by transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES) versus microscopic ear surgery (MES)., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective case series., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: One-hundred-and-sixty-one patients who had undergone middle ear surgery between February 2013 and April 2016., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Comparison of postoperative pain between TEES and MES groups and among TEES and MES subgroups divided by range of bone removal., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Two parameters were used to assess postoperative pain: a pain numeric rating scale (NRS) and number of times a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) was taken from postoperative days (PODs) 1 to 7. We also examined the primary factor behind postoperative pain looking at: 1) the surgical incision; 2) bone removal; and 3) number of involved middle ear regions., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: One-hundred-and-six patients underwent TEES and 55 underwent MES. The mean pain NRS for the 7-day postoperative period was significantly lower for the TEES group (1.1) than the MES group (2.8) (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The number of times a NSAID was taken was lower for the TEES group (1.3 pills/wk) than the MES group (5.5 pills/wk) (p < 0.001, Mann-Whitney U test). The mean pain NRS of the TEES and MES subgroups also suggests that extent of bone removal or number of involved middle regions was less important in causing postoperative pain than presence or absence of the retroauricular incision., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: TEES is associated with lower postoperative pain and lower use of NSAIDs compared with MES patients.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To report a novel management strategy for mixed hearing loss in advanced otosclerosis., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A 50-year-old male was referred to St Thomas' Hearing Implant Centre with otosclerosis; he was no longer able to wear conventional hearing aids because of recurrent otitis externa. The patient underwent short process incus vibroplasty (using the Med-El Vibrant Soundbridge device), followed at a suitable interval (six weeks) by stapes surgery. The main outcome measures were: pure tone audiometry, functional gain and monosyllabic word recognition scores., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Post-operative pure tone audiometry showed a reduction of the mean air-bone gap from 55 dB HL to 20 dB HL. The residual mixed hearing loss was rehabilitated with the Vibrant Soundbridge, with an average device gain of 32 dB. The monosyllabic word recognition scores in quiet at 65 dB improved from 37 to 100 per cent when using the Vibrant Soundbridge at six months after switch-on of the device., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Stapedotomy in conjunction with incus short process vibroplasty (i.e. inner-ear vibroplasty) is a safe and promising procedure for managing advanced otosclerosis with mixed hearing loss in selected patients.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: A total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) with a silicone coated ball and socket joint (BSJ) is able to compensate pressure changes and therefore provide better sound transmission compared with rigid prostheses., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Dislocation and extrusion are known complications after TORP reconstruction, leading to revisions and recurrent hearing loss. Poor aeration of the middle ear, scar tension, and static pressure variations in conjunction with rigid prosthesis design causes high tension at the implant coupling points., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A novel TORP prototype with a silicone coated BSJ has been developed. Experimental measurements were performed on nine fresh cadaveric human temporal bones of which five were used for a comparison between rigid TORP and flexible TORP tympanoplasty. The middle ear transfer function was measured at ambient pressure and at 2.5 kPa, both positive and negative pressure, applied in the ear canal., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The flexible TORP design yields a better transmission of sound after implantation and at negative pressure inside the tympanic cavity, compared with rigid TORP. In average, it provides an equivalent sound transfer like the intact middle ear. At positive pressure, the flexible TORP performs slightly worse. Both performed worse than the intact middle ear, which is related to an uplifting of the prostheses., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The findings may be considered preliminary as this experimental study was limited to just one of the many different possible situations of tympanoplasty and it involved a small sample size. Nevertheless, the results with the flexible TORP were promising and could encourage further investigations on such prostheses.

N2  - Objective To evaluate the recent developments in optical coherence tomography (OCT) for tympanic membrane (TM) and middle ear (ME) imaging and to identify what further development is required for the technology to be integrated into common clinical use. Data Sources PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science. Review Methods A comprehensive literature search was performed for English language articles published from January 1966 to January 2018 with the keywords "tympanic membrane or middle ear,""optical coherence tomography," and "imaging." Conclusion Conventional imaging techniques cannot adequately resolve the microscale features of TM and ME, sometimes necessitating diagnostic exploratory surgery in challenging otologic pathology. As a high-resolution noninvasive imaging technique, OCT offers promise as a diagnostic aid for otologic conditions, such as otitis media, cholesteatoma, and conductive hearing loss. Using OCT vibrometry to image the nanoscale vibrations of the TM and ME as they conduct acoustic waves may detect the location of ossicular chain dysfunction and differentiate between stapes fixation and incus-stapes discontinuity. The capacity of OCT to image depth and thickness at high resolution allows 3-dimensional volumetric reconstruction of the ME and has potential use for reconstructive tympanoplasty planning and the follow-up of ossicular prostheses. Implications for Practice To achieve common clinical use beyond these initial discoveries, future in vivo imaging devices must feature low-cost probe or endoscopic designs and faster imaging speeds and demonstrate superior diagnostic utility to computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. While such technology has been available for OCT, its translation requires focused development through a close collaboration between engineers and clinicians.

N2  - Despite the widespread use of the anaesthetics propofol (PROP) and isoflurane (ISO), data about their toxicogenomic potential and interference in epigenetic events are unknown. This study evaluated the expression and methylation profile of two important DNA-repair genes (XRCC1 and hOGG1) in 40 patients undergoing elective and minimally invasive surgery (tympanoplasty and septoplasty) under ISO or PROP anaesthesia. The endpoints were examined at three sampling times: before anaesthesia (T0), 2 h after the beginning of anaesthesia (T2) and 24 h after the beginning of surgery (T24). Both gene expressions were assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), whereas methylation specific-PCR (MS-PCR) evaluated the DNA methylation patterns. Increased expression of XRCC1 was observed at T2 only in the PROP group. On the other hand, hOGG1 and XRCC1 expressions were decreased at T24 in both groups. There were no statistical significant differences between the two anaesthetics at the respective sampling times. The methylation status of XRCC1 (methylated at T0) and hOGG1 (unmethylated at T0) remained unchanged in the three sampling times. In conclusion, this study showed modulations of hOGG1 and XRCC1 expression especially 1 day after elective surgery in patients undergoing PROP and ISO anaesthesia. However, the data indicated that methylation was not the mechanism by which the genes were regulated. More studies are warranted to further investigate the possible epigenetic mechanisms involved after exposure to anaesthetics.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Literature review shows a limited number of studies investigating chronic pain following ear surgeries. The effect of mastoidectomy on chronic postsurgical pain, however, has never been investigated. The present study investigates not only the incidence and severity of chronic pain following ear surgeries with and without mastoidectomy, but also predisposing diseases for pain., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The study was performed in a total of 150 patients who underwent tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy through a retroauricular incision in a single tertiary health care center. During the routine postoperative 3rd-month examination, the patients were questioned for the presence and severity of chronic pain, as well as the diseases that might predispose the pain., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The difference between the visual analog scale scores of the groups was not statistically significant. Comparison of pain character revealed that neuropathic pain is more prevalent in both the groups. Evaluating the relationship between concomitant diseases and chronic pain, it was observed that migraine, cervical pathology, and acute postsurgical pain were closely associated with chronic pain., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: It was demonstrated that mastoidectomy does not pose an additional risk for chronic postsurgical pain. However, patients with migraine, cervical pathology, and acute postsurgical pain are at risk for chronic postsurgical pain.

The patients responded taste and salivation surveys preoperatively, and 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: We analyzed results of questionnaires including disturbance rates, severity and character to evaluate taste and salivation functions., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Taste disturbance rate was significantly improved in all groups during follow-up (p < 0.05). The incidence of taste disturbance did not differ significantly between the three groups at each follow-up (p > 0.05). The taste disturbance score improved gradually in the cut and intact groups (p < 0.001), but not in the manipulated group (p = 0.067). Among the patients with taste disturbance, hypoguesia was most common symptom. Incidence of salivation disturbance did not differ between the three groups (p = 0.298). However, this symptom improved significantly only in the intact group (p < 0.001). The taste and salivation disturbance rate was not different between patients with and without chronic otitis media at 3 and 6 months, and both groups showed significant improvement., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Prevalence of taste and salivation disturbance was similar between three groups until 6 months. However, taste disturbance did not improve in the manipulated group and salivation disturbance improved only in the intact group.

N2  - <ovid:b>IMPORTANCE</ovid:b>: The ideal surgical treatment of cholesteatoma has been subject to discussion for years because both traditional surgical techniques (canal wall down [CWD] and canal wall up [CWU] tympanoplasty) have their own advantages and disadvantages. A more recently propagated surgical approach, to combine the CWD or CWU tympanoplasty technique with obliteration of the mastoid and epitympanum, is showing promising results., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To systematically review the literature on recurrent and residual cholesteatoma rates after single-stage CWU and CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration., <ovid:b>EVIDENCE REVIEW</ovid:b>: A systematic search of literature was performed to identify relevant publications in multiple electronic databases. The initial search was conducted in December 2016 and was updated in July 2017. Each study was reviewed by 2 independent reviewers on predetermined eligibility criteria. The methodological quality was determined using the methodological index for nonrandomized studies (MINORS) scale, and the relevance to the current topic was determined using a 4-criterion checklist., <ovid:b>FINDINGS</ovid:b>: The searches identified a total of 336 potentially relevant publications; 190 articles were excluded based on title and abstract. The full-text articles of the remaining 146 citations were assessed for eligibility, resulting in 22 articles. After assessing these remaining articles for methodological quality and relevance to the current topic, another 8 studies were excluded, and a total of 13 studies (1534 patients) were included. Of the 1534 patients who underwent CWD or CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, the rate of recurrent disease was 4.6%, and the rate of residual disease was 5.4%. In CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, these rates were 0.28% and 4.2%, respectively and in CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, 5.9% and 5.8%, respectively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE</ovid:b>: We show the recurrent and residual disease rates after either CWU or CWD tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration to be qualitatively similar to, if not better than, previously reported rates of for nonobliterative techniques. In this study, the lowest recurrent and residual rates were reported when combining the CWU tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration, on average 0.28 and 4.2%, respectively.

N2  - Objectives Surgical repair of a tympanic membrane perforation is a common otologic procedure. However, achieving a successful closure can be challenging, especially if the anterior margin of the tympanic membrane is involved. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature on evidence published in closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforations. Data Sources The following data sources were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1997 to August, 3 2017), MEDLINE (February 1948 to August 3, 2017), and Embase (1975 to August 3, 2017). Data Extraction Two authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines were followed. For the purpose of this study, the inclusion criteria were as follows; (1) studies reporting surgical technique for closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforations, (2) primary cases only, (3) articles published in the English language, (4) minimum 6-month follow-up, and (5) recorded pre- and postoperative audiometry. The exclusion criteria were non-English language articles, revision surgery, and no audiometric outcomes. Results On initial search, a total of 181 articles were identified (PubMed, n = 136; Cochrane, n = 28; Embase, n = 17). Based on the criteria, 136 articles were excluded. Full text of 45 articles was reviewed, and a further 24 articles were excluded. A total of 21 articles fulfilled the criteria for study inclusion. Conclusions All published evidence is level 4. High-quality controlled studies are required to determine the most effective method for closure of anterior tympanic membrane perforation.

N2  - Otosclerosis surgery is performed through a transcanal approach and requires long, thin instruments with submillimetric precision and precise amplitude of motion. The functional outcomes and complications of otosclerosis surgery depend on the experience of the surgeon. Thus, any technological assistance that can enhance the surgeon's dexterity and rapidly reduce the learning curve could yield an even safer surgical procedure. One of the options is to use robotic assistance to achieve this goal. An overview of different robots designed for otosclerosis surgery is presented focusing on the RobOtol system that we have designed as a multitask platform for ear surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: To describe the in vivo vascularization of middle ear by an endoscopic point of view, particularly focusing on the medial wall of tympanic cavity and incudostapedial region (ISR)., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Case series with surgical videos review and anatomical description., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: 48 videos from exclusive endoscopic middle ear surgery performed at the University Hospital of Modena from November 2015 to July 2017 were reviewed. Data about anatomy of vessels, and blood flow direction (BFD) were collected in an appropriate database for further analyses., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 48 cases were included in the present study. In 18/48 patients (37,5%), a clearly identifiable inferior tympanic artery (ITA) was present, running just anteriorly to the round window (RW), with a superior BFD (65% of cases) from the hypotympanic region toward the epitympanum. Some promontorial variants were described in 67% of cases and the most common finding was a mucosal vascular network with a multidirectional BFD. On the ISR, an incudostapedial artery (ISA) was detected in 65% of cases with BFD going from the long process of the incus (LPI) toward the pyramidal eminence in the majority of cases., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The vascular anatomy and BFD of the medial wall of the tympanic cavity can be easily studied in transcanal endoscopy. ITA (with a superior BFD in most cases) and ISA (with a main BFD from the incus to the stapes) are the most constant identifiable vessels.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The application of mastoid pressure dressings following mastoid and middle ear surgery is widely practised to reduce the risk of haematoma and seroma. There are a number of minor morbidities associated with use of the dressings, as well as a financial cost associated with an overnight stay in hospital or a return appointment for removal of the dressings. The benefit of having these dressings in situ overnight is questionable., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective review of 133 patients who had their mastoid dressing removed 2 h after their procedure was undertaken at our Hospital. The patient records were scanned for procedure-related morbidities, and perioperative data were analysed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: No haematomas or seromas occurred in any of the 133 patients studied. Minor morbidities associated with prolonged use of mastoid pressure dressings were avoided., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Removal of mastoid pressure dressings 2 h following ear surgery is safe and effective. Furthermore, a mastoid dressing should not be a factor in the decision as to whether to treat a patient as a day case or overnight admission.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2018 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This study aimed to compare the outcome of endoscopic tympanoplasty with sterile acellular dermal allograft (ADA) and conventional endaural microscopic tympanoplasty with tragal perichondrium., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This was a retrospective comparative study of 53 patients (25 males and 28 females) with tympanic membrane perforation who underwent type I tympanoplasty in the department of otorhinolaryngology at a tertiary medical center from March 2011 to April 2017. The subjects were classified into two groups; transcanal endoscopic tympanoplasty with ADA (TET, n=26), conventional endaural microscopic tympanoplasty with autologous tragal perichondrium (EMT, n=27). Demographic data, perforation size of tympanic membrane at preoperative state, pure tone audiometric results preoperatively and 3months postoperatively, operation time, sequential postoperative pain scale, and postoperative graft failure rate were evaluated., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The perforation size of the tympanic membrane in TET and EMT group was 22.3+/-10.9% and 23.5+/-9.7%, respectively (P=0.143). Mean operation time of EMT (92.3+/-16.5min) was longer than that of the TET (65.3+/-20.5min) with a statistical significance (P=0.004). Graft success rate in the TET and EMT group were 92.3% and 96.3%, respectively; the values were not significantly different (P=0.610). Pre- and postoperative audiometric results including bone and air conduction thresholds and air-bone gap were not significantly different between the groups. In all groups, the postoperative air-bone gap was significantly improved compared to the preoperative air-bone gap. Pain in the immediate postoperative and day 1 after surgery were significantly less in the TET group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: With human cadaveric ADA, minimal invasive endoscopic tympanoplasty can be achieved with similar postoperative results and less pain.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: We aimed to evaluate the subjective satisfaction after incus vibroplasty and to determine predictive factors affecting patient satisfaction in sensorineural hearing loss., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: A retrospective review of audiological data and an additional survey about subjective satisfaction after surgery were performed in 14 patients who underwent incus vibroplasty surgery. A numeric rating scale reflecting the degree of satisfaction after incus vibroplasty, compared with experiences using a conventional hearing aid, was used. Patients who showed median or better satisfaction were deemed the highly satisfied (HS) group, and the others were deemed the less satisfied (LS) group. To find the predictive factors correlated with satisfaction for incus vibroplasty, comparative analysis between two groups was performed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: We found that the numeric rating scale for satisfaction was variable, ranged from 0 to 10, and was negatively correlated with age at operation (p < 0.01). The HS group had a younger age (27.6 +/- 22.2 years) and better preoperative air conduction threshold at 250 Hz (20.7 +/- 7.9 dB) than the LS group (68.0 +/- 9.7 years, 32.1 +/- 10.7 dB). The LS group (13.6 +/- 9.9 dB) showed a larger change of air-bone gap after surgery than the HS group (5.7 +/- 6.7 dB) at 250 Hz (p = 0.12)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Age at operation and the preoperative air conduction threshold level at 250 Hz appear to be potential predictive factors for subjective satisfaction with incus vibroplasty. Furthermore, more conservative selection of candidates and caution during surgery, considering inevitable air-bone gap development postoperatively, may be necessary to achieve higher satisfaction for incus vibroplasty.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: To evaluate the influence of the diameter of stapes prosthesis on functional outcomes in stapes surgery., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective cohort study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Fifty consecutive small fenestra stapedotomies performed using a 0.4-mm-diameter prosthesis were compared with 50 consecutive small fenestra stapedotomies carried out using a 0.6-mm-diameter piston. Audiological assessment following the recommendations of the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium was performed 1 month after surgery. Postoperative complications between the two groups were noted., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There were no statistically significant differences in demographic data between the two groups, and no differences in preoperative bone-conduction (BC) or air-conduction (AC) hearing thresholds for all frequencies (analysis of variance [ANOVA] and chi<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> tests). No differences were found in the mean preoperative BC and AC pure-tone average and air-bone gap (ABG). In the postoperative evaluation, a statistically significant difference was found for the mean AC gain (20 +/- 8.7 vs. 24 +/- 11.5, P = .042, ANOVA) as well as for the postoperative AC threshold at 0.125 and 0.25 kHz and the postoperative BC threshold at 0.25 kHz (P < .01, ANOVA). A postoperative ABG <=10 dB was obtained in 90% and 94% of patients in the 0.4-mm- and 0.6-mm-diameter piston groups, respectively (difference not significant, chi<ovid:sup>2</ovid:sup> test). No postoperative dead ear and/or sensorineural hearing loss was noted in either group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The 0.6-mm piston allowed a statistically significant higher AC gain compared with the 0.4-mm diameter piston. A larger diameter piston may be preferable if there are no anatomical or technical reasons that would favor a smaller prosthesis., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 2b Laryngoscope, 1922-1926, 2018.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2017 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Despite the worldwide availability of endoscope in otology, it still has not replaced the microscopic surgery as it has for nose surgery. In 2008, we administered a questionnaire on the preference of using otoscopes in Korea. In light of the worldwide availability of endoscopic ear surgery, we have now conducted a more detailed survey to determine if this preference has changed over 8years., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A questionnaire consisting of 10 questions was used to survey members of the Korean Otological Society who were actively performing middle ear surgery. The responses to this questionnaire were compared to those from 2008. The study also determined the preference for endoscope use based on the surgeon's experience., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The mean surgical experience of the otologists was 12.7years. Endoscopy for tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy increased over a period of 8years. In the outpatient clinic, the use of endoscopy also increased; over 8-year period, it surpassed the microscope as the most preferred diagnostic tool in the outpatient clinic. Greater than half of the operating rooms were equipped with endoscopic sets; however, only 4.5% of otologists acknowledged having endoscopic instruments., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Endoscopy for surgery and in outpatient clinic assessment increased in otology in Korea; however, endoscopes have consistently been used as an adjuvant to the microscope to improve visualization of the tympanic cavity rather than as a tool for totally endoscopic ear surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2017.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Traumatic perforation of the tympanic membrane (TPTM) is often encountered in primary care or in the emergency department (ED). Several therapeutic interventions have been described, but conservative follow-up until spontaneous complete recovery is the most common choice., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Our goal was to analyze the trauma mechanism, perforation characteristics, and outcome of patients with TPTM., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The study included patients examined in the ED of a tertiary, university-affiliated medical center because of TPTM between 2012 and 2016. Their medical records were retrospectively reviewed for demographics, trauma mechanism, clinical characteristics, and outcome. A phone survey was performed to obtain the missing information of all the patients who did not continue their follow-up in our outpatient clinic., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: We reviewed the histories of 80 patients with a mean age of 26.7 +/- 14.6 years (20 children; 25%). TPTM was caused by blunt trauma in 45 patients (56%) and penetrating trauma in 35 patients (44%). Thirty-five patients (44%) completed their follow-up in the hospital outpatient clinic, with a mean duration of 6.2 weeks. Twenty-five patients (38%) completed their follow-up in a community-based otolaryngology clinic, 6 patients (9%) chose not to complete their follow-up, and 14 patients were lost to follow-up. Of the 60 patients who completed follow-up, 56 patients recovered spontaneously, 3 patients underwent successful tympanoplasty, and 1 patient was referred to surgery but was lost to follow-up. All children healed spontaneously., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: TPTM was more common in young males with main mechanisms of blunt trauma (an assault) or cleaning the ear canal. All children demonstrated complete spontaneous recovery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

N2  - The purpose of this study is to investigate what characteristics of tinnitus in patients with chronic otitis media was reduced after tympanoplasty and to assess the relationship between post-operative tinnitus reduction and pre-operative tinnitus tone, tinnitus duration, post-operative hearing recovery, and tympanogram. Medical records were prospective between March 2013 and May 2016. Audiologic evaluation by pure tone audiometry and acoustic impedance and tinnitus assessment using scores on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) was conducted preoperatively and 6 months post-operatively. The data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon test, Student's and paired t test, and ANOVA. The pre-operative incidence of tinnitus in patients with COM was 47%. There was a very significant difference between pre-operative and post-operative mean THI scores (p < 0.05). Tinnitus was reduced or alleviated in 83% of tinnitus patients. Pre-operative low-tone tinnitus was significantly reduced 6 months after surgery. After surgery, air-conducted hearing improvement at 250, 500, and 1000 Hz in the tinnitus significant recovery group was greater than the tinnitus non-significant recovery group (p < 0.05). Tinnitus reduction in tympanogram A was significantly greater than in tympanograms B or C (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant correlation between tinnitus duration and tinnitus reduction (p > 0.05). There was no significant effect of presence cholesteatoma and dry period on the gain THI (p > 0.05). The types of tympanoplasty had no effect on tinnitus improvement (p > 0.05). No patients experienced new tinnitus after surgery. Following tympanoplasty, most patients experienced a reduction in tinnitus. Pre-operative low-tone tinnitus is easier to reduce after tympanoplasty. Post-operative normal tympanogram and improved low-frequency AC hearing were important to tinnitus reduction.

N2  - Objective Endoscopic transcanal myringoplasty (ETM) has been an emerging technique for repairing tympanic perforations since the late 1990s. Objective outcomes (ie, graft success rates and hearing results) of patients who received ETM are well documented; however, subjective outcomes of these patients have rarely been reported. Hence, this study evaluated subjective and objective outcomes of patients who received ETM for repairing tympanic perforations. Study Design Prospective study. Setting Tertiary care university hospital. Patients and Methods Patients who underwent ETM for perforations of the tympanic membrane were included. We evaluated subjective variables of patients receiving ETM as the primary outcome and objective variables as the secondary outcome. Results In total, 91 ears that underwent ETM were included. The mean pain scale score was 0.1 (range, 0-2) on postoperative day 3. The mean duration of pain medication was 2.0 (range, 0-3) days. The mean number of days required to resume routine activities was 1.0 (range, 1-2) days. The overall graft success was determined postoperatively at 3 months in 80 of 91 ears (87.9%). Closure of the air-bone gap to within 20 dB was achieved in 79 (86.8%) ears. Conclusion In this study, patients who received ETM had mild postoperative pain and resumed routine activities early. These patients also exhibited favorable graft success rates and hearing results at 3 months postoperatively. On the basis of our results, we conclude that patients who receive ETM for the repair of tympanic perforations have favorable short-term subjective and objective outcomes.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Patients with Turner syndrome (TS) have craniofacial malformations, such as Eustachian tube hypoplasia and dysfunction and velar dysfunction, which foster acute otitis media. The aim of this study was to inventory pediatric otologic disorders in patients with TS at their first ENT consultation in our center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: We reviewed the ENT consultation data of pediatric TS patients followed in our center between 2005 and 2015: otoscopy, hearing threshold, and history of acute otitis media or ENT surgery. Data were compared according to karyotype: X monosomy (45,X), mosaic (45,X/46,XX), isochromosome (46,Xi [Xq]), X ring chromosome X (XrX), with Y material, and "other"., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Ninety patients, with mean age 11.9years (+/-4.8years) at first ENT consultation, were included: 29% showed tympanic abnormality on otoscopy, 21% had hearing loss, 24% had history of recurrent acute otitis media; 18% had undergone adenoidectomy, 24% T-tube insertion, and 5.6% tympanoplasty. No particular karyotype was associated with higher risk of hearing loss or acute otitis media., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Patients with TS showed high prevalence of pediatric otologic disorders; they therefore require close and prolonged ENT follow-up.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: One reason for insufficient hearing improvement with a distinct air-bone gap after ossiculoplasty with implantation of partial or total ossicular replacement prostheses can be the dislocation or minimal shifting of the prosthesis. The aim of this study was the simulation of common clinical borderline situations with minimal shifting of the prosthesis in temporal bone specimens after ossiculoplasty. It was furthermore the goal to identify these specific situations through imaging by cone beam computed tomography (cbCT) and direct visual inspection using the operation microscope. Additionally, the functional status was evaluated using laser-Doppler vibrometry (LDV)., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: We used a total of four temporal bone specimens for this study. A reconstruction with a partial ossicular replacement prostheses was performed in three specimens and with a total ossicular replacement prostheses in one specimen, with good initial acoustic properties. Subsequently, one specific type of prosthesis failure was simulated in each specimen, respectively, by minimally shifting, tilting, or bending the prostheses from their initial positions. These changes were introduced step-by-step until a borderline situation just short of complete acoustic decoupling was reached. Each step was examined using both LDV and cbCT and observed through the operation microscope., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: LDV was able to quantify the mechanic function of the ossicular chain after most of the manipulation steps by demonstrating the effect of any shifting of the prosthesis on the middle ear transfer function. However, in some situations, the middle ear transfer function was better with a visually more advanced failure of the prosthesis. In addition, cbCT showed most of the steps with excellent resolution and was able to delineate changes in soft tissue (e.g., cartilage covering)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: cbCT seems to be a promising imaging technique for middle ear problems. As cbCT and LDV exhibited slightly different advantages and disadvantages regarding the demonstration of borderline situations, the combination of both techniques allowed for a more precise evaluation of middle ear reconstructions. Knowledge of the specific characteristics of these methods and their possible combination might help otologists and otosurgeons to refine indications for revision surgery and improve their personal patient counseling.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Previous reports indicated that middle ear surgery might partially improve tinnitus after surgery. However, until now, no influencing factor has been determined for tinnitus outcome after middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between preoperative air-bone gap and tinnitus outcome after tympanoplasty type I., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Seventy-five patients with tinnitus who had more than 6 months of symptoms of chronic otitis media on the ipsilateral side that were refractory to medical treatment were included in this study. All patients were evaluated through otoendoscopy, pure tone/speech audiometer, questionnaire survey using the visual analog scale and the tinnitus handicap inventory for tinnitus symptoms before and 6 months after tympanoplasty. The influence of preoperative bone conduction, preoperative air-bone-gap, and postoperative air-bone-gap on tinnitus outcome after the operation was investigated., <ovid:b>RESULTS AND CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The patients were divided into two groups based on preoperative bone conduction of less than 25dB (n=50) or more than 25dB (n=25). The postoperative improvement of tinnitus in both groups showed statistical significance. Patients whose preoperative air-bone-gap was less than 15dB showed no improvement in postoperative tinnitus using the visual analog scale (p=0.889) and the tinnitus handicap inventory (p=0.802). However, patients whose preoperative air-bone-gap was more than 15dB showed statistically significant improvement in postoperative tinnitus using the visual analog scale (p<0.01) and the tinnitus handicap inventory (p=0.016). Postoperative change in tinnitus showed significance compared with preoperative tinnitus using visual analog scale (p=0.006). However, the correlation between reduction in the visual analog scale score and air-bone-gap (p=0.202) or between reduction in tinnitus handicap inventory score and air-bone-gap (p=0.290) was not significant. We suggest that the preoperative air-bone-gap can be a predictor of tinnitus outcome after tympanoplasty in chronic otitis media with tinnitus.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2017 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial.

N2  - We aim to demonstrate that regeneration of chronic tympanic perforations with heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) delivered by an injectable hydrogel restored hearing to levels similar to that of nonperforated tympanic membranes. Chronic tympanic membrane perforation is currently managed as an outpatient surgery with tympanoplasty. Due to the costs of this procedure in the developed world and a lack of accessibility and resources in developing countries, there is a great need for a new treatment that does not require surgery. In this study, we show in a mouse model through measurement of auditory brainstem response and distortion product otoacoustic emissions that tympanic perforations lead to hearing loss and this can be predominantly recovered with HB-EGF treatment (5 mug/mL). Our animal model suggests a return to function between 2 and 6 months after treatment. Auditory brainstem response thresholds had returned to the control levels at 2 months, but the distortion product otoacoustic emissions returned between 2 and 6 months. We also show how the vibration characteristics of the regenerated tympanic membrane, as measured by laser Doppler vibrometry, can be similar to that of an unperforated tympanic membrane. Using the best available methods for preclinical evaluation in animal models, it is likely that HB-EGF-like growth factor treatment leads to regeneration of chronic tympanic membrane perforations and restoration of the tympanic membrane to normal function, suggesting a potential route for nonsurgical treatment.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> To observe the clinical effect on the treatment of intractable tympanitis with reconstruction of external auditory canal wall. <ovid:b>Method:</ovid:b> Five cases underwent radical removel of residual lesion and reconsruction of external auditory posterior canal wall using hydroxyapatite ceramic wall with transferred pedicle temporalis fascia covering on it were analyzed. The implement of ossicular chain reconstruction depends on the probing for tympanic cavity intraoperatively. Periodic review were conducted in the 1st, 3rd, 6th, 12th month after surgery. <ovid:b>Result:</ovid:b> All 5 cases gained dryears within 3 months after surgery, in which hearing of 3 cases improved and ABG were within 20 dB. 1 cases showed no improvement compared to preoperation, and 1 case gained a worse audiology result. Central part of the transplant of 1 case was naked, while peripheral part had been epithelization and external auditory canal gained no accessible to mastoid cavity, the patient were also found recurrence of cholesteatom inside the mastoid cavity when received CT examination during outpatient follow-up one year postoperatively, and underwent correction surgery. 1 case underwent revision operation for a fistula between the reconstructed wall and the skin of the outer auditory canal. No surgical complications like infection or facial paralysis occurred, all patients were satisfied with surgery effect. <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> HA with transferred vascularized temporalis fascia pedicle for the reconstructon of the external auditory canal wall is an effective method for the treatment of intractable tympanitis, and worth promoting.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright&#xa9; by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To survey graduating residents or recent graduates of otolaryngology residency programs to evaluate their Otology/Neurotology (ON) experience in residency and discern if they had received adequate training in time to decide whether to pursue a fellowship in Otology or Neurotology., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Internet-based survey., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A survey was distributed to all US otolaryngology residency programs to distribute to 5th year residents and recent graduates in last 4 years. The survey assessed satisfaction in ON experience, presence of ON fellows, adequacy of experience to decide on ON fellowship, post-graduate year (PGY) year at which residents observed, performed, and proficiently performed five procedures (tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy, ossiculoplasty, stapedectomy, and cochlear implant), and plan for performing these surgeries in practice., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 89/106 (84%) of respondents felt they had adequate training in Otology in time to decide whether or not to pursue a fellowship and were found to observe and perform surgeries significantly earlier in training by PGY including: mastoidectomy (observed PGY 1.9 versus PGY 2.3, performed PGY 2.9 versus PGY 3.5), ossiculoplasty (observed 2.1 versus 3.0, performed 3.6 versus 4.3), stapedectomy (observed 2.3 versus 3.0, performed 3.9 versus 4.5), and cochlear implant (observed 2.1 versus 2.8, performed 3.4 versus 4.1) all p < 0.05. There were 19/106 (17.9%) respondents who came from programs with fellowships and 78.9% thought fellows were beneficial to their ON experience., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Early exposure to ON surgeries may aid in residents' decision to pursue a fellowship in ON. The presence of fellows appears to facilitate residents' ON experience.

N2  - Many techniques and graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the tympanic membrane. We conducted a retrospective study to compare anatomic and functional outcomes of type 1 tympanoplasty that we performed with boomerang-shaped chondroperichondrial cartilage grafts (BSGs) and shield-shaped chondroperichondrial cartilage grafts (SSGs) in pediatric patients. Our study population was made up 121 patients-61 boys and 60 girls, aged 7 to 16 years (mean: 12.4)-who had undergone a type 1 tympanoplasty. Patients were divided into two groups according to the grafting technique used; there were 59 patients in the BSG group and 62 patients in the SSG group. Ear examinations were performed at postoperative months 3, 6, 12, and 24, and pure-tone average (PTA) for air-conduction threshold values and air-bone gaps (ABGs) were evaluated at 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 kHz at the same visits. We also investigated the impact of the graft material on functional graft success and intergroup differences (if any) in surgical success. Mean postoperative follow-up periods were 30.5 and 30.2 months in the BSG and SSG groups, respectively. We found that the success rates for tympanic membrane reconstruction were not significantly different in the two groups (91.5 and 88.7%). Postoperatively, the mean PTA and ABG values in both groups at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were significantly lower than the preoperative values (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in mean PTA values between the two groups at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. However, the extent of the decrease in PTA values in the BSG group at 3 months was significantly greater than that of the SSG group (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in mean ABG values between the two groups at 3, 6, and 12 months, but at 24 months, the value was significantly higher in the BSG group (p < 0.05). Finally, the extent of the decrease in ABG in the BSG group at both 3 and 6 months was significantly greater than that of the SSG group (p < 0.05). We conclude that the BSG procedure is a reliable and safe method of performing pediatric tympanoplasty.

N2  - Aim of the present study is to evaluate the long term results of ossiculoplasty using titanium clip prosthesis. A retrospective analysis with prospective follow-up has been done including for all patients who had a Clip-PORP implanted between the years 2002-2013. Following this, audiometric hearing results were measured with clinical examination including otoscopy and quality of life evaluation using Glasgow benefit inventory. 48 patients (51 ears, 29 men, 19 women, average age 44.1 years) received followed up after an average duration of 6.3 years. The overall air-bone-gap (0.5-4 kHz) decreased from 22.8 dB preoperatively to 14.6 dB postoperatively (p<=0.001). The most frequent indication for surgical treatment were cholesteatomas and recurrent cholesteatomas (52%), chronic inflammation of middle ear (12%), revision of radical mastoidectomy (8%) and disturbance in sound conduction after previous operation (14%). Tympanic membrane was closed in 47 times (92,2%), 4 times (7,8%) there was a defect. Clip-PORP was in situ 39 times (75%), protrusion and disposal were detected 6 times (11,8%) and 2 times (4%), respectively. However, 1 time (2%) the prothesis was lost or evaluation was not possible (3 times, 5,9%). The overall patient satisfaction and general subscale score after the treatment was beneficially evaluated. There was no change in social support score nore the physical health score. In summary, the ossicular chain reconstruction using titan Clip-PORP is safe and well established. Also in long-term analysis stable hearing results due to reduction of air bone gap are represented. The subjective quality of life is sustainable improved.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION AND AIM</ovid:b>: The reason of gradually developing conductive hearing loss in otosclerotic patients is the ossification of the stapes footplate to the surrounding bony structures and the therapy of stapes fixation is mainly surgical. In stapedotomy the footplate of the stapes is fenestrated with laser and microdrill in a diameter of 0.8 mm, whereas in stapedectomy there is complete removal of the footplate followed by the reconstruction of the ossicular chain. In the early postoperative period, temporary vertigo is frequently recorded which significantly influences the recovery., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: In the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Pecs both stapedectomy and stapedotomy were performed on a daily basis between 01.02.2010 and 15.03.2012. Our study focused on comparing the degree of postoperative vertigo after the two types of surgery. We hypothesized that the smaller fenestration of the stapes footplate during stapedotomy limits exposure to the inner ear reducing the severity of dizziness. Vertigo was evaluated subjectively with a retrospective questionnaire and objectively with static posturography., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: On the 1st postoperative day, significantly fewer patients reported vertigo in the stapedotomy group and with significantly lower intensity. Results of the questionnaire regarding the later postoperative period showed no significant differences between the groups. Based on the analysis of the posturography test results, no significant difference was detected between the postoperative stability of the two groups. Results of the questionnaire and the posturography showed no correlation. Posturography test results did not confirm the presence of subjective vertigo., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Many factors may play a role in the development of vertigo after stapes surgery, but the type of intervention does not influence it.

N2  - Objective First, to survey our national otolaryngology colleagues on their postoperative care habits (hospitalization vs day surgery) after elective middle ear surgery. Second, to evaluate the necessity of hospitalization and safety of day surgery after these procedures. Methods A national survey regarding postoperative habits after elective middle ear surgery was launched. Then, the cases of all patients having undergone these surgical procedures at our center between 2010 and 2016 were reviewed. They were divided into 2 groups: hospitalization and day surgery. Postoperative events during hospitalization and rate of consultation/readmission for day surgery were recorded. Results Heterogeneity in postoperative habits for most elective otologic surgery exists among otolaryngologists. For tympanoplasty, however, day surgery was uniformly favored. At our institution, 88.6% of hospitalization patients had no complications during their stay. Complications noted for others were nausea (7.2%), bleeding (3.1%), hematoma (0.5%), and sensorineural hearing loss (0.5%). In the day surgery group, 3.0% consulted within 48 hours following their procedure, and the readmission rate was 1.3%. Nausea was the only cause for readmission, and stapes surgery accounted for 100% of readmissions. Discussion Most elective middle ear surgery can be safely performed as day care. Hospitalization does not provide care that could not have been provided at home in the majority of cases. Overnight hospital stay may be considered for stapes surgery. Implications for Practice Day surgery for elective middle ear surgery is sufficient for most cases. Transferring these cases to day care should lower costs to our health care system and increase bed availability.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - The aim of this study was to compare the audiologic outcomes of the patients who underwent endoscopy on one ear and microscopic tympanoplasty on the other, and to investigate the operative time, graft success, postoperative pain and health status. This prospective randomized controlled study was carried out in Ege University ENT Department between February 2015 and September 2016. The patients who had bilateral chronic otitis media, normal middle ear mucosa and a hearing loss difference of 10 dB or less between the two ears randomly underwent microscopic tympanoplasty in one ear and endoscopic tympanoplasty in the contralateral ear, with 6-month intervals. 13 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 36.17 +/- 3.61 years (range 17-53 years, 7 female, 6 male). The improvement in air-bone gap for groups 1 (endoscopic) and 2 (microscopic) was 9.48 +/- 5.23 and 9.89 +/- 2.79 dB, respectively. The duration of the surgery in group 1 was significantly lower than that in group 2 (p < 0.01). VAS scores were 2.15 +/- 0.37 and 3.76 +/- 1.64 cm for groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.006). The endoscopic approach for type 1 tympanoplasty offers shorter surgery time, better health status and lower postoperative pain than microscopic surgery. In addition, endoscopic surgery offers comparable improvement in air-bone gap and similar graft success. The endoscopic approach has comparable audiological and morphological graft outcomes with the microscopic one. The endoscopic approach yielded better health and pain status for the same patients. Level of evidence This is an individual randomized controlled trial. The level of evidence is 1b.

N2  - Sensorineural losses of hearing and vestibular sensation due to hair cell dysfunction are among the most common disabilities. Recent preclinical research demonstrates that treatment of the inner ear with a variety of compounds, including gene therapy agents, may elicit regeneration and/or repair of hair cells in animals exposed to ototoxic medications or other insults to the inner ear. Delivery of gene therapy may also offer a means for treatment of hereditary hearing loss. However, injection of a fluid volume sufficient to deliver an adequate dose of a pharmacologic agent could, in theory, cause inner ear trauma that compromises functional outcome. The primary goal of the present study was to assess that risk in rhesus monkeys, which closely approximates humans with regard to middle and inner ear anatomy. Secondary goals were to identify the best delivery route into the primate ear from among two common surgical approaches (i.e., via an oval window stapedotomy and via the round window) and to determine the relative volumes of rhesus, rodent, and human labyrinths for extrapolation of results to other species. We measured hearing and vestibular functions before and 2, 4, and 8 weeks after unilateral injection of phosphate-buffered saline vehicle (PBSV) into the perilymphatic space of normal rhesus monkeys at volumes sufficient to deliver an atoh1 gene therapy vector. To isolate effects of injection, PBSV without vector was used. Assays included behavioral observation, auditory brainstem responses, distortion product otoacoustic emissions, and scleral coil measurement of vestibulo-ocular reflexes during whole-body rotation in darkness. Three groups (N = 3 each) were studied. Group A received a 10 muL transmastoid/trans-stapes injection via a laser stapedotomy. Group B received a 10 muL transmastoid/trans-round window injection. Group C received a 30 muL transmastoid/trans-round window injection. We also measured inner ear fluid space volume via 3D reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images of adult C57BL6 mouse, rat, rhesus macaque, and human temporal bones (N = 3 each). Injection was well tolerated by all animals, with eight of nine exhibiting no signs of disequilibrium and one animal exhibiting transient disequilibrium that resolved spontaneously by 24 h after surgery. Physiologic results at the final, 8-week post-injection measurement showed that injection was well tolerated. Compared to its pretreatment values, no treated ear's ABR threshold had worsened by more than 5 dB at any stimulus frequency; distortion product otoacoustic emissions remained detectable above the noise floor for every treated ear (mean, SD and maximum deviation from baseline: -1.3, 9.0, and -18 dB, respectively); and no animal exhibited a reduction of more than 3 % in vestibulo-ocular reflex gain during high-acceleration, whole-body, passive yaw rotations in darkness toward the treated side. All control ears and all operated ears with definite histologic evidence of injection through the intended site showed similar findings, with intact hair cells in all five inner ear sensory epithelia and intact auditory/vestibular neurons. The relative volumes of mouse, rat, rhesus, and human inner ears as measured by CT were (mean +/- SD) 2.5 +/- 0.1, 5.5 +/- 0.4, 59.4 +/- 4.7 and 191.1 +/- 4.7 muL. These results indicate that injection of PBSV at volumes sufficient for gene therapy delivery can be accomplished without destruction of inner ear structures required for hearing and vestibular sensation.

N2  - The meatoplasty of the external auditory canal is a frequently performed otologic procedure in recurrent otitis externa, eczema or frequent accumulation of cerumen due to a narrow meatus of the external ear canal. Numerous surgical techniques have been described. The M-meatoplasty described by Mirck for addressing the external meatus is widely used. However, this technique does not sufficiently enlarge the external ear canal in all cases. Specifically in patients where the ear canal narrowing is most prominent in the postero- and/or anterosuperior quadrants of the lateral meatus the technique needs some modifications. In these cases, an oblique conversion of the M-meatoplasty, the MO-meatocanalplasty, is useful. In cases where the bony canal is also narrow this modification allows for a bony canalplasty while avoiding a retro-auricular approach. The MO-meatocanalplasty can be used in combination with myringoplasty and tympanoplasty.

A questionnaire specifically designed to investigate the understanding of middle ear anatomy, the surgical steps, and a personal opinion about endoscopic stapes surgery was submitted to each resident., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Statistical differences between the endoscopic and microscopic approaches were evident about identification of stapes and long process of the incus (p=0.03) and stapes footplate and the oval window (p=0.03). No substantial difference between the two surgical approaches emerged regarding the visualization of the tympanic membrane and the other middle ear structures (p>0.5). A substantial difference in favor of the endoscopic approach emerged regarding the identification of the hole creation in the footplate of the stapes., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic stapes surgery could favor an easier understanding of the surgical technique for assistants in training with little knowledge of the anatomy and surgical steps.

N2  - The objective of the present study was to characterize the epidemiological variants of tympanosclerosis and the effectiveness of the surgical treatment of the patients presenting with this condition. We have undertaken the analysis of the results of 1965 surgical interventions on the patients suffering from different forms of chronic otitis media (COM) performed during the period from 2009 till 2014 with a view to determining the frequency of tympanosclerosis (TSC). In 542 cases, it proved possible to evaluate the intraoperative findings, stages and methods of reconstructive surgery, the anatomical and functional outcomes and effectiveness of the intervention. At present, the signs of tympanosclerosis are identified in 27.6% of the patients presenting with chronic otitis media including 88.7% and 11.3% suffering from the perforating and non-perforating forms of this pathology, respectively. In 74% of the cases its manifestations are diagnosed in the patients having the tubotympanic form of COM. In 53.3% of the patients TSC foci are responsible for the fixation of the ossicular chain whereas in 46.7% of the cases the auditory ossicles retain mobility. As many as 88.6% of the patients underwent the one-step surgical intervention, 10.7% were managed using two-step surgery, and 0.7% of the patients were given the three-stage treatment. Type I tympanoplasty was performed in 62% of the patients, type III tympanoplasty in 30.4%, and various types of stapedoplasty in 4.6% of the cases. The favourable anatomical and functional outcomes at the first stage of the surgical intervention with the use of the autogenous tissues for tympano- and ossiculoplastic surgery were achieved in 87.9% of the patients on the average (by means of the closure of the tympanic defect in 92.2% and by re-fixation of the selected elements of the ossicular chain in 17.3%of the cases). The anatomical and functional effectiveness of the second-stage surgical intervention was estimated at 93.1%.

N2  - Techniques and biomaterials for reconstructive middle ear surgery are under steady, ongoing development. At the same time, clinical post-surgery results are evaluated to determine success or failure of the therapy. Routine quality assessment and assurance is of growing importance in the medical field, and therefore also in middle ear surgery. The exact definition and acquisition of outcome parameters is essential for both a comprehensive and detailed quality assurance. These parameters are not the audiological results alone, but also additional individual parameters which influence the postoperative outcome after tympanoplasty. Selection of patients and the preoperative clinical situation, the extent of the ossicular chain destruction, the chosen reconstruction technique and material, the audiometric frequency selection and the observational interval are only some of them. If these parameters are not well documented comparative analyses between different studies are of limited value. The present overview aims to describe, compare and evaluate some of the existing assessment and scoring systems for middle ear surgery. Additionally, new methods for an intraoperative quality assessment in ossiculoplasty and the postoperative evaluation of suboptimal hearing results with imaging techniques are available. In the area of implant development functional elements were integrated in prostheses to enable not only good sound transmission but also compensation of occurring atmospheric pressure changes. In combination with other components for ossicular repair they can be used in a modular manner which, so far show experimentally and clinically promising results.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Positive airway pressure (PAP) devices are used as treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). PAP may increase middle ear pressure which is of interest to otologic surgeons. There is a lack of data to guide management of PAP therapy after middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To elucidate how otologic surgeons manage PAP in their patients after ear surgery., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A survey e-mailed to practicing members of the American Neurotology Society., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Among 60 respondents, the most common recommendations to patients were to avoid PAP use for 1 week (40%), return to normal use immediately (23.3%), avoid PAP for 1 month (13.3%), or avoid PAP for 1 day (13.3%) after surgery. Twenty percent of providers reported that they change their advice on the basis of the PAP pressure settings (i.e., shorter hiatus for higher settings). Among respondents, 47% think that they have patients with middle ear issues because of PAP and 13% attributed surgical failures to PAP use. One-third of providers routinely pack the Eustachian tube during surgery. Providers who attributed a negative surgical outcome to PAP use were more likely to routinely pack/plug the Eustachian tube during otologic surgery (p = 0.001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Treatment recommendations regarding postoperative PAP treatment for obstructive sleep apnea vary greatly among practicing otologists. Providers who think that an adverse outcome was attributed to PAP use were more likely to prophylactically plug the Eustachian tube during surgery. Future research will provide additional information which will allow a better understanding of the effect of PAP on the middle ear, especially after otologic surgery.

N2  - Functional outcomes and complications in otosclerosis surgery are governed by the surgeon's experience. Thus, teaching the procedure to residents to guide them through the learning process as quickly as possible is challenging. Artificial 3D-printed temporal bones are replacing cadaver specimens in many institutions to learn mastoidectomy, but these are not suitable for middle ear surgery training. The goal of this work was to adapt such an artificial temporal bone to aid the teaching of otosclerosis surgery and to evaluate this tool. We have modified a commercially available 3D-printed temporal bone by replacing the incus and stapes of the model with in-house 3D-printed ossicles. The incus could be attached to a 6-axis force sensor. The stapes footplate was fenestrated and attached to a 1-axis force sensor. Six junior surgeons (residents) and seven senior surgeons (fellows or consultants) were enrolled to perform piston prosthesis placement and crimping as performed during otosclerosis surgery. The time required to perform the tasks and the forces applied to the incus and stapes were collected and analyzed. No statistically significant differences were observed between the junior and senior groups for time taken to perform the tasks and the forces applied to the incus during crimping and placement of the prosthesis. However, significantly lower forces were applied to the stapes by the senior surgeons in comparison with the junior surgeons during prosthesis placement (junior vs senior group, 328 +/- 202.9 vs 80 +/- 99.6 mN, p = 0.008) and during prosthesis crimping (junior vs senior group, 565 +/- 233 vs 66 +/- 48.6 mN, p = 0.02). We have described a new teaching tool for otosclerosis surgery based on the modification of a 3D-printed temporal bone to implement force sensors on the incus and stapes. This tool could be used as a training tool to help the residents to self-evaluate their progress with recording of objective measurements.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Analyze the presentation and evolution of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) in children with cochlear implants (CI) and explore the merit of early intervention., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective patient review., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral hospital and cochlear implant programme., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Children with a CI who developed CSOM., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Disease control, recurrence of cholesteatoma, cochlear implant preservation., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Eight children fit our inclusion criteria with a mean follow up of 8 years. Onset of CSOM symptoms was observed on an average of 5 years after implantation (range, 2-13 yr) and led to surgical intervention in an average of 15.6 months following symptom onset. Cholesteatoma was found in four of the eight patients. Of these, one patient underwent a subtotal petrosectomy and explantation with reimplantation at the same stage but the reimplant failed to function and was explanted subsequently. One patient was initially managed by a canal wall up mastoidectomy and explantation but went on to require subtotal petrosectomy and labyrinthectomy for recurrent disease. One patient underwent a subtotal petrosectomy with explantation and is awaiting a reimplantation. The fourth patient had limited disease around the electrodes that was excised without compromising the implant. In the group of patients with CSOM without cholesteatoma, one underwent an explantation due to recurrent ear infections and a subsequent cartilage tympanoplasty for a retracted eardrum. The remaining three patients underwent successful excision of retraction pockets and repair of eardrums using cartilage with the implant in situ. A mean follow up of 2 years after the implant preservation surgeries shows good functioning of the CI., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Early recognition of CSOM is paramount in patients with CI as delay in treatment can result in the infection spreading via the cochleostomy resulting in loss of the cochlea. Recurrent ear infections in an implanted ear should prompt early examination to exclude the presence of middle ear disease, which may require anesthesia in a young child.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Residual cholesteatoma most frequently occurs where visualization and surgical access are restricted by anatomic constraints. Other factors that compromise surgical field visualization might also increase rates of residual cholesteatoma. We evaluated whether impaired surgical field clarity from bleeding increases rates of residual cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective cohort study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary care hospital., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Consecutive series of children having intact canal wall surgery for cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Impact of bleeding on surgical field clarity was assessed intraoperatively on a six-point scale., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Presence of residual cholesteatoma was established at follow up clinical encounters, second stage procedures, and with magnetic resonance imaging. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the influence of surgical field clarity and other factors on rates of residual cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Surgery was completed on 232 ears and residual cholesteatoma found in 45 (19%) ears. Multivariate regression analysis of cases completed with atticotomy or tympanoplasty demonstrated that surgical field clarity was a significant predictor of residual cholesteatoma (OR [odds ratio] 4, 95%CI 1.05-15; p = 0.04). Cholesteatoma extent was the most significant predictor of residual cholesteatoma when including cases requiring combined approach tympanomastoidectomy (OR 2.2, 95%CI 1.4-3.3; p < 0.001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Impaired surgical field clarity from intraoperative bleeding is associated with increased risk of residual cholesteatoma in surgery for meso/epitympanic cholesteatoma. These findings are of particular significance for endoscopic ear surgery in which management of bleeding can be more difficult and support the use of techniques, such as hypotensive general anesthesia, that minimize surgical site bleeding and improve surgical field visualization.

N2  - Endonasal ballon dilatation of the Eustachian tube (BET) is a promising treatment for Eustachian tube dysfunction with encouraging results over the last years in adults. In addition, in children, single studies demonstrated promising results, but revealed the necessity for broader and additional studies. Our retrospective analysis presents outcomes with BET in children with chronic obstructive dysfunction of the Eustachian tube, showing resistance to the conventional therapy after adenotomy with paracentesis or grommets (ventilation tubes). The data of 52 children, having undergone BET from April 2011 to April 2016, were retrospectively evaluated. Most children in our study presented middle ear effusion (47%), adhesive (21%), chronic otitis media (13%), or recurrent acute otitis media (11%). In 24 (37%) children, we combined BET with a paracentesis, in 5 (8%) patients with a tympanoplasty type I and in 3 (5%) patients with a type III. All children were assessed using an audiogram, tympanometry, and tubomanometry (50 mbar) before and after BET. In addition, we evaluated the results of the Lubecker questionnaire, which we performed before and after BET. The childrens' ear-related and quality of life-related symptoms, such as pressure equalization, ear pressure, hearing loss, pain and limitation in daily life, and satisfaction pre- and postoperatively, were analyzed. In the majority of patients, we could see an improvement in the ear pressure, hearing loss, limitation in daily life, and satisfaction with recurrent inflammations, underlined by better outcomes in the tubomanometry and the tympanogram. BET in children is a safe, efficient, and promising method to treat chronic tube dysfunction, especially as a second line treatment, when adenotomy, paracentesis, or grommets failed before.

N1  - Erratum in (EIN)
N2  - Objective This update of the 2008 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation cerumen impaction clinical practice guideline provides evidence-based recommendations on managing cerumen impaction. Cerumen impaction is defined as an accumulation of cerumen that causes symptoms, prevents assessment of the ear, or both. Changes from the prior guideline include a consumer added to the development group; new evidence (3 guidelines, 5 systematic reviews, and 6 randomized controlled trials); enhanced information on patient education and counseling; a new algorithm to clarify action statement relationships; expanded action statement profiles to explicitly state quality improvement opportunities, confidence in the evidence, intentional vagueness, and differences of opinion; an enhanced external review process to include public comment and journal peer review; and 3 new key action statements on managing cerumen impaction that focus on primary prevention, contraindicated intervention, and referral and coordination of care. Purpose The primary purpose of this guideline is to help clinicians identify patients with cerumen impaction who may benefit from intervention and to promote evidence-based management. Another purpose of the guideline is to highlight needs and management options in special populations or in patients who have modifying factors. The guideline is intended for all clinicians who are likely to diagnose and manage patients with cerumen impaction, and it applies to any setting in which cerumen impaction would be identified, monitored, or managed. The guideline does not apply to patients with cerumen impaction associated with the following conditions: dermatologic diseases of the ear canal; recurrent otitis externa; keratosis obturans; prior radiation therapy affecting the ear; previous tympanoplasty/myringoplasty, canal wall down mastoidectomy, or other surgery affecting the ear canal. Key Action Statements The panel made a strong recommendation that clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, cerumen impaction, defined as an accumulation of cerumen that is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. The panel made the following recommendations: (1) Clinicians should explain proper ear hygiene to prevent cerumen impaction when patients have an accumulation of cerumen. (2) Clinicians should diagnose cerumen impaction when an accumulation of cerumen, as seen on otoscopy, is associated with symptoms, prevents needed assessment of the ear, or both. (3) Clinicians should assess the patient with cerumen impaction by history and/or physical examination for factors that modify management, such as >=1 of the following: anticoagulant therapy, immunocompromised state, diabetes mellitus, prior radiation therapy to the head and neck, ear canal stenosis, exostoses, and nonintact tympanic membrane. (4) Clinicians should not routinely treat cerumen in patients who are asymptomatic and whose ears can be adequately examined. (5) Clinicians should identify patients with obstructing cerumen in the ear canal who may not be able to express symptoms (young children and cognitively impaired children and adults), and they should promptly evaluate the need for intervention. (6) Clinicians should perform otoscopy to detect the presence of cerumen in patients with hearing aids during a health care encounter. (7) Clinicians should treat, or refer to a clinician who can treat, the patient with cerumen impaction with an appropriate intervention, which may include >=1 of the following: cerumenolytic agents, irrigation, or manual removal requiring instrumentation. (8) Clinicians should recommend against ear candling for treating or preventing cerumen impaction. (9) Clinicians should assess patients at the conclusion of in-office treatment of cerumen impaction and document the resolution of impaction. If the impaction is not resolved, the clinician should use additional treatment. If full or partial symptoms persist despite resolution of impaction, the clinician should evaluate the patient for alternative diagnoses. (10) Finally, if initial management is unsuccessful, clinicians should refer patients with persistent cerumen impaction to clinicians who have specialized equipment and training to clean and evaluate ear canals and tympanic membranes. The panel offered the following as options: (1) Clinicians may use cerumenolytic agents (including water or saline solution) in the management of cerumen impaction. (2) Clinicians may use irrigation in the management of cerumen impaction. (3) Clinicians may use manual removal requiring instrumentation in the management of cerumen impaction. (4) Last, clinicians may educate/counsel patients with cerumen impaction or excessive cerumen regarding control measures.

N2  - The aim of this study was to examine the functional hearing results regarding speech perception and auditory sound localization in a high-resolution directional hearing setup following implantation with a new bone conduction device (MED-EL Bonebridge, Innsbruck, Austria). In addition, we assessed the patient acceptance of the Bonebridge system using a questionnaire. The study design is retrospective study. The setting is University Hospital Frankfurt. 18 patients implanted with a Bonebridge device from May 2012 to January 2015 were participated in this study. Speech perception in quiet was tested with the Freiburg monosyllable test at a presentation level of 65 dB SPL. Speech perception in noise was tested post-operatively with the Oldenburg sentence test (OLSA) in best-aided condition. We assessed auditory sound localization with a high-resolution directional hearing setup. To evaluate the acceptance by patients using the Bonebridge in daily life, we used a modified questionnaire. The overall average of functional hearing gain (n = 18) was 29.3 dB (+/-20.7 dB). Speech perception of monosyllabic words in quiet improved by 20.7% on average, compared with the pre-operative aided condition. Mean speech reception thresholds (SRTs) of the Oldenburg sentence test (OLSA) improved significantly from -3.8 dB SNR (range -5.7 to 5.8 dB SNR) to -5.2 dB SNR (range -6.3 to -0.6 dB SNR) after implantation. Regarding localization abilities, no significant difference was found between the unaided and aided conditions following Bonebridge implantation. A survey of patients' acceptance and handling of the Bonebridge implant in daily life revealed high patient satisfaction. All patients accepted and benefited from the implanted system. No infections or adverse surgical effects occurred. Speech perception significantly improved in quiet and in noise. No significant difference in sound localization was observed. Acceptance of the Bonebridge implant, tested with a modified questionnaire, was high.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Many factors may influence the surgical outcome of tympanoplasty in children, including age, the size and location of perforation, otorrhea, status of contralateral ear, surgical technique, and adenoid hypertrophy. This study aims to evaluate the outcomes of pediatric cartilage tympanoplasty and to assess the factors that affect the success of tympanoplasty in children., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Children with chronic otitis media who underwent tympanoplasty using cartilage as graft material were evaluated retrospectively. Patient age, gender, size and site of the perforation, status of the contralateral ear, preoperative and postoperative hearing levels, surgical technique, and postoperative complications were noted., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of the 72 patients included in the study, 27 were male and 35 were female. The average age was 13.22 +/- 2.64 and mean follow-up time was 18.4 +/- 8.62 months. Anatomic and functional success rates were 88.8% and 80.6%, respectively. Age, gender, and the status of the contralateral ear had no effect on surgical success rate. The mean preoperative and postoperative pure-tone averages were 33.2 6+/- 10.37 and 21.00 +/- 13.25 dB, respectively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Anatomic and functional outcomes of cartilage tympanoplasty are quite satisfactory in pediatric patients. Chronic otitis media should be treated surgically as early as when patient cooperation is possible.

After confirming its suitability, we developed a surgical training program for canaloplasty, myringoplasty, and ossiculoplasty. From March 1 to May 31, 2016, the ex vivo model was tested, assessing the time needed for dissection and complications. Each experience was subjectively validated on a scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (excellent)., <ovid:b>Main Outcomes and Measures</ovid:b>: Suitability of the lamb model for training in exclusive endoscopic ear surgery., <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b>: We assessed the suitability of our novel lamb model on 20 ovine middle ears. All interventions could be performed in a satisfactory manner. The mean (SD) time required to perform canaloplasty was 29.7 (13.2) minutes, for middle ear dissection was 7.7 (2.6) minutes, for myringoplasty was 7.7 (4.3) minutes, and for ossiculoplasty was 10.4 (2.7) minutes. The time required for canaloplasty and tympano-meatal flap elevation during dissection decreased from 46.4 minutes in the first 5 cases to 16.2 minutes in the last 5 cases, representing an absolute difference of 30.2 minutes (95% CI, 22.28-38.12). Subjective ratings revealed excellent values for tissue quality (8.9 points of 10), overall satisfaction (8.3 points), and the learning experience (8.8 points)., <ovid:b>Conclusions and Relevance</ovid:b>: The ovine model is suitable for endoscopic ear surgery. We describe a novel, exclusively endoscopic approach in an ex vivo animal model for middle ear surgery. The proposed surgical program leads the trainee step by step through the main otologic procedures and is able to enhance his or her surgical skills.

N2  - Chondrodysplasia punctata (CP) is a systemic disorder of chondrogenesis. The most prominent features of patients with CP are abnormal faces characterized by a flat nose and short stature. CP patients show various types and levels of hearing loss. This disease is rare, and no successful tympanoplasties with hearing recovery have been reported. Here, we report on a CP case, in which hearing recovery was successfully treated with tympanoplasty.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To analyse the anatomical, functional and quality-of-life results when using bioactive glass in mastoid and epitympanic obliteration., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective clinical study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral centre., <ovid:b>PARTICIPANTS</ovid:b>: Forty-one cases (39 patients) operated between May 2013 and January 2015., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Anatomical results were evaluated by otomicroscopy 1 year after surgery and using imaging to detect residual disease. Functional results were studied by postoperative hearing gain. Quality of life was assessed with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory questionnaire and the success of surgery by a surgery-specific questionnaire., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: At 1 year, all patients presented a well-healed external auditory canal, with an intact tympanic membrane. In cases with cholesteatoma (n = 23), no recurrent retraction pockets or residual disease were observed on imaging studies. The overall air-bone gap closure was 7.7 +/- 1.84 dB (mean +/- se of the mean, P < 0.001, paired t-test). No significant differences were found on hearing results when comparing primary versus revision surgery, canal-wall-up versus canal-wall-down obliterations, type of tympanoplasty and presence of cholesteatoma (multifactor anova). The Glasgow Benefit Inventory improved with an average score of 28 and the success of surgery questionnaire showed a significant improvement in ear discharge and a moderate improvement in hearing and equilibrium., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The use of bioactive glass for mastoid and epitympanic obliteration in canal-wall-down or canal-wall-up tympanoplasties is an effective procedure in both primary and revision surgery. The anatomical and functional results appear to be well correlated with patient experience and to the improvement in quality of life.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The incidence of taste disturbance after stapes surgery is high (61.9%), whereas the majority (94.8%) recovers within 1 year. More severe surgical nerve trauma caused more disturbance, implying that the nerve should be handled carefully during surgery., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Patients operated on for otosclerosis seem more often to complain about post-operative taste disturbance than those operated on for chronic otitis media, although the chorda tympani nerve more seldom becomes maltreated in stapedotomy. These observations seem paradoxical. It is unclear to what extent a post-operative taste disturbance affects the quality-of-life. This study aims to shed light on the occurrence of post-operative taste disturbances, on possible prognostic factors, and to what extent post-operative taste disturbance impairs the quality-of-life., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: One hundred and thirty-four adults undergoing primary stapedotomy were included. Questionnaires on taste disturbance and quality-of-life (SF-36) were answered before and after surgery, until 1 year post-operatively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Eighty-three (61.9%) study persons reported post-operative taste disturbance. Seven (5.2%) reported persisting disturbance at 1 year. Surgically more traumatized chorda tympani nerves correlated with more severe taste disturbance post-operatively than less traumatized. Taste disturbance at 1 year post-operatively correlate with a decrease of the physical function domain in the SF-36.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: In the last decade, there has been an increasing use of cartilage grafts in the primary repair of tympanic membrane perforations. The major advantages of cartilage are its stiffness and its very low metabolic requirements, which make it particularly suitable for difficult conditions, such as subtotal perforations, adhesive otitis and reoperation., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To analyze the impact of different perforation sizes requiring different sizes of cartilage on the anatomical and functional outcome after tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Through this prospective non-controlled, non-randomized study, 50 patients underwent cartilage type 1 tympanoplasty (20 females and 30 males), with a mean age of 19.3+/-9.8 years. According to size of perforation, patients were subdivided into three groups, Group I had perforation >50% of tympanic membrane area, in Group II patients the perforations were 25-50% of tympanic membrane area, and in Group III the perforations were <=25% of tympanic membrane. All patients had pre and postoperative Pure Tone Average and Air Bone Gap frequencies (0.5, 1, 2, 4kHz). All patients were followed up at least 12 months after operation., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The anatomical success rate among all patients was 92%, all groups showed statistical significant improvement between pre and postoperative air bone gap, no significant correlation between size of cartilage graft and degree of air bone gap improvement was noticed among the three groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Size of a cartilage graft has no impact on degree of hearing improvement or anatomical success rate after tympanoplasty.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Endoscopic procedures are becoming common in middle ear surgery. Inflammation due to chronic ear disease can cause bony erosion of the carotid artery and Fallopian canals, making them more vulnerable during surgery. The objective of this study was to determine whether or not chronic ear disease increases dehiscence of the carotid artery and Fallopian canals., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Comparative human temporal bone study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Otopathology laboratory., <ovid:b>PARTICIPANTS</ovid:b>: We selected 78 temporal bones from 55 deceased donors with chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma and then compared those two groups with a control group of 27 temporal bones from 19 deceased donors with no middle ear disease., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: We analysed the middle ear, carotid artery canal and Fallopian canal, looking for signs of dehiscence of its bony coverage, using light microscopy., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: We found an increased incidence in dehiscence of the carotid artery and Fallopian canals in temporal bones with chronic middle ear disease. The size of the carotid artery canal dehiscence was larger in the middle ear-diseased groups, and its bony coverage, when present, was also thinner compared to the control group. Dehiscence of the carotid artery canal was more frequently located closer to the promontory. The incidence of Fallopian canal dehiscence was significantly higher in temporal bones from donors older than 18 years with chronic middle ear disease., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The increased incidence of the carotid artery and Fallopian canal dehiscence in temporal bones with chronic middle ear disease elevates the risk of adverse events during middle ear surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

N2  - A settings-based approach is now well-established in health promotion, initially undertaken in conventional places like schools and workplaces, but more recently being expressed in a wider range of what Torp et al. call 'everyday' settings. In this context, libraries have emerged as another potential setting whose ubiquity and accessibility suggests that they may be particularly effective in addressing health inequalities. Drawing on a case study-the Glasgow Macmillan Cancer Information and Support Services Library project-this paper reports on the potential for seeing 'libraries as settings' and in the context of a set of associated theoretical resources, specifically scrutinizes the nature of initiative implementation. Data were drawn from multiple sources: semi-structured interviews and focus groups with strategic partners and stakeholders, operational staff, project volunteers, service users and members of the general public. Qualitative data were complemented by quantitative insights from surveys with members of the partnership, libraries staff and volunteers. Despite some concerns associated with potentially hostile cultural and financial contexts that might threaten longer term sustainability, insights suggested that in pragmatic terms, the project was attracting sizable 'footfall' and successfully addressing a range of needs. Additionally, the formal implementation processes associated with project implementation were considered to have been highly successful in embedding the model into the library culture. In summary, there is evidence that libraries have the potential to be considered as supportive settings and could act as a model for an emergent vision of what libraries do.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; The Author 2016.

N2  - <ovid:b>IMPORTANCE</ovid:b>: Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) is an emerging technique to treat middle ear diseases; however, the interventions are performed in 2-dimensional (2D) endoscopic views, which do not provide depth perception. Recent technical developments now allow the application of 3-dimensional (3D) endoscopy in EES., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To investigate the usability, advantages, and disadvantages of 3D vs 2D endoscopy in EES under standardized conditions., <ovid:b>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS</ovid:b>: This cohort study conducted at a tertiary academic medical center in Bern, Switzerland, included 16 residents and consultants of the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Head & Neck Surgery, Inselspital, Bern., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Each participant performed selected steps of a type I tympanoplasty and stapedotomy in 3D and 2D views in a cadaveric model using a randomized, Latin-square crossover design., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</ovid:b>: Time taken to perform the EES, number of attempts, and accidental damage during the dissections were compared between 3D and 2D endoscopy. Eye tracking was performed throughout the interventions. Cognitive load and subjective feedback were measured by standardized questionnaires., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of the 16 surgeons included in the study (11 inexperienced residents; 5 experienced consultants), 8 were women (50%); mean age was 36 years (range, 27-57 years). Assessment of surgical time revealed similar operating times for both techniques (181 seconds in 2D vs 174 seconds in 3D). A total of 64 surgical interventions were performed. Most surgeons preferred the 3D technique (10 for 3D vs 6 for 2D), even though a higher incidence of eye strain, measured on a 7-point Likert scale, was observed (3D, 2.19 points vs 2D, 1.44 points; mean difference , 0.74; 95% CI, 0.29-1.20; r = 0.67). Eye movement assessment revealed a higher duration of fixation for consultants in 2D (0.79 seconds) compared with 3D endoscopy (0.54 seconds), indicating a less-efficient application of previously acquired experiences using the new technique. Residents (mean [SD], 49.02 [16.4]) had a significantly higher workload than consultants (mean [SD], 27.21 [12.20]), independent of the used technique or task., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE</ovid:b>: Three-dimensional endoscopy is suitable for EES, especially for inexperienced surgeons whose mental model of the intervention has yet to be consolidated. The application of 3D endoscopy in clinical routines and for educational purposes may be feasible and beneficial.

N2  - To evaluate the distribution of complications of chronic otitis media, dilemma of how soon to operate a seriously ill patient with CSOM and treatment outcomes. A retrospective study was done in a tertiary care centre. Clinical data from 2013 to 2015 was compiled, surgical management with outcome was analysed. A total of 425 patients with chronic otitis media were evaluated. Single/multiple complications were seen in 147 (34.5%) patients. Majority of the complications were seen in active squamosal type of chronic otitis media i.e. 137 (59.5%) cases out of the 147. Meningitis (3.3%) was the most common intracranial complication. Patients with intracranial complications were referred from other departments and did not primarily present to ENT, indicating a major fact that treatment was sort for the complication and not for chronic otitis media. Headache with or without ear discharge was the most common presenting complaint. Fever and pain were not prominent indicators of complications, posing a diagnostic dilemma as patients were already receiving antibiotics and analgesics before reaching tertiary care centre. The patients with severe intracranial complications were promptly taken up (within 3-5 days) for canal wall down mastoidectomy with intravenous broad spectrum antibiotic (vancomycin) and mannitol with high risk consent. However ill the patients were, especially children with very poor general conditions, there was dramatic recovery as soon as the mastoidectomy was done. There were no deaths due to the complications of chronic otitis media in our 3 years study period. Delay in resorting to surgical management of chronic otitis media was the main reason for patients going into complications. Timely mastoidectomy in patients with poor general condition with high risk of mortality, the surgery actually had a major role in reducing the morbidity and mortality. Lack of awareness that chronic otitis media is a condition that can lead to life threatening complications resulted in procrastination of surgery. Chronic otitis media requires speedy surgical management i.e. as soon as patient is fit to tolerate anaesthesia: Tympanoplasty and Canal wall up or down Mastoidectomy to prevent complications from arising or to resolve the present complication.

N2  - Difficulties are associated with reconstruction of middle ear bony structures in surgery for destructive lesions, including cholesteatoma. Although autologous cartilage appears to be the optimal choice because of its resistance to infection, the harvesting of sufficient volumes may be challenging. Therefore, regenerative medicine techniques to obtain sufficient material for reconstruction are awaited. We herein present a case of middle ear surgery for cholesteatoma with a sufficient volume of stick-shaped tissue-engineered cartilage produced from a piece of autologous auricular cartilage and autologous serum, with sufficient firmness to reconstruct bony structures. During surgery, sections of tissue-engineered cartilage were placed side by side to reconstruct the posterior canal wall. The postoperative course was uneventful. This is the first-in-human report of reconstructing middle ear bony structures with tissue-engineered cartilage. The results suggest a promising future for the satisfactory reconstruction of middle ear structures with minimal morbidity at the donor site.

All groups subsequently received 0.3 mg/kg etomidate by intravenous bolus injection over 15-20 s and were assessed for the severity of pain using Grade IV pain scale and observed for myoclonus for 2 min and graded according to clinical severity. Serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were obtained prior and postetomidate injection., <ovid:b>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</ovid:b>: Statistical analysis was performed by the SPSS program version 17.0 for Windows. Tests used are Shaipro-Wilk test, ANOVA, Tukey's multiple comparison test, Tamhane's T2, and the Chi-square test. For all statistical tests, <ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < 0.05 was considered statistically significant with 5% level of significance (alpha)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The incidence of myoclonus in Group 1 and 2 was 52.5% and 17.5%, respectively, whereas it was 92.45% in Group 3. There was no pain observed in 70%, 92.5%, and 50% of patients in Group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference in mean CPK level after induction among three groups (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i> < 0.001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Nalbuphine is more effective than fentanyl in the prevention of etomidate-induced myoclonus and pain with the minimum rise in CPK levels.

N2  - Polymers modified with bioactive nanoparticles are a promising solution for patients who need a tissue replacement. Modern implants, thanks to bioactive and bactericidal functions, facilitate the healing and regeneration process of the replaced tissue. The aim of this study was to assess whether silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) could support antibacterial function without cytotoxic effect and deterioration of biostability. This article describes biological and physiochemical aspects concerning a new polymeric middle ear implant (Otoimplant) enriched with silver nanoparticles. This kind of prosthesis is a promising implant for the reconstruction of ossicles in ossiculoplasty. We found that incorporation of silver nanoparticles into a polymeric matrix resulted in bactericidal efficacy against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, both resistant to antibiotics and basic strains. Our prostheses do not show cytotoxic effect and are a suitable biomaterial platform for effective culture of Saos2 and NHOst osteoblastic cells. The in vitro incubation of the samples in distilled water revealed that surface parameters, such as roughness, may slightly increase as a result of unveiling nanoparticles. However, the prolonged immersion does not change mechanical parameters. During one-year incubation, the prosthesis proved to retain stable values of Young's modulus, tensile strength, propagation of longitudinal ultrasonic waves, pH, and conductivity.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: There is limited evidence regarding the quality of otolaryngology residency programs in Iran. Regarding this, the present study aimed to assess some aspects of otolaryngology residency program in the field of otology in Iran based on the perspectives of faculty members and graduates., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: This study was conducted on 105 recent graduates and 30 faculty members and/or program directors in otolaryngology using two self-administered questionnaires., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: While the faculty members believed that a resident should work on at least 5.4 temporal bone surgeries on average, the actual number was 2.49. Tympanoplasty was assigned the highest rate of satisfaction by the recent graduates, whereas the lowest score belonged to middle ear exploration, ossiculoplasty, and stapes surgery. Only 53.6% of the graduates stated that there was an organized training curriculum in temporal laboratory. The recent graduates reported to have more frequent experiences of performing usual otology operations. However, they had fewer experiences of performing more advanced surgeries. The recently graduated subjects had a significantly low level of satisfaction with their competencies in carrying out more complex types of otology surgeries., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: High prevalence of otology surgeries in Iran provides valuable opportunities for training otolaryngology residents to achieve an acceptable level of competency. However, the results of this study strongly suggest the necessity of quality improvement both in teaching-learning and assessment processes in otolaryngology training programs.

N2  - The current study aimed to investigate the middle ear structure and surgical approach appropriate for middle ear surgery in rabbits. A total of eight healthy New Zealand rabbits (16 ears) were dissected under a surgical microscope. The dimensions of the auditory canal and the middle ear were measured. In the present study, the transcanal surgical approach to the middle ear in rabbits was performed without complications, the anatomical landmarks in the auricle and the external auditory canal were apparent, no large vessels were present in the surgical zone and the bleeding was minor. Furthermore, the surgical procedure did not require removal of large bone sections of the external auditory canal. Additionally, the constitution of the ossicular chain, the leverage ratio of the ossicular chain and the constitution of ligaments and muscles in rabbits were similar to humans. Otherwise, the facial nerve canal in rabbits was more prominent compared with humans and the mobility of pars flaccida in rabbits was more noticeable compared with humans. The results of the current study indicate that the transcanal surgical approach was suitable to study the middle ear in rabbits. Furthermore, the rabbit middle ear may be used as a model for ossicular surgery and facial nerve research.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted. A total of 123 otosclerosis subjects were included in the study. The subjects were divided in three groups based on the following interventions: (a) stapedotomy without any prior hearing-aid rehabilitation (n = 60); (b) hearing-aid rehabilitation without any prior stapedotomy (n = 33); and (c) stapedotomy with prior hearing-aid rehabilitation (n = 30). Pre- and post-operative pure tone audiometry were measured. The Swedish version of the GBI was completed by the subjects 6 months after the intervention. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency, factor analysis, construct validity, and criterion validity, was assessed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The Swedish version of the GBI was well accepted by the subjects. It showed good psychometric properties with an overall high reliability. Factor analysis resulted in a 5-factor solution explaining 66.6% of the variance where factors 1 and 2 represented the general health domain., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Overall, the Swedish version of the GBI showed good psychometric properties. Based on the factor analyses, there is the possibility that the general health domain should be divided in two separate domains: general health and psychosocial health., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 2c.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2019 The Authors.

N2  - <ovid:b>Introduction</ovid:b> Middle ear surgeries, including myringoplasty, have increasingly utilized endoscopes as an adjunct to or as a replacement for the operative microscope. <ovid:b>Objectives</ovid:b> The objective of the present study was to evaluate the graft uptake rate and to evaluate the hearing results. <ovid:b>Methods</ovid:b> This is a prospective study. We have analyzed 139 patients who underwent surgery for chronic otitis media (COM) of the mucosal type. All of the surgeries were performed exclusively under total endoscopic transcanal approach using tragal cartilage as graft, underlay technique. We have evaluated the postoperative graft uptake and performed a hearing evaluation at 6 weeks, at 12 weeks, and at 6 months. <ovid:b>Results</ovid:b> During the study period, 139 patients were included, out of which 13 were lost to follow-up; therefore, only 126 patients were assessed. All of the cases were performed under total endoscopic approach. As for the surgical outcome at the postoperative otoscopy, 3 cases had initial uptake at 3 months and failed later; therefore, complete closure of the perforation was observed in 97.6% ( <ovid:i>n</ovid:i> = 123) of the patients 6 months after the intervention. Four patients presented with preoperative anacusis; therefore, only 122 patients were included for hearing evaluation. The preoperative air conduction threshold (ACT) and airbone gap (ABG) were 43.34 +/- 11.53 and 24.73 +/- 7.89, respectively. Postoperatively, the ACT and ABG closure were 28.73 +/- 15.75 and 11.91 +/- 8.41, respectively. This difference was statistically significant ( <ovid:i>p</ovid:i> < 0.001). <ovid:b>Conclusion</ovid:b> The endoscopic approach for myringoplasty offers excellent visualization; avoids postaural approach, enables a faster recovery, requires less hospital stay, with excellent graft closure rate and improved functional outcomes.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Comparing the feasibility of ovine and synthetic temporal bones for simulating endoscopic ear surgery against the 'gold standard' of human cadaveric tissue., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A total of 10 candidates (5 trainees and 5 experts) performed endoscopic tympanoplasty on 3 models: Pettigrew temporal bones, ovine temporal bones and cadaveric temporal bones. Candidates completed a questionnaire assessing the face validity, global content validity and task-specific content validity of each model., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Regarding ovine temporal bone validity, the median values were 4 (interquartile range = 4-4) for face validity, 4 (interquartile range = 4-4) for global content validity and 4 (interquartile range = 4-4) for task-specific content validity. For the Pettigrew temporal bone, the median values were 3.5 (interquartile range = 2.25-4) for face validity, 3 (interquartile range = 2.75-3) for global content validity and 3 (interquartile range = 2.5-3) for task-specific content validity. The ovine temporal bone was considered significantly superior to the Pettigrew temporal bone for the majority of validity categories assessed., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Tympanoplasty is feasible in both the ovine temporal bone and the Pettigrew temporal bone. However, the ovine model was a significantly more realistic simulation tool.

The survey was sent to this cohort in the winter of 2017-2018., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Three hundred and three residents responded, with 293 completing the survey. Twenty-three percent were PGY1, 19% PGY2, 21% PGY3, 18% PGY4, and 19% PGY5 or higher. The majority of residents progress from resident assistant as a PGY2, to resident surgeon as a PGY3 and self-assessed competent surgeon as a PGY4 for the majority of the key indicator cases. Less than 50% of the surveyed PGY5 residents had reached independent practice in all the key indicator cases, with stapedectomy (16%), rhinoplasty (18%), and paramedian forehead flap (14.5%) being the cases least frequently performed independently. Ninety-five percent of the respondent residents felt their program provided adequate training, but 20% of the respondents were either unsure or believed that they would be unable to perform all the key indicator cases by the completion of their training., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The majority of otolaryngology residents feel confident in their training, but experience with certain cases lags behind and may not currently be taught as resident level cases. These findings raise the question of whether the current key indicator cases are the best option for assessing breadth and depth of residency training., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: NA.

N2  - <ovid:b>Objective:</ovid:b> To analyze the failure reasons of the typeItympanoplasty and to summarize the successful experiences of the reoperation. <ovid:b>Method:</ovid:b> A retrospective clinical study of 42 patients undergoing second type Itympanoplasty in the ENT department of Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital from 2007 to 2017 was performed. By reviewing the perioperative clinical data and by following up the patients for 3 months to summarize the failure reasons of the first tympanoplasty and successful experiences of the second tympanoplasty. <ovid:b>Result:</ovid:b> All of the 42 patients received second tympanoplasty under general anesthesia using the post auricular approach, harvesting the temporalis fascia as the graft material, enlarging the external canal to optimize of the operation vision and using underlay tympanoplasty technique. During the operation calcification was found in 12 cases, tympanosclerosis in 6 cases, handle of malleus attached to promontorium tympani in 7 cases, and remnant tympanic membrane adhered to promontorium tympani in 10 cases. Three months after the second tympanoplasty all of the perforations were closed. The air-bone gap(ABG) between 0.5-4.0 kHz before and after the second tympanoplasty were(26.4+/-8.7) dB HL and(14.0+/-7.3) dB HL, respectively. The difference is statistically significant(<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>=0.000). ABG less than 20 dB HL was found in 35 cases (83.3%) after the second tympanoplasty. <ovid:b>Conclusion: </ovid:b> Type Itympanoplasty is a delicate operation. Poor surgical outcomes of the first operation were due to inadequate exposure, mucosal lesion of the promontory, and inadequate gelatin sponge filling in the middle cavity. Post auricular approach, enlarged and straight external canal could optimize the operation vision, resolve the adhesion of the tympanum easily and acquire the adequate anterior overlap, which are benefit for success closure of the perforation and better hearing after surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright&#xa9; by the Editorial Department of Journal of Clinical Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Facial nerve aberration is the most troublesome situation in congenital malformations of middle ear. The aim of our study is to investigate its imaging and clinical features as well as relevant choice of surgical techniques for hearing improvement., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A retrospective study involving review of clinical data of 227 patients (256 ears) with congenital middle ear anomaly was undertaken, including preoperative computed tomography (CT) data, surgical records and videos., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Aberration involving intratemporal facial nerve was found in 82/256 ears (32.03%) with congenital middle ear anomaly. The most common forms of aberration included overhanging over the oval window (50/82 ears, 60.98%), bifurcation (3/82 ears, 3.66%) and transverse over the promontory (3/82 ears, 3.66%), counting for 68.29% (56/82) of the cases with facial nerve aberration. Concomitant stapes malformation was found in 76/82 ears (92.68%) and atresia or stenosis of the oval window in 27/82 ears (32.93%). In 9/82 ears (10.98%) both stapes and oval window was absent. Elective surgeries for the purpose of hearing improvement included stapodotomy + piston implantation, labyrinthotomy, labyrinthotomy + total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) implantation and Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) implantation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The majority of facial nerve aberration in congenital malformation of middle ear involves displacement of facial nerve, in addition to concomitant malformations of the stapes and/or oval window, which may influence the choice of surgery for hearing improvement. VSB implantation may be considered as a useful option.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to investigate functional results of total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) shaft stabilization with a cartilage shoe in chronic otitis media patients with cholesteatoma who had undergone canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy (CWDT). In addition, it was determined whether the presence of granular and edematous mucosa in middle ear altered functional outcomes., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Sixty patients, who had undergone CWDT with the use of TORP for the reconstruction of ossicular chain, were divided into two groups. Patients with cartilage shoe were classified as Group 1 (n=30) and those without the shoe were classified as Group 2 (n=30). Patients in both groups were classified into "A" and "B" subgroups according to the middle ear risk index (MERI). Air conduction (AC) and bone conduction thresholds were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There was no statistically significant change between preoperative AC thresholds of the groups and subgroups (p>0.05). There were statistically significant differences regarding AC thresholds and air-bone gap (ABG) values between Groups 1 and 2 at the postoperative 12th month (p<0.05). Postoperative AC thresholds and ABG values of Group 1B patients with a high MERI score were statistically significant at all frequencies than those of Group 2B patients (p<0.05). When ABG values were compared, it was observed that functional results were better in Group 1B, but a statistically significant difference was observed only at 2000 Hz (p<0.01)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The cartilage shoe method for titanium TORP stabilization that is used for ossicular reconstruction during CWDT has been found to have a beneficial effect on auditory outcomes. Cartilage shoe application increases positive effects on hearing outcomes, particularly if the middle ear mucosa is granular and edematous.

N2  - To study functional outcome of the endoscopic management of limited attico-antral cholesteatoma in terms of visualization of sac, cholesteatoma disease clearance, ABG closure improvement, preservation of residual anatomy and recurrence of disease. It is a prospective study done during Feb 2016 to March 2017 done on 20 pts with limited attico-antral cholesteatoma with CT confirmation. Endoscopic management of limited attico-antral cholesteatoma with complete removal of sac, infected discharge and granulations along with creation of MRMC Neo surgical ventilating port (joining Anterior & posterior isthmuses) done in cases where residual attic anatomy was present to establish physiological attic ventilation and drainage. Whereas in cases of attic and ossicular erosion, ossiculoplasty along with neo attic malleo-incudal complex (with composite tragal cartilage with perichondrium graft) for lateral attic wall reconstruction was done to prevent attic retraction. Patients had mean pre op ABG of 36.29 +/- 6.29 and mean post op ABG closure of 16.33 +/- 6.50 with no recurrence of cholesteatoma at 6 months of follow up. Patient showed significant (55%) improvement in hearing with all having graft uptake in which four cases having mild pars tensa retraction which recovered later without any intervention. Thus creation of new MRMC Neo surgical ventilating port or neo attic malleo-incudal complex with endoscopic approach allows better visual access to clear the limited attico-antral disease with sparing of normal residual attic anatomy along with physiological ventilation and drainage having better hearing results and outcome.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To examine the current trend in intraoperative facial nerve monitoring (IOFNM) training, performance, and reimbursement by subspecialists., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Cross-sectional survey of the American Neurotology Society, American Otological Society, American Society of Pediatric Otolaryngology, and program directors of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery programs accredited by the Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Intraoperative Nerve Monitoring Task Force., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The task force developed 2 surveys, which were implemented through Surveymonkey.com: (1) a 10-question survey sent to 1506 members of the societies listed to determine IOFNM practice and reimbursement patterns and (2) a 10-question survey sent to the 107 accredited US otolaryngology residency program directors to examine the state of resident training on facial nerve monitoring., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Response rates were 18% for practicing physicians and 15% for residency program directors. The majority agreed that IOFNM was indicated for most otologic and neurotologic procedures. In addition to facial nerve monitoring, facial nerve stimulation was used in complex skull base and temporal bone procedures. When queried about reimbursement by Medicare, only 4.4% of surgeons responded that they received reimbursement. Program directors indicated universal exposure of residents to IOFNM, with 61% of programs giving residents formal training., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: IOFNM is widely used among otologists and neurotologists in the United States. The majority of residents receive formal training, and all residents are exposed to the setup, use, monitoring, and troubleshooting of the device. Reimbursement for IOFNM is reported by a paucity of those surveyed.

N2  - Single-atom catalysts with full utilization of metal centers can bridge the gap between molecular and solid-state catalysis. Metal-nitrogen-carbon materials prepared via pyrolysis are promising single-atom catalysts but often also comprise metallic particles. Here, we pyrolytically synthesize a Co-N-C material only comprising atomically dispersed cobalt ions and identify with X-ray absorption spectroscopy, magnetic susceptibility measurements and density functional theory the structure and electronic state of three porphyrinic moieties, CoN<ovid:sub>4</ovid:sub>C<ovid:sub>12</ovid:sub>, CoN<ovid:sub>3</ovid:sub>C<ovid:sub>10,porp</ovid:sub> and CoN<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub>C<ovid:sub>5</ovid:sub>. The O<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> electro-reduction and operando X-ray absorption response are measured in acidic medium on Co-N-C and compared to those of a Fe-N-C catalyst prepared similarly. We show that cobalt moieties are unmodified from 0.0 to 1.0 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode, while Fe-based moieties experience structural and electronic-state changes. On the basis of density functional theory analysis and established relationships between redox potential and O<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub>-adsorption strength, we conclude that cobalt-based moieties bind O<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> too weakly for efficient O<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> reduction.Nitrogen-doped carbon materials with atomically dispersed iron or cobalt are promising for catalytic use. Here, the authors show that cobalt moieties have a higher redox potential, bind oxygen more weakly and are less active toward oxygen reduction than their iron counterpart, despite similar coordination.

N2  - The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of facial canal dehiscence (FCD) in primary and revision cholesteatoma surgery in a tertiary referral center. Moreover, our second goal was to identify association between FCD and other intra-operative pathological findings in a group of patients with cholesteatoma surgery. Inclusion criteria were primary and revision canal wall up and canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy in patients who suffers from chronic otitis media (COM) with cholesteatoma. An exclusion criterion was charts with in adequate documentation. In addition tympanoplasty cases were excluded due to evaluate both tympanic and mastoid segments of facial nerve canal. Preoperative clinical data and intra-operative findings were documented in a formatted questionnaire. We found the incidence of FCD in COM surgery was 18%. There was no difference between the primary and revision surgeries regarding its incidence. In addition, there was association between some preoperative or intra-operative findings of COM, such as middle fossa dural dehiscence, external auditory canal polyp, facial nerve paralysis, labyrinthine fistula, and FCD. In conclusions we found that there was no difference between primary and revision surgeries regarding the incidence of FCD. Surgeons should consider effective measures to prevent intra-operative facial nerve trauma in COM surgeries.

N2  - Aim of the present study is to evaluate the long term results of ossiculoplasty using titanium clip prosthesis. A retrospective analysis with prospective follow-up has been done including for all patients who had a Clip-PORP implanted between the years 2002-2013. Following this, audiometric hearing results were measured with clinical examination including otoscopy and quality of life evaluation using Glasgow benefit inventory. 48 patients (51 ears, 29 men, 19 women, average age 44.1 years) received followed up after an average duration of 6.3 years. The overall air-bone-gap (0.5-4 kHz) decreased from 22.8 dB preoperatively to 14.6 dB postoperatively (p<=0.001). The most frequent indication for surgical treatment were cholesteatomas and recurrent cholesteatomas (52%), chronic inflammation of middle ear (12%), revision of radical mastoidectomy (8%) and disturbance in sound conduction after previous operation (14%). Tympanic membrane was closed in 47 times (92,2%), 4 times (7,8%) there was a defect. Clip-PORP was in situ 39 times (75%), protrusion and disposal were detected 6 times (11,8%) and 2 times (4%), respectively. However, 1 time (2%) the prothesis was lost or evaluation was not possible (3 times, 5,9%). The overall patient satisfaction and general subscale score after the treatment was beneficially evaluated. There was no change in social support score nore the physical health score. In summary, the ossicular chain reconstruction using titan Clip-PORP is safe and well established. Also in long-term analysis stable hearing results due to reduction of air bone gap are represented. The subjective quality of life is sustainable improved.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: To demonstrate surgical techniques and to compare the anatomical and functional outcomes between temporalis fascia and cartilage palisade grafting in type-I underlay tympanoplasty in patients with large/subtotal perforation., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Temporalis fascia and cartilage palisade grafting were conducted in Group A and Group B, respectively, each containing 30 patients with large/subtotal perforations. Pure tone audiogram (PTA) and speech reception thresholds (SRT) were performed preoperatively and at each postoperative visit; i.e. at the end of Month 1,3,6, and 24. A 10-dB closure of air bone gap (ABG) and a 10-dB improvement in SRT were considered significant., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The graft uptake rates were 80% and 96.7% in Group A and Group B, respectively, at the end of 24 months. In total, 90% of Group A and 88% in Group B had significant improvement in hearing (ABG >=10 dB). The mean improvement in SRT in the fascia and cartilage groups was 10 dB and 9 dB, respectively. Seventy-five percent of patients in Group A and 60% of patients in Group B had a significant gain in SRT., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Although both temporalis fascia and cartilage palisades can effectively be used for tympanic membrane (TM) grafting in difficult perforations, the latter is considered to be the better autograft, not only because of superior graft uptake but also because it results in a comparable hearing outcome.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This study aimed to compare the outcome of endoscopic and microscopic tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This was a retrospective comparative study of 73 patients (35 males and 38 females) who underwent type I tympanoplasty at Samsung Medical Center from April to December 2014. The subjects were classified into two groups; endoscopic tympanoplasty (ET, n=25), microscopic tympanoplasty (MT, n=48). Demographic data, perforation size of tympanic membrane at preoperative state, pure tone audiometric results preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively, operation time, sequential postoperative pain scale (NRS-11), and graft success rate were evaluated., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The perforation size of the tympanic membrane in ET and MT group was 25.3%+/-11.7% and 20.1%+/-11.9%, respectively (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>=0.074). Mean operation time of MT (88.9+/-28.5 minutes) was longer than that of the ET (68.2+/-22.1 minutes) with a statistical significance (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>=0.002). External auditory canal (EAC) width was shorter in the ET group than in the MT group (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>=0.011). However, EAC widening was not necessary in the ET group and was performed in 33.3% of patients in the MT group. Graft success rate in the ET and MT group were 100% and 95.8%, respectively; the values were not significantly different (<ovid:i>P</ovid:i>=0.304). Pre- and postoperative audiometric results including bone and air conduction thresholds and air-bone gap were not significantly different between the groups. In all groups, the postoperative air-bone gap was significantly improved compared to the preoperative air-bone gap. Immediate postoperative pain was similar between the groups. However, pain of 1 day after surgery was significantly less in the ET group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: With endoscopic system, minimal invasive tympanoplasty can be possible with similar graft success rate and less pain.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: We reviewed functional outcomes of tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: The results of tympanoplastic surgery are changing in time. We present late treatment outcomes among different types of tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Eighty-six patients who underwent tympanoplasty were enrolled in the study. The results of pure tone audiometry performed 7 days before, then at 3 months, 1 year, and 3 years after the surgery were assessed. Type II tympanoplasty involved implantation of a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis and type III tympanoplasty involved reconstruction with a total ossicular replacement prosthesis and the use of autogenous homogenous material. Statistical analysis was performed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: With all four types of tympanoplasty, hearing improvement was achieved at 3 months and 1 year after surgery based on the magnitude of the mean ABG reduction (p<0.001). In patients who underwent type I, type III, and type IV tympanoplasty, the ABG reduction at 3 years after surgery was maintained at the level reported at 3 months and 1 year after surgery (p<0.001). In patients who underwent type II tympanoplasty, however, the mean ABG value was increased at all tested frequencies (p<0.05). The mean ABG values reported 3 years after type II and type III tympanoplasty were similar., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Based on the results over time, hearing improvement seems to be less durable after reconstruction with the partial ossicular replacement prosthesis procedure compared to the total ossicular replacement prosthesis procedure.

N2  - The objective of the study was to improve the functional outcomes of the treatment in the patients presenting with chronic otitis media by means of the combined application of platelet-enriched plasma and the biologically compatible cyanacrylate-based glue for the fixation of the reconstructed auditory ossicular chain. The functional results of the surgery were evaluated within 1, 3, and12 months after the intervention making use of tonal threshold audiometry. It was shown that the use of the platelet-enriched plasma with its subsequent fixation by the biologically compatible cyanacrylate-based glue enhances stability of the implanted prosthetic elements, reduces the risk of their displacement during the postoperative period due to the formation of the cicatrical tissue between the structural components of the middle ear. This approach improves the functional result of the described treatment and decreases the frequency of relapses associated with poor stability of the reconstructed sound-conducting system.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: It is an ongoing debate whether tympanoplasty should be performed in the pediatric age group. The purpose of this study was to analyze and compare the anatomical and functional outcomes of type I cartilage tympanoplasty in children and adults., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The file records of patients who underwent type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty were retrospectively reviewed. In total, 133 patients who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media were included. Tragal cartilage grafts were used in all patients. The patients were divided into two groups: pediatric (age<=16 years, n=54) and adult (age>18 years, n=79) groups. The graft success rates and hearing results between the two groups were compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The graft success rate was 90.2% (120/133) in the study group. At the end of the 24-month follow-up, the graft was intact in 48 of the 54 (88.9%) patients in the pediatric group and 72 of the 79 patients in the adult group (91.1%) (p=0.769). The functional success rate (postoperative air-bone gap<20 dB) obtained in the study group was 90.2% (120/133). The functional success rate was 88.9% (48/54) in the pediatric group and 91.1% (72/79) in the adult group (p=0.255)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The graft success rates and hearing results obtained with cartilage grafts are similar in children and adults. Therefore, cartilage grafts may be safely used in pediatric patients, similar to their use in adults.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Chronic suppurative otitis media is a neglected condition affecting up to 330 million people worldwide, with the burden of the disease in impoverished countries. The need for non-governmental organisations to hardwire training into their programmes has been highlighted. An ear surgery simulator appropriate for training in resource-poor settings was developed, and its effectiveness in facilitating the acquisition of headlight and microsurgical skills necessary to safely perform procedures via the ear canal was investigated., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Face validity was assessed via questionnaires. Six tasks were developed: a headlight foreign body removal task, and microscope tasks of foreign body removal, ventilation tube insertion, tympanomeatal flap raising, myringoplasty and middle-ear manipulation. Participants with varying ENT experience were video-recorded performing each task and scored by a blinded expert observer to assess construct validity., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Face validity results confirmed that our Ear Trainer was a realistic representation of the ear. Construct validity results showed a statistically significant trend, with experts performing the best and those with limited experience performing better than novices., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study validates our Ear Trainer as a useful training tool for assessing headlight and microsurgical skills required to perform otological procedures.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: In Internet forums and other social media many reports regarding chronic headaches after cochlear implantation can be found. Although quite rare, there are also some reports in the literature. However, little is known regarding the true prevalence of headaches in persons who have undergone cochlear implant surgery., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the 1-year prevalence of headache in patients having received a cochlear implantation ("cochlear implant group") in comparison with patients having undergone middle ear surgery ("surgery group") and persons with no history of head and neck surgery ("non-ear-nose-throat [ENT] group")., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Cross-sectional, monocentric study using a validated headache questionnaire., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Three hundred persons were asked to participate. Two hundred thirty four valid questionnaires were returned. The participants' median age was 62 years, of whom 45% were women. The prevalence of headache was 31% (95%-confidence interval [CI]: [21; 42]) in the cochlear implant group and 46% (95%-CI: [35; 57]) in the surgery group with no significant difference between these two subgroups (p = 0.071). In the non-ENT group the prevalence of headache was significantly higher than in the other two subgroups (64%, 95%-CI: [52; 74])., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION</ovid:b>: The prevalence of headache is not higher in cochlear implant patients in comparison to middle ear surgery patients, other, non-ENT patients and the general German or European population., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Cochlear implantation does not seem to be associated with an increased risk for developing headache.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: Prosthesis' length creates tension in ossicular reconstructions, which directly effects the middle ear sound transmission., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Relatively long prostheses are often used to stabilize the middle ear reconstruction to prevent dislocation. Thereby, tension on the flexible components such as the tympanic membrane (TM) and the annular ligament (AL) is increased. Only little is known on the amount of displacement-related stiffening of the TM and AL, as well as the consecutive reduction in middle ear transfer function (METF)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: An expandable total ossicular replacement prosthesis was tensionfree inserted in nine cadaveric temporal bones between the malleus handle and the stapes footplate. Upon heat activation the prosthesis was lengthened, thus inducing tension on the reconstruction. The METF was assessed before and after elongation. TM's and AL's stiffness were determined by measuring their force-displacement characteristics., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Upon activation the prostheses were elongated between 50 and 200 mum. A frequency-dependent METF reduction was measured with a decrease of 5 to 25 dB below 1.0 kHz. At frequencies >2.0 kHz the reduction was less prominent or the METF showed even an improvement of up to 10 dB. TM's stiffness remained constant during the elongation-induced displacement, whereas the AL's stiffness increased. The METF reduction below 1.0 kHz correlated with the increasing AL's stiffness., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Tension has a significant impact on the METF after middle ear reconstruction. As little tension as possible should be used to enable best sound transmission. Stabilization of prosthesis should be achieved with dislocation devices to ensure secure coupling to the ossicular remnants without creating additional tension.

T1  - The PorX Response Regulator of the Porphyromonas gingivalis PorXY Two-Component System Does Not Directly Regulate the Type IX Secretion Genes but Binds the PorL Subunit.

N2  - The Type IX secretion system (T9SS) is a versatile multi-protein complex restricted to bacteria of the Bacteriodetes phylum and responsible for the secretion or cell surface exposition of diverse proteins that participate to S-layer formation, gliding motility or pathogenesis. The T9SS is poorly characterized but a number of proteins involved in the assembly of the secretion apparatus in the oral pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis have been identified based on genome substractive analyses. Among these proteins, PorY, and PorX encode typical two-component system (TCS) sensor and CheY-like response regulator respectively. Although the porX and porY genes do not localize at the same genetic locus, it has been proposed that PorXY form a bona fide TCS. Deletion of porX in P. gingivalis causes a slight decrease of the expression of a number of other T9SS genes, including sov, porT, porP, porK, porL, porM, porN, and porY. Here, we show that PorX and the soluble cytoplasmic domain of PorY interact. Using electrophoretic mobility shift, DNA-protein co-purification and heterologous host expression assays, we demonstrate that PorX does not bind T9SS gene promoters and does not directly regulate expression of the T9SS genes. Finally, we show that PorX interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of PorL, a component of the T9SS membrane core complex and propose that the CheY-like PorX protein might be involved in the dynamics of the T9SS.

Postoperatively, the PTA-ABG was successfully closed to <=20 dB in 39.5% (17/43) of patients. The average final PTA-ABG (obtained at least 5 years after surgery) was 25.3 dB, which was also a significant improvement over the preoperative baseline PTA-ABG (p <<< 0.01). Significant complications were observed in 14.0% (6/43) of patients, with 9.3% (4/43) requiring a subsequent surgery. Although 69.8% (30/43) of patients experienced otorrhea preoperatively, otorrhea was only observed in 4.7% (2/43) at any point in time postoperatively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Secondary mastoid obliteration with reconstruction of a more natural posterior canal wall, cartilage tympanoplasty, and ossicular chain reconstruction is a hybrid technique that allows for creation of a safe, dry ear with significant, long-term improvement in hearing and functional outcomes in patients with unstable mastoid cavities.

N2  - Severe to profound mixed hearing loss is associated with hearing rehabilitation difficulties. Recently, promising results for speech understanding were obtained with a direct acoustic cochlear implant (DACI). The surgical implantation of a DACI with standard coupling through a stapedotomy can however be regarded as challenging. Therefore, in this experimental study, the feasibility of direct acoustic stimulation was investigated at an anatomically and surgically more accessible inner ear site. DACI stimulation of the intact, blue-lined and opened lateral semicircular canal (LC) was investigated and compared with standard oval window (OW) coupling. Additionally, stapes footplate fixation was induced. Round window (RW) velocity, as a measure of the performance of the device and its coupling efficiency, was determined in fresh-frozen human cadaver heads. Using single point laser Doppler vibrometry, RW velocity could reliably be measured in low and middle frequency range, and equivalent sound pressure level (LE) output was calculated. Results for the different conditions obtained in five heads were analyzed in subsequent frequency ranges. Comparing the difference in RW membrane velocity showed higher LE in the LC opened condition [mean: 103 equivalent dB SPL], than in LC intact or blue-lined conditions [63 and 74 equivalent dB SPL, respectively]. No difference was observed between the LC opened and the standard OW condition. Inducing stapes fixation, however, led to a difference in the low frequency range of LE compared to LC opened. In conclusion, this feasibility study showed promising results for direct acoustic stimulation at this specific anatomically and surgically more accessible inner ear site. Future studies are needed to address the impact of LC stimulation on cochlear micromechanics and on the vestibular system like dizziness and risks of hearing loss.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The use of Serious exerGames (SeG) as enriched environments (EE), which promotes cognitive simulation with physical activity in a positive emotional context, has been proposed to represent a powerful method to slow down the decline due to neurodegenerative diseases (ND), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, so far, no SeG targeting EE has been tested in ND subjects., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study aimed at evaluating the usability and short-term training effects of X-Torp, an action SeG designed for elderly ND subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: X-Torp is a SeG played using the Microsoft R Kinect TM. 10 ND subjects and 8 healthy elderly controls (HEC) were enrolled in a 1-month program with three training sessions per week. Usability was evaluated through game time, game performance, the aerobic intensity level reached, perceived emotions, and perceived usability., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All participants successfully completed the training program. ND subjects played less and had a lower game performance compared to HEC. During the sessions, ND subjects maintained a light intensity of aerobic activity, while HEC maintained a moderate intensity. Both groups experienced only positive emotions, and reported a 'moderate' to 'high' perceived competence, a 'moderate' game difficulty, and a 'high' interest in the game., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Usability results suggest that X-Torp represents a usable EE for healthy subjects and persons with MCI and AD. However, in order to reach moderate or high intensity of aerobic activity, X-Torp control modes should be adapted to become more physically stimulating.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: This study reviews the cases of stapedotomy and evaluates its effectiveness at improving hearing loss in patients with otosclerosis., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Retrospective review of patients' records who had clinical and audiometric diagnosis of otosclerosis from January to December 2012., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 54 stapedotomy surgeries (52 unilateral and 1 bilateral surgeries) were received. Average post-operative ABG for 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 KHz showed that 61.1% had complete closure of ABG ( ABG < 10 dB) compared with 1.6% preoperatively and 85.2% had closure of ABG to within 20dB compared with 4.7% preoperatively (t - 13.89, p = 0.000). More than 94% had hearing improvement and 81.5% had ABG closure greater than 10 dB postoperatively (mean gain 23.38 +/- 12.37, t = 13.89, p = 0.000). A total of 13% complications were recorded with TM perforation (5.6%) being the commonest complication., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Stapedotomy is an effective surgical procedure for the treatment of otosclerosis which leads to improvement in patients' quality of life. A favorable hearing outcome can be obtained by the combination of experienced hands with minimal surgical trauma and appropriate surgical technique.

N2  - Over the last 20 years, the number of stapes operations performed has decreased steadily. This inadequate exposure to stapes surgery poses problems for both trainees and trainers. We retrospectively reviewed the outcomes of stapedotomy performed by a young physician at the ENT Clinic of the "A. Gemelli" Hospital of Rome. We used the technique of "one-shot" CO2 Laser stapedotomy using a titanium-Teflon piston. For data analysis, we considered the audiograms obtained 24 hours preoperatively and at the last follow-up examination (mean 45 months). Air conduction (AC) and bone conduction (BC) PTA were calculated for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz thresholds. Air bone gap (ABG) were obtained from ACPTA and BCPTA. Postoperative hearing gain was calculated from the ABG before the operation minus the ABG at late follow-up examination. Analysis of outcomes did not show a clear endpoint for the learning curve; complete closure of the ABG was obtained in a large number of patients at the beginning followed by patients who showed a higher ABG. Fortunately, we did not observed any "dead ear". The study supports a learning curve in stapes surgery, but the results can vary widely among surgeries with excellent results followed by others that are not fully satisfactory. Stapes surgery should not be one of the first ear surgeries performed by a young otologist due to the functional outcome expected by patients and the lack of necessary surgical skills.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> &#xa9; Copyright by Societa Italiana di Otorinolaringologia e Chirurgia Cervico-Facciale, Rome, Italy.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Various graft materials have been used to close tympanic membrane perforations. In the literature, there are few studies in pediatric populations comparing different graft materials. To our knowledge, there is no reported study that measured the thickness of the tragal cartilage in pediatric tympanoplasties. The tragal cartilage is not of uniform thickness in every patient., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare anatomical and functional outcomes of temporalis fascia muscle and full-thickness tragal cartilage in type 1 pediatric tympanoplasties., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In total, 78 patients (38 males, 40 females; average age 10.02+/-1.98 years; range, 7-18 years) who underwent type 1 tympanoplasties in our clinic were included. Demographics, anatomical, and functional outcomes were collected. Temporalis fascia muscle and tragal cartilage were used as graft materials. Tragal cartilage was used without thinning, and the thickness of tragal cartilage was measured using a micrometer. Anatomical and functional outcomes of cartilage and fascia were compared. Audiometric results comparing the cartilage and fascia groups were conducted at 6 months, and we continued to follow the patients to 1 year after surgery. An intact graft and an air-bone gap<=20dB were regarded as a surgical success. Results with a p-value<0.05 were considered statistically significant., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The graft success rate was 92.1% for the cartilage group compared with 65.0% for the temporal fascia group. In the fascia group, the preoperative air-bone gap was 33.68+/-11.44 dB and postoperative air-bone gap was 24.25+/-12.68dB. In the cartilage group, the preoperative air-bone gap was 35.68+/-12.94dB and postoperative air-bone gap was 26.11+/-12.87dB. The anatomical success rate in the cartilage group was significantly better than that for the fascia group (p<0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in functional outcomes between the fascia and cartilage groups (p>0.05). The average thickness of tragal cartilage in the pediatric population was 0.693+/-0.094mm in males and 0.687+/-0.058 mm in females., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Our data suggest that the anatomical success rate for a cartilage tympanoplasty was higher than for a fascia tympanoplasty. Functional results with cartilage were not different than with fascia, even though we did not thin the tragal cartilage. However, further studies should focus on the interaction between the thickness of the tragal cartilage and the tympanoplasty success rate.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2016 Associacao Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia Cervico-Facial.

N2  - The use of "one-shot" CO<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> laser technique for a primary small-fenestra stapedotomy is well established, but few papers report the long-term functional results. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 198 patients, treated for otosclerosis from January 2008 to December 2011, at the Department of Head and Neck Surgery, Catholic University of Rome. Statistical comparison between audiological thresholds obtained 24 h preoperatively, at early (4 weeks) and late postoperative examinations (mean time 45 months), was performed. Comparison of preoperative vs both early and late postoperative ACPTA showed a statistically significant difference (respectively 55 vs 33 and 31 dB; p < 0.001). No statistical difference was observed between preoperative, early and late postoperative BCPTA (respectively 23 vs 23 and 22 dB; p > 0.05). Both early and late postoperative ABG improved significantly compared to the preoperative one (respectively 10 and 9 vs 32 dB; p < 0.001). No statistical difference was found in comparison of early vs late postoperative ACPTA (respectively 33 vs 31 dB; p > 0.05), early vs late postoperative ABG (respectively 10 vs 9 dB; p > 0.05) and early vs late ABG gain (respectively 22 vs 23 dB; p > 0.05). No subjects developed postoperative complications requiring revision surgery or late deterioration of hearing threshold. The analysis of our data suggests that "one-shot" CO<ovid:sub>2</ovid:sub> laser stapedotomy is an effective and safe procedure: it allows a rapid stapedotomy without damages for the inner ear and optimal functional results that remain stable during the years.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Eustachian tube dysfunction is considered a major contributor to chronic middle ear disease. In clinical case series, the results of balloon dilation (balloon Eustachian tuboplasty, BET) as a treatment for Eustachian tube dysfunction have been reported., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study aims to analyze whether patients undergoing planned surgery for chronic middle ear disease would benefit from additional BET., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In a randomized controlled, patient and observer (not surgeon)-blind clinical study, 100 adult patients with planned surgery for chronic middle ear disease will be investigated. Patients will be randomized into two groups, one of which (50%) will receive additional BET of the affected side during the planned surgery. Eustachian tube function will be evaluated using the Valsalva maneuver and tubomanometry according to Esteve, as well as on the basis of patient reports. Various scores will be used as outcome measures, including ETS-5 (Eustachian Tube Score 5), the extended version ETS-7, and the ETDQ-7 (Seven-Item Eustachian Tube Dysfunction Questionnaire). Follow-up is at 3, 6, and 12 months., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: From June to December 2015, 162 patients underwent microscopic ear surgery. Inclusion criteria were not fulfilled by 90 patients. Of the remaining 72 patients with chronic middle ear disease, 12 patients (17%) have been randomized so far, 28 (39%) did not exhibit Eustachian tube dysfunction, and 32 (44%) patients could not be included for other reasons., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The rate of recruitment was lower than expected. Depending on the case number calculations for the patient groups identified in the study for whom BET might be particularly beneficial, multicenter studies in specific disease groups may follow.

N2  - Conclusions This technique is offered as a convenient and reliable method for cases with anterior TM perforation and inadequate anterior remnant. <ovid:br/>Objectives Chronic otitis media surgery is one of the most common procedures in otology. Anterior tympanic membrane (TM) perforation with inadequate anterior remnant is associated with higher rates of graft failure. It was the goal of this series to evaluate the anatomical and functional outcomes of a modified underlay myringoplasty technique-the anterior pull-through method. Materials and methods In a retrospective clinical study, 13 patients with anterior TM perforations with inadequate anterior remnants underwent tympanoplasty with anterior pull-through technique. The anterior tip of the temporalis fascia was pulled through and secured in a short incision lateral to the anterior part of the annulus. Data on graft take rate, pre-operative, and post-operative hearing status were analyzed. Results A graft success rate of 84.6% (11 out of 13) was achieved, without lateralization, blunting, atelectasia, or epithelial pearls. The air-bone gap was 21.5 +/- 6.8 dB before intervention and 11.75 +/- 5.7 dB after surgery (p = 0.003).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To investigate the effectiveness of scaffold-embedded mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) as a topical treatment for healing tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs) in a mouse model., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective animal study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Experimental., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: In vitro: under sterile conditions, porcine-derived (Gelita-Spon [GS]), hyaluronate-derived (EpiDisc [ED]), and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) scaffolds were cut into small pieces and cocultured with murine bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs) expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) for 72 hours. The cultures were either analyzed by confocal microscopy or used for subsequent in vivo experiments. In vivo: 26 mice were divided into 3 groups (ie, control [n = 9], GS [n = 8], ED [n = 9]). Under general anesthesia, TMPs of equal sizes were performed bilaterally using a sterile 27-gauge needle under a surgical microscope. The BM-MSCs embedded within GS or ED scaffolds were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline and then topically applied on right TMPs, and scaffolds alone were applied on left TMPs 6 to 8 hours after injury. Control mice did not receive treatment. On day 7, animals were euthanized and bullae were harvested for histological analysis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In vitro: BM-MSCs grew well on both GS (P = .0012) and ED (P = .0001) scaffolds compared with PVA. In vivo: 100% of untreated (control) TMPs remained open after 7 days. Animals treated with MSC-embedded ED scaffolds had a higher percentage of TMP closure (P = .016) and a thicker neotympanum (P = .0033) than control animals. The experimentally applied BM-MSCs engrafted and differentiated into epithelial cells suggested by the colocalized expression of cytokeratin-19 and GFP., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The topical application of bone marrow-derived MSCs enhances the healing of TMPs in this animal model and is a promising alternative to tympanoplasty.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2016.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To explore the technique of hearing reconstruction in the cases of conductive hearing loss with malformed tympanic segment of facial nerve., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Data of 10 cases from July 2010 to March 2015 were collected. The status of tympanic segment of facial nerve, malformed ossicles and the reconstructed methods of ossicular chain were analyzed and discussed based on the embryo anatomy and surgical technique., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All facial nerves in 10 cases were exposed and drooping to stapes or cover the oval window.Three patients who had normal stapes, pushed by the exposed facial nerve, were reconstructed with partial ossicular replacement prostheses (PORP). Two patients who had footplate, with partial fixation, were reconstructed with total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORP). Three patients who had atresia of the oval window were implanted with Piston after being made hole in the atresia plate.Another two cases who had atresia of the oval window were implanted with TORP after promontory being drilled out.All cases had no injury of facial nerve and nervous hearing, and no tinnitus.Nine cases had conductive hearing improvement, except one with promontory drilled out., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Patients who had conductive hearing loss with malformed tympanic segment of facial nerve can be treated by the technique of hearing reconstruction. The fenestration technique in the bottom of the scala tympani of the basal turn provides us a new method for treating patients whose oval window was fully covered by malformed facial nerve.

Postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) and ABG closure (postoperative air-conduction threshold-preoperative bone-conduction threshold) were analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The causes of missing stapes superstructure and conductive hearing loss were congenital ossicular anomaly (n = 5), chronic otitis media (n = 2), and congenital cholesteatoma (n = 1). The prosthesis was designed to fit between the medial side of the incus and stapes footplate and had a mean length of 3.6 +/- 0.5 mm. The mean pre- and postoperative ABG were 38.3 +/- 4.8 and 13.3 +/- 10.0 dB, respectively. The postoperative ABG at frequencies of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 kHz were 20.0 +/- 15.4, 16.9 +/- 11.9, 16.3 +/- 10.3, 10.6 +/- 7.3, 12.9 +/- 14.0, and 23.1 +/- 16.2 dB, respectively. The mean ABG closure was 9.5 dB (range, -1.3~35.8 dB). Seven cases obtained the best results (mean ABG closure <=10 dB).

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Endoscopic ear surgery is an emerging technique with recent literature highlighting advantages over the traditional microscopic approach. This study aims to characterize the current status of endoscopic ear surgery in Canada and better understand the beliefs and concerns of the otolaryngology - head & neck surgery community regarding this technique., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A cross-sectional survey study of Canadian otolaryngologists was performed. Members of the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology were contacted though an online survey carried out in 2015., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The majority of participants in this study (70%) used an endoscope in their practice, with a large proportion utilizing the endoscope for cholesteatoma or tympanoplasty surgery. To date, 38 Canadian otolaryngologists (70% of respondents) have used an endoscope for at least 1 surgical case, but only 6 (11%) have performed more than 50 endoscopic cases. Of the otolaryngologists who use endoscopes regularly, the majority still use the microscope as their primary instrument and use the endoscope only as an adjunct during surgery. However, the general attitude surrounding endoscopes is positive; 81% believe that endoscopes have a role to play in the future of ear surgery and 53% indicated they were likely to use endoscopes in their future practice. Participants who were earlier in their practice or who had more exposure to endoscopic techniques in their career were more likely to have a positive stance towards endoscopic ear surgery (p < 0.05, p < 0.01, respectively). The main concern regarding endoscopic ear surgery was the technical challenge of one-handed surgery, while the primary perceived advantage was the reduced rates of residual or recurrent disease., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Endoscopic ear surgery is a new technique that is gaining momentum in Canada and there is enthusiasm for its incorporation into future practice. Further investment in training courses and guidance for those looking to start or advance the use of endoscopes in their practice will be vital in the years to come.

N2  - <ovid:b>UNLABELLED</ovid:b>: The three well recognized tympanoplasty approaches: permeatal, postaural, and endaural, each have advantages and disadvantages. The permeatal approach is suitable only for ears with adequate canal size. The postaural approach limits visualization of the posterior eardrum margin. The endaural approach limits the view of the eardrum's anterior margin. This study describes a modified endaural approach, developed to overcome these limitations. A retrospective case series review and collection of a prospective cohort of patient reported outcome data were undertaken to assess the technique., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: Standard incisions as used in an endaural approach are placed within the ear canal. The novel incision extends from the superior canal incision into the conchal cavum. This allows a flap of the thick, hairbearing skin from both the bony and cartilaginous portions of the canal to be raised, and everted, to provide an excellent view of the entire drum. Perichondrium can be harvested for grafting from the conchal cavum. The clinical charts of all patients operated on by the first author using this technique from 2010-2012 were retrospectively reviewed. The size and position of the perforation, size of the canal, whether primary or revision surgery, graft take rate, hearing results and the occurrence of chondritis/perichondritis were recorded. To investigate the morbidities and the acceptance by the patients of the incision/scar in the conchal cavum, all patients undergoing the procedure in the 8 months up to the end of August 2013 were prospectively recruited to complete a self-assessment Likert scale questionnaire recording postoperative pain, and satisfaction with the cosmesis of the operative site. The clinician recorded if there was any evidence of chondritis/perichondritis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A 100% graft take rate was achieved in the 75 adults treated by the first author from 2010 to 2012 regardless of the size and position of the perforation, configuration of the canal, primary or revision surgery. Preoperative Pure Tone Audiometric (PTA) Air Bone Gap (ABG) averaged over 3 frequencies (0.5, 1 and 2 K Hz) was 19.4dB (standard deviation = 9.6, range 2 to 50). Postoperative PTA ABG average was 6.2 dB (standard deviation = 8.3, range -7 to 37), demonstrating a statistically significant post-surgery mean improvement of 13.2 dB (paired T-test, p < 0.001). Twenty-one patients who underwent the procedure in 2013, reported minimal postoperative analgesic use, and scored the acceptability of the incision scar highly (4.8 out of a maximum of 5). There was no case of chondritis/perichondritis in the 96 cases., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Whilst it is the surgeon's decision to use a permeatal, postaural or endaural approach, the endaural approach with the conchal cavum modification is an excellent alternative to the traditionally described approaches., <ovid:b>TRIAL REGISTRATION</ovid:b>:, <ovid:b>CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER</ovid:b>: NCT02000843 at ClinicalTrials.gov.

N2  - Prostheses replacing the incus in its normal position and equipped with two joints might transfer sound as effectively as the intact ossicular chain and allow adjustment to quasi-static pressure changes. A prerequisite for prostheses development is the access to dimensions and distances of the ossicular chain which are necessary to conceptualize shape and size. Fifteen cadaveric human temporal bone specimens were investigated by means of micro-CT followed by 3D analysis. Each specimen was scanned three times: after removal of incus, after additional removal of the malleus head, and after approaching the umbo to the promontory. Artificial umbo medialization as a surrogate for quasi-static pressure changes leads to relevant variations in the distance between the upper part of the malleus and the stapes. Prostheses replacing the incus in its normal position should be equipped with a sliding ball joint or similar construction to allow adjustment to quasi-static pressure changes.

N2  - Knowledge of the vascularization of the malleus may help to better understand some unwanted effects occurred in those surgical techniques using the handle as an attachment site of ossicle-replacement prostheses. Our hypothesis is that vascular damage occurred in the long process of the malleus during tympanic membrane detachment before fastening a malleovestibulopexy (MVP) prosthesis promotes the lysis of this ossicle at the attachment site. To confirm this premise, we carried out an evolutive and descriptive study of ten MVP procedures as well as a morphological analysis of ten cadaveric mallei using both light and scanning electron microscopies. The arterial supply of the manubrium comes from two main sources: vascular branches that reach this ossicle from the site of insertion of the tensor tympani tendon and small perforating branches which penetrate the bone from arteries of the tympanic membrane that, following the periosteum/perichondrium, they arrange parallel to the bone. The detachment of the tympanic membrane to fasten a MVP prosthesis causes a damage in the periosteal/perichondral vascular supply of the handle as well as micro-trauma on it, which can promote bone resorption at the point of anchorage by osteoclast stimulation. Respect periosteal vascularization of the manubrium may be important to prevent damage in this ossicle caused by some middle ear reconstruction prostheses.

N2  - The aim of this study was to introduce and discuss the method of preoperative radiological diagnosis to the congenital absence or atresia of the oval window (OW), and the method of surgical treatment. From July 2010 through August 2014, patients with normal external canal and tympanic membrane but conductive hearing loss underwent high resolution CT scan (HRCT). The multi-planar reformation (MPR), a post-processing protocol, was used. The patients with diagnosis of OW atresia and malformed stapes preoperatively underwent surgical treatment. The vestibular drilled-out and promontory drilled-out technique was used to reconstruct the ossicular chain. In the preoperative radiological diagnosis, six patients (ears) were noted to have congenital absence or atresia of the oval window with malformed facial nerve (class 4) and two patients (ears) were found to have footplate fixation (class 2). In the surgical treatment of eight ears, the malformed structure was identified and the ossicular chain reconstruction was made in six ears. The coronal HRCT CT imaging and the MPR post-processing technique can provide us practical and definite information for surgical treatment, especially in the discrimination of OW atresia and the fixed stapedal footplate. The promontory drill-out technique, fenestration in the bottom of the basal turn, provides us a new method in the hearing reconstruction when the area of OW was fully covered by malformed facial nerve. This technique was first reported in the literature.

N2  - To investigate individual stapes surgery practice in the UK, a retrospective study was conducted by postal questionnaire to all 'assumed' stapes-performing otologists. 225 questionnaires were sent out to practicing otologists in the UK. 184 replies (81.8 %) indicated that 134 (72.9 %) otologists perform stapes surgery [stapedectomy (8.2 %), stapedotomy (91.0 %) or other (0.8 %)]. The '6-10 stapes operation per year' category is the most common, with most using general anaesthetic (GA) (78.3 %). Unilateral surgery is advised in 89.6 %, and 96.3 % perform second-side surgery, with all advising the option of a hearing aid prior to surgery. The majority (88.1 %) would fit the prosthesis after removing the stapes, with the top three prostheses being Causse, Smart and Teflon (as described by respondents). 42.5 % always use a vein graft or fat to cover the fenestration, 9.3 % use a laser and 48.5 % carry out the surgery as a day case. For an overhanging facial nerve (less than 50 % of the footplate obscured), the majority stated that it would depend whether they would abandon surgery. 25.4 % have encountered a 'gusher' and 83.6 % would recommend revision surgery. 82.8 % have a registrar present when carrying out stapes operations, but 69.4 % only offer training to trainees with an otological interest. In the UK, stapedotomy is the preferred technique. Most prefer the Causse prosthesis, general anaesthesia and an inpatient stay. Hearing aids are advised prior to surgery. Day-case and inpatient practice is about equal. 'Gushers' are encountered rarely. Revision surgery is advised if a conductive loss returns. Flying is recommended from 6 weeks. Most otologists are willing to teach trainees with an otological interest.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Middle ear surgery increasingly employs endoscopes as an adjunct to or replacement for the operative microscope. We provide a systematic review of endoscope applications in middle ear surgery with an emphasis on outcomes, including the need for conversion to microscope, audiometric findings, length of follow-up, as well as disease-specific outcomes., <ovid:b>DATA SOURCES</ovid:b>: PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL database., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A literature review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations. Articles were categorized based on study design, indication, and use of an endoscope either as an adjunct to or as a replacement for a microscope. Qualitative and descriptive analyses of studies and outcomes data were performed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: One-hundred three articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the identified articles, 38 provided outcomes data. The majority of these studies were moderate quality, retrospective, case-series reports. The indications for use of the endoscope were broad, with the most common being resection of cholesteatoma. In cholesteatoma surgery, endoscope approaches routinely identified residual cholesteatoma in primary and second-look cases. Other outcomes, including robust audiometric data, operating room times, wound healing, and quality of life surveys were not well described., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Endoscopes have consistently been used as an adjunct to the microscope to improve visualization of the tympanic cavity. Recent reports utilize the endoscope exclusively during surgical dissection; however, data comparing patient outcomes following the use of an endoscope to a microscope are lacking. Areas in need of additional research are highlighted., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: NA<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2014 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: A pilot study was performed to investigate the utility of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the repair of blast-induced total or near-total tympanic membrane perforations (TMPs)., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective clinical study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary university hospital., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were treated with 0.10-0.15 mL of bFGF solution applied directly to total or near-total TMPs once daily until the perforations closed or for a maximum of 6 months. The treatment response was monitored via serial otoendoscopy, and audiometric outcomes were evaluated., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Complete TMP closure was achieved in 16 of 17 patients with a blast-induced total or near-total TMP. The mean closure time was 28.4 +/- 10.9 days. The improvement in hearing from pre- to post-treatment was statistically significant. There were no complications or adverse outcomes., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The direct application of bFGF to blast-induced total or near-total TMPs is a promising, minimally invasive alternative to conventional tympanoplasty, with a comparable success rate. As reported in the literature, the closure rate was higher than achieved with spontaneous healing. There was no effect of the inverted edge on healing outcome. The use of bFGF in this setting has immediate therapeutic applications for military personnel with blast-induced TMPs who are stationed in isolated, remote environments.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2015 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare audiometric and functional outcomes between two designs of heat-activated self-crimping stapes prostheses-a modified shape memory circumferential nitinol-Teflon piston versus its predecessor-in patients with otosclerosis., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A retrospective analysis of preoperative and postoperative hearing thresholds., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center and teaching hospital., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: One hundred sixty-three consecutive procedures of primary stapes surgery for clinically proven otosclerosis in 108 women and 55 men with an average age of 46 years., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Stapedotomy and insertion of either a standard or a circumferential stapes prosthesis., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Four-frequency pure-tone average preoperative and postoperative air-bone thresholds were recorded. A secondary outcome measure was stability of the implant, as measured by failure rates., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Success of closure of the air-bone gap to within 10 dB was achieved in 97% and comparable in both groups (original prosthesis, 23.6; standard deviation, 7.3, with the average reduction seen in the circumferential prosthesis group being 22.6, standard deviation, 5.6). All the differences were not statistically significant using two-way analysis of variance. Failure rate for the original piston was 6%, with no failures seen with the circumferential piston., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Both prostheses showed comparable postoperative hearing outcomes, with the circumferential prosthesis being found to be more stable.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To relate poststapedectomy change in tinnitus loudness to change in tinnitus severity., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective, within-subjects., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: A single otology and neurotology subspecialty referral practice., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Forty-nine subjects undergoing stapedectomy completed the study between January 2012 and October 2013. Tinnitus instruments, audiometric data, and demographic information were collected prior to and 1 and 6 months after surgery. Tinnitus loudness was assessed using an 11-point (0 = none; 5 = conversation level; 10 = jet engine) visual analog scale, and severity was measured using the validated Tinnitus Functional Index. The relationship between change in tinnitus loudness and change in tinnitus severity was evaluated using linear regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A linear regression model of change in tinnitus loudness averaged for both ears on a visual analog scale (DELTAVASavg) versus change in Tinnitus Functional Index score (DELTATFI) showed a strong correlation (DELTATFI = 9.35 xDELTAVASavg; R = 0.64; P < .001). An ROC analysis identified DELTAVASavg between 1.5 and 2.0 as the optimal threshold for predicting a clinically significant change in tinnitus severity (DELTATFI >= 13), with sensitivity and specificity of approximately 0.62 and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.64., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: For poststapedectomy patients, a VAS loudness change by 1.5 to 2.0 points averaged for both ears in bilateral tinnitus or ~3 points in unilateral tinnitus has a PPV ~0.64 for a clinically significant change in tinnitus severity.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2015.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Tinnitus is a very common symptom in patients with hearing loss. Several studies have confirmed that hearing restoration using hearing aids or cochlear implants (CIs) has a suppressive effect on tinnitus in users. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of other hearing restoration devices, specifically the middle ear implant (MEI), on changes in tinnitus severity., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: From 2012 to October 2014, 11 adults with tinnitus and hearing loss underwent MEI surgery. Pure-tone audiometry, tinnitus handicap inventory (THI), and visual analog scale scores for loudness, awareness, and annoyance and psychosocial instruments were measured before, immediately after, and 6 months after surgery. Changes in hearing thresholds and THI scores were analyzed and compared with those of 16 CI recipients., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In both MEI and CI groups, significant improvements in tinnitus were found after the surgery. The THI scores improved in 91% of patients in the MEI group and in 56% of those in the CI group. Visual analog scale scores and psychosocial scale scores also decreased after surgery, but there were no statistical differences between the groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The results indicate that the MEI may be as beneficial as the CI in relieving tinnitus in subjects with unilateral tinnitus accompanying hearing loss. Furthermore, this improvement may manifest as hearing restoration or habituation rather than a direct electrical nerve stimulation, which was previously considered as the main mechanism underlying tinnitus suppression by auditory implants.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: That heparin binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF) heals chronic tympanic membrane (TM) perforations at higher rates than fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) in an animal model., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: A nonsurgical treatment for chronic TM perforation would benefit those unable to access surgery or those unable to have surgery, as well as reducing the cost of tympanoplasty. Growth factor (GF) treatments have been reported in the literature with variable success with the lack of a suitable animal providing a major obstacle., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The GFs were tested in a validated mouse model of chronic TM perforation. A bioabsorbable hydrogel polymer was used to deliver the GF at a steady concentration as it dissolved over 4 weeks. A control (polymer only, n = 18) was compared to polymer loaded with HB-EGF (5 mug/ml, n = 18), FGF2 (100 mug/ml, n = 19), and EGF (250 mug/ml, n = 19). Perforations were inspected at 4 weeks., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The healing rates, as defined as 100% perforation closure, were control (5/18, 27.8%), HB-EGF (15/18, 83.3%), FGF2 (6/19, 31.6%), and EGF (3/19, 15.8%). There were no differences between FGF2 (p = 0.80) and EGF (p = 0.31) with control healing rates. HB-EGF (p = 0.000001) showed a significant difference for healing. The HB-EGF healed TMs showed layers similar to a normal TM, whereas the other groups showed a lack of epithelial migration., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study confirms the advantage of HB-EGF over two other commonly used growth factors and is a promising nonsurgical treatment of chronic TM perforations.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This study aims to evaluate whether chronic otitis media (COM) may cause inner ear damages or middle ear surgery may improve this damage with regard to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and tinnitus and dizziness-related disability., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: An observational prospective study was performed on a series of 65 patients (41 males, 24 females; mean age 26.4+/-12.6; range 11 to 62 years) who were diagnosed with COM and were scheduled for surgical intervention at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of the Haydarpasa Numune Education and Research Hospital. Patients were divided into two subgroups as tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy group according to the surgical procedure. Standard patient work-up included otomicroscopy, pure tone audiometry and completion of the Turkish translation of Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) before surgery and eight weeks after surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: We found higher bone conduction thresholds in the group of patients with mastoidectomy preoperatively. There was a statistically significant difference in the mean preoperative and postoperative THI and DHI scores between the groups (p<0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Our study results suggest that a successful surgery results in improved tinnitus and vertigo symptoms in patients with COM.

N2  - <ovid:b>IMPORTANCE</ovid:b>: The main objective in the treatment of chronic otitis media is to relieve drainage and to rehabilitate hearing. Various materials can be used to repair the tympanic membrane (TM) through different tympanoplasty techniques., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess the results of endoscopic type I tympanoplasty in pediatric patients using tragal cartilage as a grafting material., <ovid:b>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS</ovid:b>: In this prospective study, we studied 80 ears in 80 pediatric patients (ages, 5-17 years) who had undergone type I tympanoplasty from January 2011 to December 2013 at a tertiary referral hospital. We classified our patients into a younger group (<=10 years; n = 40) and an older group (>10 years; n = 40). Patients were followed for up to 6 months., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Endoscopic type I tympanoplasty using split-thickness tragal cartilage., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</ovid:b>: We identified the following criteria for success: (1) healing of the TM (anatomical success) and (2) improvement in hearing by assessing the change in the air-bone gap (ABG). We also assessed the mean operation duration and the different prognostic factors., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Healing of the TM healing occurred in 34 patients (85%) in the younger group vs 36 patients (90%) in the older group. Both groups had notable improvement compared with the preoperative measurements, with no significant differences between the 2 groups. Thirty patients (75%) in the younger group had improvement in their ABG vs 32 patients (80%) in the older group, with a mean ABG of 8.0 dB and 10.5 dB in the younger and older groups, respectively. Both groups had significant functional success with no significant differences between the 2 groups. Sixty patients (75%) displayed a type A tympanogram at their 6-month postoperative audiometric testing (28 patients in the younger group vs 32 patients in the older group). There were no statistically significant differences regarding the anatomical and functional success between the patients who had previously undergone adenotonsillectomy and the other patients. The mean (SD) operation duration was 55.03 (2.50) minutes., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE</ovid:b>: In pediatric patients undergoing type I tympanoplasty, the endoscopic approach using the tragal cartilage as a grafting material resulted in successful anatomical and functional outcomes that are in comparable to other techniques but with a shorter operation duration. Age of the patient, auditory tube dysfunction, and previous adenotonsillectomy were not prognostic factors for this procedure.

N2  - The results of surgical treatment of 62 patients, suffering chronic purulent middle otitis, were analyzed. The structure of mastoid processus and attic constitutes a base for choice of middle ear surgical sanation. Sanation operation with preservation or reconstruction of external acoustical meatus posterior wall was finished with combined mastoidoplasty using autobone, spongioid bone bioimplant Tutoplast or bioceramic material "Sintekost". Achievement of a steady sanating effect have promoted in late postoperative period a trustworthy lowering of the perception threshold of the bone--conducted sounds as on vocal, and also on high frequencies, while of the air--conducted sounds--on vocal frequencies. This permits in perspective to perform a hearing--improving operations with good functional result.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the audiological, surgical, quality of life, and quality of sound outcomes in adults with open cavities implanted with the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) implant using round window (RW) vibroplasty approach., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Otolaryngology department, tertiary referral hospital., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Twelve adult patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss, all with previous middle ear surgery, underwent RW vibroplasty in an open cavity. Compound action potential thresholds were assessed during surgery. Surgical complications were recorded. Subjective benefit was evaluated using the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire (NCIQ), Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), and Hearing Implant Sound Quality Index (HISQUI29) tests., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Mean follow-up was 42 months (range 12-76). There was no significant change in bone conduction thresholds after surgery. Mean functional gain was 34.3 dB and speech discrimination score at 65 dB significantly improved from 14 to 83%. Extrusion of the wire link was the main surgical complication in four patients. All NCIQ domains improved after surgery. All patients had a positive overall GBI score (mean 35.0). Mean HISQUI29 score was 152.8, on average the quality of sound being defined as "very good.", <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: VSB is an effective method of hearing restoration for adults with open cavities suffering from conductive or mixed hearing loss. Intraoperative electrocochleography may be considered of significant help to check the coupling to the inner ear. The high rate of extrusion suggests that middle ear obliteration may be considered in these patients.

N2  - <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) imaging technique has proved to be reliable for assessing the appropriate positioning of the floating mass transducer (FMT) in the round window (RW) niche, although some parameters do not seem to be essential for achieving a satisfactory functional outcome., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate the role that specific imaging parameters derived from CBCT of the temporal bone have for predicting the functional outcome after RW vibroplasty (RW-VP)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: CBCT imaging was carried out in a homogeneous group of patients who presented with a mixed type of hearing loss after open tympanoplasty. Three arbitrary radiological parameters were taken into account: the FMT/RW membrane contact, bony contacts of the FMT margins, and the inferior FMT tissue support. The audiological assessment took into consideration the PTA4 (500-4000 Hz), the PTA2 (125-250 Hz), and the word recognition score (WRS) in quiet and in noise., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: One subject presented with all positive CBCT parameters and showed a good, but not the best auditory performance among the study group. In the majority of the subjects, with a satisfactory postoperative hearing improvement, at least two of the three radiological parameters were present. In comparison with the unaided condition, an improvement in both the PTA4 and PTA2 was found in all the subjects.

N2  - <ovid:b>IMPORTANCE</ovid:b>: More than 500,000 children undergo tonsillectomy each year in the United States. Although prior studies suggest that most patients received perioperative antibiotics, practice varies across centers. In 2011, the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) published a practice guideline recommending against perioperative antibiotic use for pediatric tonsillectomy. The impact of this recommendation has not been thoroughly examined., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To determine the impact of the AAO-HNS guideline on the use of perioperative antibiotics and patient outcomes for pediatric tonsillectomy., <ovid:b>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS</ovid:b>: This was a quasi-experimental study including 9265 children who underwent routine tonsillectomy from January 2009 through August 2012 within a large pediatric health care network containing hospital-based and ambulatory surgical facilities. Data were collected from a shared electronic health record and validated through manual medical record review. We used an interrupted time series analysis with segmented logistic regression and a nonequivalent dependent variable (tympanoplasty) to assess acute changes and differences in trends over time relative to guideline publication., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Publication of the AAO-HNS clinical practice guideline., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</ovid:b>: The primary outcome was antibiotic administration on the day of surgery. Secondary outcomes included otolaryngology clinic encounters, emergency department encounters, hospital admissions, and surgical procedures for bleeding in the 30 days following tonsillectomy., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of 9265 tonsillectomies during the study period, 5359 met inclusion criteria. Immediately after guideline publication, perioperative antibiotic use dropped by 86.5% (P < .001) and was sustained throughout the postintervention period. Rates of otolaryngology clinic encounters, emergency department encounters, and hospital admissions did not change significantly over time. There was a small but statistically significant increase in surgical procedures for bleeding following the intervention from 1.35% (95% CI, 0.57%-2.14%) to 3.48% (95% CI, 1.85%-5.10%)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE</ovid:b>: AAO-HNS guideline publication decreased perioperative antibiotic use for pediatric tonsillectomy across a large pediatric health care network. Although there were no changes in otolaryngology clinic visits, emergency department visits, or admissions, we found a small but significant increase in surgery for bleeding following guideline publication. Additional studies are necessary to verify this unexpected association.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to assess the objective and subjective long-term binaural benefits of surgical correction in children with unilateral congenital aural atresia, using an open-set sentence test in noise and subjective questionnaires., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: A prospective study was performed between August 2010 and February 2013. This study included pediatric patients who had unilateral conductive hearing loss (normal bone conduction hearing) on the atretic side but normal air conduction hearing on the normal side and were scheduled to undergo a primary canaloplasty. Pure-tone audiometry, the hearing in noise test (HINT), and questionnaires (Sound-Spatial-Qualities of Hearing Scale; Glasgow Benefit Inventory [GBI]) were administered preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Among 34 consecutive patients who initially met enrollment criteria, 26 subjects (23 boys and 3 girls) aged 10 to 16 years (mean 12.3 years) completed this study. Canaloplasty and hearing restoration procedures were performed uneventfully in all patients. The mean air conduction thresholds were significantly improved from 63.9 to 35.0 dB (6 months) and 39.4 dB (12 months) after surgery (p < 0.001). In HINT, speech understanding in noise that was presented toward the newly opened atretic ear significantly improved at 1 year postoperatively (p = 0.014). In noise toward the normal ear, speech understanding significantly improved after surgery, from -0.1 dB preoperatively to -2.0 dB at 6 months (p = 0.002) and -1.8 dB at 12 months (p = 0.005) (p for quadratic trend = 0.036). The composite score improved from -2.6 dB preoperatively to -3.4 dB at 6 months and -3.6 dB at 12 months (p = 0.045; p for linear trend = 0.005). The Sound-Spatial-Qualities of Hearing Scale scores in all domains significantly improved 1 year after surgery (p < 0.034). The mean GBI scores in each domain ranged from 14.2 to 49.4. Total GBI score was correlated with better signal to noise ratio in noise toward the atretic ear as measured by HINT at postoperative 1 year (Spearman rho = 0.482, p = 0.013)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Teenaged patients with unilateral congenital aural atresia showed satisfactory hearing improvement after canaloplasty with hearing restoration surgery. In a serial long-term follow-up, speech understanding in noise measured by HINT improved over time. One year after surgery, teenaged children acquired binaural hearing (binaural squelch), as measured by the HINT with noise presented to the newly opened atretic ear. Subjective questionnaires also showed improvements in binaural hearing function and quality of life.

N2  - For several centuries silver is known for its antibacterial effects. The middle ear is an interesting new scope for silver application since chronic inflammations combined with bacterial infection cause complete destruction of the fragile ossicle chain and tympanic membrane. The resulting conductive deafness requires tympanoplasty for reconstruction. Strategies to prevent bacterial growth on middle ear prostheses are highly recommended. In this study, rabbits were implanted with Bioverit R II middle ear prostheses functionalized with silver containing dense and nanoporous silica films which were compared with pure silica coatings as well as silver sulfadiazine cream applied on nanoporous silica coating. The health status of animals was continuously monitored; blood was examined before and after implantation. After 21 days, the middle ears were inspected; implants and mucosal samples were processed for electron microscopy. Autopsies were performed and systemic spreading of silver was chemically analyzed exemplarily in liver and kidneys. For verification of direct cytotoxicity, NIH 3T3 cells were cultured on similar silver containing silica coatings on glass up to 3 days. In vitro a reduced viability of fibroblasts adhering directly on the samples was detected compared to cells growing on the surrounding plastic of the same culture dish. In transmission electron microscopy, phagocytosed silver silica fragments, silver sulfadiazine cream as well as silver nanoparticles were noticed inside endosomes. In vivo, clinical and post mortem examinations were inconspicuous. Chemical analyses showed no increased silver content compared to controls. Mucosal coverages on almost all prostheses were found. But reduction of granulation tissue was only obvious around silver-coated implants. Single necroses and apoptosis in the mucosa were correlated by intracellular accumulation of metallic silver. For confirming supportive healing effects of middle ear implants, silver ion aggregates need to be tested in the future to optimize biocompatibility while assuring bactericidal effects in the middle ear.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; The Author(s) 2015 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

Median follow-up was 7.5 months. On crude analysis, the incidence of anatomical success was not significantly different between the different age groups (p=0.38), the success rate was respectively 69.4%, 68.5% and 79.1% with an overall rate of 72.5%. 5.9% of all children required later insertion of tympanostomy tubes, 10.2% in preschool children. The post-operative audiology results were similar for all groups with a mean improvement of 9dB in the air-bone gap. When limiting the analysis to the 155 children having at least 6 months of follow-up, the rate of success was respectively 50.0%, 60.8% and 74.0% (p=0.10). After multivariate analysis controlling for the effect of surgeon, approach and etiology, the odds ratio of perforation was respectively 5.48, 2.27 and 1.00 for the different age groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Children younger than 4 years of age have the worst outcome after tympanoplasty. It remains uncertain whether the benefits of hearing improvement and quality of life may outweigh that of a high rate of a residual, usually smaller, perforation. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results and delineate the patient characteristics and technique most likely to lead to successful results.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Chronic inflammation can irreversibly damage components of the ossicular chain which may lead to sound conduction deafness. The replacement of impaired ossicles with prostheses does not reduce the risk of bacterial infections which may lead to loss of function of the implant and consequently to additional damage of the connected structures such as inner ear, meninges and brain. Therefore, implants that could do both, reconstruct the sound conduction and in addition provide antibacterial protection are of high interest for ear surgery. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are promising novel biomaterials that have previously been used as an antibiotic-releasing implant coating to curb bacterial infections in the middle ear. However, animal studies of LDHs are scarce and there exist only few additional data on the biocompatibility and hardly any on the biodegradation of these compounds. In this study, middle ear prostheses were coated with an LDH compound, using suspensions of nanoparticles of an LDH containing Mg and Al as well as carbonate ions. These coatings were characterized and implanted into the middle ear of healthy rabbits for 10 days. Analysis of the explanted prostheses showed only little signs of degradation. A stable health constitution was observed throughout the whole experiment in every animal. The results show that LDH-based implant coatings are biocompatible and dissolve only slowly in the middle ear. They, therefore, appear as promising materials for the construction of controlled drug delivery vehicles.

N2  - Living systems such as cells and tissues are extremely sensitive to their surrounding physico-chemical microenvironment. In the field of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, the maintenance of culture conditions suitable for the formation of proliferation niches, for the self-renewal maintenance of stem cells, or for the promotion of a particular differentiation fate is an important issue that has been addressed using different strategies. A number of investigations suggests that a particular cell behavior can be in vitro resembled by mimicking the corresponding in vivo conditions. In this context, several biomimetic environments have been designed in order to control cell phenotypes and functions. In this review, we will analyze the most recent examples of the control of the in vitro physical micro/nano-environment by exploiting an innovative technique of high resolution 3D photolithography, the two-photon polymerization (2pp). The biomedical applications of this versatile and disruptive computer assisted design/manufacturing technology are very wide, and range from the fabrication of biomimetic and nanostructured scaffolds for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, to the microfabrication of biomedical devices, like ossicular replacement prosthesis and microneedles.

N2  - In this study, we describe three unrelated Japanese patients with hearing loss and symphalangism who were diagnosed with proximal symphalangism (SYM1), atypical multiple synostosis syndrome (atypical SYNS1) and stapes ankylosis with broad thumb and toes (SABTT), respectively, based on the clinical features. Surgical findings in the middle ear were similar among the patients. By next-generation and Sanger sequencing analyses, we identified two novel mutations, c.559C>G (p.P178A) and c.682T>A (p.C228S), in the SYM1 and atypical SYNS1 families, respectively. No pathogenic changes were found in the protein-coding regions, exon-intron boundaries or promoter regions of the NOG, GDF5 or FGF9 genes in the SABTT family. Such negative molecular data suggest there may be further genetic heterogeneity underlying SYNS1, with the involvement of at least one additional gene. Stapedotomy resulted in good hearing in all patients over the long term, indicating no correlation between genotype and surgical outcome. Given the overlap of the clinical features of these syndromes in our patients and the molecular findings, the diagnostic term 'NOG-related-symphalangism spectrum disorder (NOG-SSD)' is advocated and an unidentified gene may be responsible for this disorder.

N2  - The objective of this study was to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after sequential cholesteatoma surgery including exclusively transcanal technique (ETC), combined transcanal transmastoidal technique (TCM) and canal wall down surgery with obliteration (CWD). It was a clinical case study conducted in a tertiary referral center. 97 patients at least 12 months after cholesteatoma surgery were included. Interventions included sequential cholesteatoma surgery with ETC, TCM or CWD; ossiculoplasty with partial and total ossicular replacement prostheses. HRQOL assessed by Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 including an overall score and three subscores ('ear symptoms', 'hearing function' and 'mental health') as well as a general evaluation of HRQOL and the frequency of physician consultations, audiometric outcome related to HRQOL were the main outcome measures. Patients, who had undergone sequential cholesteatoma surgery, showed moderate restrictions in HRQOL postoperatively. Stratified for the three surgical techniques, patients receiving ETC tended to report lower restrictions in HRQOL. The ETC group offered a significantly lower value in the subscore 'ear symptoms'. The 'hearing function' was attributed to be the most restriction criteria for all techniques. The overall score and all subscores correlated moderately with the postoperative air conduction threshold. The strongest correlation coefficient was achieved for the subscore 'hearing function' (r(s) = 0.49, p < 0.001). Sequential cholesteatoma surgery offers acceptable moderate restrictions in HRQOL postoperatively. Patients receiving canal wall down surgery with obliteration showed equivalent limitations in HRQOL compared to closed techniques (ETC, TCM). The postoperative air conduction threshold was shown not to be a sufficient indicator for HRQOL. Therefore, disease-specific validated and reliable measuring instruments for HRQOL should be transferred from clinical research to clinical practice to provide an individualized postoperative assessment after cholesteatoma surgery.

N2  - A retrospective evaluation of glass ionomer cement (GIC) in middle ear surgery with emphasis on short- and long-term safety was conducted at the tertiary referral center. GIC was applied between 1995 and 2006 in 444 patients in otologic surgery. Technical aspects, safety, benefits and complications due to GIC were analysed until 2011 (follow-up 5-16 years; mean 10 years). GIC was applied in stapes surgery (228 primary, 92 revisions), cochlear implants (108) and implantable hearing aids (7), ossiculoplasty (7), for coverage of opened mastoid air cells towards the external ear canal (1) and inner ear fistula closure (1). GIC turned out to be very handy in stapes surgery for optimal prosthesis fixation at the incus (260) and on the malleus handle (60) without complications. Results suggest that GIC may diminish the danger of incus necrosis in primary stapedotomy. In cochlear implants and implantable hearing aids, GIC was used for casing alone (74), casing and electrode fixation (27) and electrode alone fixation (14). Inflammatory reactions were observed in five cases (4.3%), mostly after trauma. Broken cement fragments appeared to promote foreign body rejection. In seven cases an incudo-stapedial gap was repaired with GIC with excellent hearing gain; in three cases (43%) revision surgery was needed due to cement breakage. In one case, GIC was applied for a watertight coverage of opened mastoid cells, and in the other for fistula closure of the lateral semi-circular canal over cartilage, covered with bone pathe; follow-up was uneventful. Targeted use of GIC in middle ear surgery rarely poses problems. GIC cannot be used in neuro-otosurgery in contact with cerebrospinal fluid because of possible aluminium encephalopathy.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To identify the preoperative factors that influence the success rate of type I tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A total of 247 type I tympanoplasty procedures were included in the present study. We determined the effects of the following preoperative variables on the anatomical and functional outcomes of type I tympanoplasty in order to identify prognostic preoperative factors: age (<16 years vs. >16 years), history of ear surgery, state of the contralateral ear (healthy vs. diseased), size of perforation, presence of septal pathology, presence of adenoid disease and history of smoking. Additionally, we stratified the surgical procedures according to the type of graft materials used and analyzed the effects of the above preoperative variables on the success rates of each type of procedure separately in order to eliminate the confounding effect of surgical technique., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The study was conducted on 217 subjects (130 females, 87 males) who underwent a total of 247 surgical procedures. The graft take rate was significantly higher after tympanoplasty with perichondrium-cartilage island flap (PCIF) grafts than after tympanoplasty with temporalis fascia (TF) grafts (87.8% vs. 72.3%, p=0.008). Young age (p=0.013), presence of adenoid hypertrophy (p=0.001) and abnormality of the contralateral ear (p=0.027) were associated with lower success rates after tympanoplasty with TF grafts. The success rate of tympanoplasty with PCIF grafts was not affected by any of the preoperative variables we tested. Postoperative audiometry showed that the improvement in hearing ability did not differ between patients who received TF grafts and those who received PCIF grafts (p=0.325)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Tympanoplasty with cartilage grafts was associated with better graft takes and comparable hearing outcomes than those associated with tympanoplasty with TF grafts. In patients with risk factors such as contralateral ear disease, a young age or adenoid disease, cartilage-perichondrium grafts are preferable to TF grafts.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The aims of the study were to assess health-related quality of life and hearing-related disability in subjects with otosclerosis 30 years after surgery., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: An observational study was performed. Medical records were reviewed, a clinical examination as well as audiometric assessments were performed. Generic health-related quality of life was assessed by the SF-36v2 and hearing disability by a shortened version of SSQ (speech spatial and qualities of hearing scale)., <ovid:b>STUDY SAMPLE</ovid:b>: Sixty-five individuals, who had undergone stapedectomy in 1977-79 at a tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Generic health-related quality of life according to SF-36 subscale scores was comparable to that of an age- and sex-matched reference population. The SF-36 mental component summary score (MCS) was, however, significantly better than that of the reference population. The mental and physical summary component scores correlated significantly to hearing disability measured by the SSQ but not to hearing impairment. Hearing disability was displayed in all SSQ sub-scores, especially in more complex listening situations and in the localization of sounds., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: This study shows that individuals with otosclerosis, 30 years after surgery, have a good generic health-related quality of life, despite moderate to severe hearing loss and significant hearing disabilities.

N2  - To pilot a substantive randomized control trial comparing post-operative external ear canal pack with no ear pack after middle ear surgery, 32 adults undergoing primary posterior bony canal wall preserving middle ear surgery were randomized to have either a bismuth iodoform paraffin paste pack or no ear pack post-operatively. Outcome measures included clinician- and patient-recorded visual analogue scale scores for ear signs and symptoms at 3 weeks and 3 months and audiometric findings at 3 months post-operatively. There was no statistically significant inter-group difference in 3-week clinician and patient cumulative scores for ear signs and symptoms. There was also no significant difference in graft take rate, appearance of ear canals and audiometric results in either group at 3 months. No difference in ear symptoms, clinician findings or hearing was demonstrated between patients with a post-operative pack compared to those without a pack following middle ear surgery in this pilot study.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Facial nerve injury is a rare complication of middle ear surgery. To date there is no widely accepted consensus on the use of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring during middle ear surgery, whereas its use has been proved as a valuable adjunct in neurotologic surgery. The purpose of our study was to identify introperative facial nerve monitoring practice patterns in France for middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A 19-item survey has been made up by three experienced otologists under the auspices of the French Otology and Neurotology Association. With the support of the French Society of Otolaryngology--Head and Neck Surgery, the survey was electronically sent by email to 1249 practicing ENT with a valid email address. Answers were analyzed two months later., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Among 1249 email sent, 299 were opened (24%) and 83 answers were collected (6,6%). Of the respondents, 66% had access to intraoperative facial nerve monitoring. Otolaryngologists involved in academic setting were influenced by their teaching duty in 27%. Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring should not be required for stapes surgery, ossiculoplasty, myringoplasty for, respectively, 92%, 93 % and 98% of the respondents. In cochlear implantation, 78% of ear surgeons used facial nerve monitoring. Answers were more controversial for chronic ear surgery, ear atresia and middle ear implant. Revision surgery and CT scan can influence answers., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Despite a low response rate, results of this national survey revealed interesting findings. For most of the respondents, intraoperative facial nerve monitoring was not indicated in stapes surgery, myringoplasty and ossiculoplasty. The use of intraoperative facial nerve monitoring for cochlear implantation was supported by the majority of respondents. Variations in response rate were more significant for chronic ear surgery, including middle ear cholesteatoma, and for ear atresia surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the clinical value of heterogeneous acellular dermalmatrix with autologous bone meal in open tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: Twenty-eight cases (30 ears) with middle ear cholesteatoma were trea- ted by open tympanoplasty and repaired by heterogeneous acellular dermalmatrix autologous bone meal on study team. Twenty-two cases (22 ears) with middle ear cholesteatoma were treated by open tympanoplasty on control team. All patients were followed up for 12 to 18 months and assessed the fuction postoperatively., <ovid:b>RESULT</ovid:b>: The re- construction of external auditory canal structure is close to normal, and no narrow happens on study team. The rate of dry ear was about 90%. All cases had no recurrence of cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Application of decellu- larized dermal matrix with autologous bone meal can rise early to cover the wound, promote wound healing and to reduce the external auditory canal, reduce the effect of granulation and scar formation. It is a kind of method of repair to be promoted.

N2  - In this paper, we report the postoperative outcomes in canal wall up procedures with second stage surgery in 40 children undergoing intervention for cholesteatoma of the middle ear. The residuals, recurrences and the hearing results were analysed. All 40 patients had a follow-up of at least five years. Of the 39 patients who underwent two staged surgery, 18 (46.1%) had a residual lesion that was identified and excised during the second surgery. Over a five year follow-up period, there were five (12.5%) patients with recurrences, all belonging to the group in whom a residual cholesteatoma was identified during the second staged surgery. The rate of residual cholesteatoma tends to decrease as age increases. The type of cholesteatoma, acquired or congenital middle ear, were not statistically related to the incidence of residual cholesteatoma. Hearing analysis showed that hearing recovery was excellent with canal wall up procedures and remained stable over five years.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Otologic trauma was the most common physical injury sustained after the April 15, 2013, Boston Marathon bombings. The goal of this study is to describe the resultant otologic morbidity and to report on early outcomes., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Multi-institutional prospective cohort study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Children and adults seen for otologic complaints related to the Boston Marathon bombings comprised the study population. Participants completed symptom assessments, quality-of-life questionnaires, and audiograms at initial and 6-month visits. Otologic evaluation and treatment, including tympanoplasty results, were reviewed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: More than 100 patients from eight medical campuses have been evaluated for blast-related otologic injuries; 94 have enrolled. Only 7% had any otologic symptoms before the blasts. Ninety percent of hospitalized patients sustained tympanic membrane perforation. Proximity to blast (RR = 2.7, p < 0.01) and significant nonotologic injury (RR = 2.7, p < 0.01) were positive predictors of perforation. Spontaneous healing occurred in 38% of patients, and tympanoplasty success was 86%. After oral steroid therapy in eight patients, improvement in hearing at 2 and 4 kHz was seen, although changes did not reach statistical significance. Hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty hearing in noise remain persistent and, in some cases, progressive complaints for patients. Otologic-specific quality of life was impaired in this population., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Blast-related otologic injuries constitute a major source of ongoing morbidity after the Boston Marathon bombings. Continued follow-up and care of this patient population are warranted.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: In the surgical management of cholesteatoma, one can opt for a closed technique (simple mastoidectomy) or open surgery (radical mastoidectomy). Open mastoidectomy with reconstruction of the posterior wall and the middle ear in a single surgery combines the advantages of both techniques, namely, adequate surgical exposure, eradication of cholesteatoma, and anatomical reconstruction of the middle ear structures., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the surgical results in the management of cholesteatoma through the technique of open mastoidectomy with reconstruction of the posterior wall and the middle ear in a single surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Prospective analytical observational study conducted between 2009 and 2012 with patients undergoing this surgical technique in the Hospital Universitario del Valle [University Hospital of Valle], performing preoperative clinical monitoring and quarterly postoperative tomography with previous assessments of hearing and pre- and postoperative audiometry., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Forty-five patients were studied. Mean postoperative follow-up was 28 months. Surgical success was achieved in 93.3% of patients, as measured by clinical and radiological follow-up. Hearing preservation was found after reconstruction of the hearing mechanism, based on measured audiometry, i.e., pure-tone average (PTA), using the statistical test for paired samples between preoperative and postoperative PTA. (95%CI -1.47-12.15). Residual cholesteatoma was present in 6.6% of cases; three to four times lower than the rate reported in the literature., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: This type of surgery can be considered a successful technique in the treatment of cholesteatoma in selected cases.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate postoperative hearing outcomes after lateral temporal bone resection (LTBR) with reconstruction of the external auditory canal (EAC) and conductive function for early-stage EAC carcinoma., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We retrospectively examined patients diagnosed with early-stage EAC carcinoma treated with surgery alone between January 2006 and December 2012. Patients who had postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were excluded. Patients receiving LTBR in combination with tympanoplasty were divided into two groups based on the reconstruction of the EAC with and without (w/o) split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs). Audiological data included the preoperative hearing thresholds and the most recent postoperative hearing thresholds obtained at least 12 months after surgery. The hearing outcome was evaluated based on pure-tone audiograms using the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery for the evaluation of the results of treatment of conductive hearing loss. The postoperative quality of life (QOL) for patients was evaluated using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All patients (n = 15) achieved disease-free survival without significant morbidity or mortality. When we compared the mean air-bone gaps after surgery, those in the STSG group (n = 8) were found to be significantly lower than those in the w/o STSG group (n = 7; p < 0.001). The success rate for postoperative hearing was 75.0% in the STSG group, which was significantly higher than that in the w/o STSG group (p = 0.014). All patients in the w/o STSG group showed stenosis and closure of the EAC at fewer than 10 months after surgery. In contrast, all patients in the STSG group showed preserved conformation of the new EAC for more than 12 months after surgery. When we compared the mean GBI score between the two groups of patients, the overall and general health scores in the STSG group were found to be significantly higher than those in the w/o STSG group (p = 0.021, p = 0.001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Reconstruction of the EAC using a rolled-up STSG technique in combination with tympanoplasty after LTBR is useful for hearing preservation and the observation of locoregional lesions after surgery, resulting in improved QOL for patients.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2014 S.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Adhesion formation is a frequent and serious post-operative problem in ENT surgery. This study assessed the effect of two anti-adhesive haemostatic agents on an experimental guinea pig model., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The middle-ear mucosa of 14 guinea pigs was exposed to surgical trauma. After surgery, Arista TM AH was injected into the right middle ear of seven animals, while Ankaferd Blood Stopper was injected into the right middle ear of the other seven animals. The left ears were left untreated and regarded as the control group. The three groups were compared by histological examination at post-operative week 4., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In each of the three groups, consolidation of the lamina propria and epithelium mucosae, increments in the number of active fibroblasts, collagen fibrils and inflammatory cells, and increased vascular dilation were observed on haematoxylin and eosin-stained sections, and were more prominent in the control and Ankaferd Blood Stopper groups. Epithelial thickness and capillary vasodilation were significantly lower in the Arista TM AH group compared with the control and Ankaferd Blood Stopper groups (p < 0.008)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Arista TM AH may prevent the formation of adhesions in middle-ear surgery. Further experimental studies are required to determine its ototoxic potential.

N2  - The persistent stapedial artery (PSA) is a very rare, congenital, vascular anomaly. It presents as a pulsatile middle ear mass and sometimes causes conductive hearing loss. The diagnosis of the presence of a PSA is always accidental, because it is so rare and difficult to predict. CT findings include the absence of the foramen spinosum and a soft-tissue prominence in the region of the tympanic segment of the facial nerve. The risks of surgery include facial palsy, hemiplegia caused by coagulation of the PSA, and bleeding due to injury of the carotid artery during surgery in cases of aberrant internal carotid. In this article we report a case of PSA with stapes ankylosis for which we performed malleus-stapedotomy using a Teflon wire piston. We did not coagulate the PSA. Nevertheless the PSA attached to the prosthesis, the patient presented significant improvement in hearing level and had no complaint of pulsating tinnitus. Thus, we have shown that attachment of the prosthesis to the PSA does not necessarily disturb improvement of hearing level after malleus-stapedotomy for otosclerosis with PSA. Based on our experience, many cases can be treated by stapedotomy using a prosthesis and without coagulating the PSA.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare anatomic and functional outcomes of the different graft materials used in pediatric tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The patients younger than 18 years of age and who had tympanoplasty between 2010 and 2012 were included in the study. Temporal muscle fascia or cartilage was used as the graft material. The age, gender, the side of the operated ear, the operation technique, pre- and postoperative audiological results, and the status of the graft were noted. An intact graft and an air-bone gap (ABG) <= 20 were regarded as surgical success in the postoperative period. Audiograms obtained before surgery and 1 year after surgery were used for the comparison., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixty pediatric cases were included in the study. Fascia graft was used as the graft material in 35 of them, and cartilage was used in 25 patients. The graft success rate was 82.9% in the fascia group while it was 92% in the cartilage group. In the fascia group preoperative ABG was 28.2 +/- 10.1 dB, postoperative ABG was 15.1 +/- 10.2dB, and postoperative gain was 13.1 +/- 9.6 dB. In the cartilage group, preoperative ABG was 28.9 +/- 10.2dB, and postoperative ABG was 16.8 +/- 10.3 dB with a postoperative gain of 12.1 +/- 6.8 dB. The differences between the fascia and the cartilage groups were not statistically significant either for hearing gain or graft success rate., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Cartilage and fascia grafts yield similar results for hearing gain and graft success rate in pediatric tympanoplasty.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Patulous eustachian tube (PET) can have a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life. Previous work has demonstrated that temporarily mass loading and stiffening the tympanic membrane significantly reduces these symptoms. This study examined KTP laser myringoplasty (LM) and cartilage tympanoplasty (CT) as a means to manipulate the tympanic membrane to alleviate PET symptoms., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective case review., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Academic tertiary care referral hospital., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Patients (n = 20) were identified from the senior authors' (M.B.) specialty eustachian tube disorders clinic. Patients met previously established diagnostic criteria for PET. All patients had a clinically apparent flaccid segment of the eardrum and had symptom improvement after simple mass loading of their eardrum in the clinic., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Patients in this study received either KTP LM (10 patients, 15 ears) or CT (10 patients, 11 ears) to treat their flaccid eardrum segment in an attempt to alleviate PET symptoms., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Preoperative and postoperative questionnaire scores and tympanometry measurements were compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Patients undergoing CT for PET had a significant reduction in their symptoms of autophony (p <= 0.001), conducted breath sounds (p = 0.001), and aural fullness (p = 0.009). KTP LM did not significantly reduce symptoms., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Cartilage tympanoplasty provides a safe and accessible surgical option for the treatment of PET and significantly reduces the symptoms of autophony, conducted breath sounds, and aural fullness. Further studies are needed to investigate whether addressing PET symptoms simultaneously from both the tympanic membrane and the eustachian tube orifice can improve patient symptoms even further.

N2  - In the postoperative ear, following reconstructive tympanoplasty for a mastoid cavity problem, a very important key is to maintain a stable reconstructed posterior canal wall with the bone plate and cartilage in the posterior canal wall. The authors manage reconstruction of the posterior canal wall with the temporal fascial scar tissue flap (TFSF) and the temporal periosteal scar tissue flap (TPSF) to ensure obtaining a stable posterior canal wall and a tympanic membrane graft. Well-vascularized TFSF and TPSF enable us to acquire a solid reconstructed posterior canal wall because of the secure blood supplies to the flaps. In order to investigate the blood supplies of TFSF and TPSF, we employed laser Doppler blood flowmeters and measured blood flow in the flaps in 20 cases of posyoperative ears treated for a mastoid cavity problem. The blood supplies to both flaps were good, with the blood supply to the TFSF being statistically better than in the case of the TPSF. These findings suggested that the TFSF and TPSF were a reliable source of local well-vascularized tissue which were pliable and could facilitate the creation of a stable posterior canal wall. Furthermore it seems the good blood supply was linked to the prompt postoperative healing, the avoidance of postoperative infection, and good hearing improvement postoperatively.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study aimed to analyze the clinical features of patients who underwent surgery for secondary acquired cholesteatoma (SAC)., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The subjects were 30 patients who underwent surgery for SAC in 30 ears. We investigated the age distribution, sex, tympanic membrane (TM) findings, temporal bone pneumatization, morphology of TM epidermis invasion, extent of cholesteatoma invasion, ossicular erosion, surgical methods and surgical results., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There were 10 males (33.3%) and 20 females (66.6%), with a mean age 54.9 years. The TM perforation was medium-sized or larger in 27 ears (90%). Temporal bone pneumatization was poor or bad in 90% (18/20) of the evaluated ears. The cholesteatoma invaded from the malleus manubrium to the promontory in 23 ears (76.7%). There were no patients in whom the cholesteatoma invaded the antrum or mastoid. The ossicles were affected in 19 ears (63.3%). Ossiculoplasty with a columella on the stapes was the most frequent procedure, performed for 16 ears (53.3%). There were no hearing results with a postoperative air-bone gap of more than 31 dB., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Although SAC is rare, it is important for the clinician to keep this type of cholesteatoma in mind.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: A partially or fully absent or largely perforated footplate is a challenging condition that may be encountered during middle ear surgery, especially in patients with a history of chronic ear problems or with previous tympanoplasties., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Retrospective study on a limited number of cases undergoing revision tympanoplasty in which a new footplate was created from the cartilage, and the ossicular chain was reconstructed with a titanium prosthesis in 1 stage. Minimum follow-up was 24 months. Outcome measurements included the preoperative and postoperative bone conduction to assess the function of the inner ear, and the preoperative and postoperative threshold levels of air and bone conduction in 4 frequencies to assess the possible hearing improvement., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Six patients could be included. The audiologic results showed the average air conduction gain of 11 dB. We did not observe any significant deterioration in the bone conduction which, in some cases, even improved (average change of +3 dB). The symptoms related to a perilymphatic fistula were resolved. The technique described herein has proven to be safe and reliable., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Reconstruction of the footplate with autologous cartilage and simultaneous type III tympanoplasty seems to be a promising solution for those rare but challenging cases in which the footplate is partially of fully absent.

We aimed to examine current patterns in the use of FNMs in chronic ear surgery., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Descriptive design (survey)., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Academic health center., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A 10-question survey was designed to identify level of training, scope of practice, specific otologic surgeries where monitoring was most used, and the opinion of respondents regarding the use of FNMs as standard of care for chronic and/or middle ear surgery. A randomized list of 2000 board-certified members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery was generated. One thousand subjects received a mailed survey with a self-addressed return envelope and 1000 subjects received an emailed survey through Surveymonkey.com., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There were 359 (36%) surveys returned by mail and 258 (26%) surveys returned electronically. Forty-three percent of respondents were in private practice, and 31% were fellowship trained in otology/neurotology. Sixty-five percent used a FNM in their training and 95% had regular access to a FNM. Revision mastoid surgery, cholesteatoma, canal wall down mastoidectomy, and facial recess approach were the settings where a FNM was most used. Forty-nine percent of respondents felt that a FNM should be used as the standard of care in chronic ear surgery; this represents an increase from 32% in a similar study done approximately 10 years ago., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: There is a growing trend for routine facial nerve monitoring in the setting of chronic ear surgery.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2014.

N2  - Traditional surgery for cholesteatoma of the middle ear is performed by microscopic approaches. However, in recent years endoscopic instrumentation, techniques and knowledge have greatly improved, and in our opinion endoscopic surgical techniques will gain increasing importance in otologic surgery in the future. The aim of this study was to focus on outcomes obtained using endoscopic surgery for the treatment of middle ear cholesteatoma. A systematic review of the literature was performed. A total of 7 articles comprising 515 patients treated exclusively with endoscope or with a combined technique were found. During post-surgical follow-up, 48 (9.3%) patients showed a residual or recurrent pathology. Despite the small number of patients analyzed in our review, the outcomes of this technique appear to be promising. In particular, concerning the rates of recurrences and residual disease, endoscopic middle ear surgery appears to guarantee similar results in comparison to classic microscopic approaches with the advantage of performing minimally invasive surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The pathogenesis of recurrent cholesteatoma can be roughly divided into residual lesions and re-retraction of the epithelium. To prevent both residual and re-retraction cholesteatoma, we performed canal wall down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration using the bone pate plate for canal wall reconstruction as a fundamental surgical treatment for patients with acquired cholesteatoma. We attempted to achieve the complete extirpation of cholesteatoma in the wide surgical field made by the canal wall down procedure and simultaneously prevent recurrent retraction cholesteatoma and regain the physiologic canal wall, in which patients can have a "maintenance-free ear.", <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The surgical method used in the present study was described, and the long-term postoperative results of this method were evaluated., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective study., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Participants were 118 patients with acquired cholesteatoma who underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration and could be followed-up for more than 5 years., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Postoperative changes in the reconstructed canal wall, the rate of otorrhea, and exposure of the material were examined using endoscopic images, medical charts, and CT scans., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 113 ears (95.8 %) achieved the nearly physiologic appearance of the external auditory canal, and these conditions were maintained throughout the follow-up periods. However, recurrent cholesteatoma was not observed during the follow-up periods. Postoperative otorrhea was observed in 2.5% of ears. Exposure of the bone pate was only noted in 1 patient (0.8 %). Postoperative CT scans confirmed that ossification developed in the bone pate used in the reconstructed canal wall and mastoid surface., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Canal wall down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration using the bone pate plate for canal wall reconstruction prevents both recurrent and residual cholesteatoma and contributes to a good quality of life for the patient.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: For tympanoplasty, the most common grafting materials are the temporalis fascia or perichondrium; however, both require incision of the canal skin, which carries a risk of morbidity and the need for postoperative care. Inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty, by which the perforation edges are refreshed and a cartilage is inserted through the perforation without canal incision, makes the graft easy, and reduces operating and recovery time. We analyze the outcome of inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: This study included 112 patients who underwent tympanoplasty from January 2011 to August 2012. Patients were divided into 2 groups: patients who underwent inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty (Group I, n = 56) and patients who underwent conventional underlay tympanoplasty using the temporalis fascia (Group II, n = 56). Anatomic success was defined as an intact, repaired tympanic membrane, and functional success was defined as a significant decrease in the air-bone gap at the end of follow-up. Perioperative pain was analyzed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). Surgical success, functional success, perioperative pain, and operating time were evaluated and compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The surgical success rate was 96.4% in Group I and 91.1% in Group II (p = 0.435). The mean air-bone gap decrease was 7.9 +/- 2.2 dB in Group I and 8.9 +/- 3.2 dB in Group II (p = 0.426). Group I showed a lower VAS score for pain (1.5 +/- 1.2) and a shorter operation time (25.6 +/- 8.5 min) compared with those of Group II (4.9 +/- 1.7, 48.6 +/- 19.5 min, respectively) (p < 0.01)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Inlay butterfly cartilage tympanoplasty is compatible with the conventional underlay technique in both anatomic and functional success rates. Its simplicity, shorter operation time, and rapid recovery time could make it an attractive surgical option.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: We investigated the outcomes of the endoscopic versus microscopic approach to type 1 tympanoplasty in pediatric patients., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In this retrospective study, the outcomes of 61 ears of 60 pediatric patients (33 male and 27 female) who underwent type 1 tympanoplasty were evaluated. One patient underwent a bilateral operation. The age range of the patients was 7-16 years. Group 1 underwent tympanoplasty with an endoscopic technique (n=32), and Group 2 underwent tympanoplasty with the conventional microscopic technique (n=29). A boomerang-shaped chondroperichondrial graft was used in both groups. The outcomes were analyzed in terms of the hearing gain, duration of surgery, and graft success rate., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In both groups, the postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was significantly lower than the preoperative ABG. There were no significant differences between the preoperative and postoperative ABG values (in dB) in either group. The mean operative duration in Group 1 was significantly lower than that in Group 2 (51.37 vs. 67.03 min, respectively). In the preoperative evaluation, 65.6% of patients in Group 1 had larger perforations and 34.4% had smaller perforations. In Group 2, 58.6% and 41.3% of patients had larger and smaller perforations, respectively. Perforations were detected in two (6.25%), four (12.50%), and four (12.50%) of the patients in Group 1 at postoperative months 1, 6, and 12, respectively. Perforations were detected in two (5.71%) patients in Group 2 at postoperative months 1, 6, and 12. At 12 months postoperatively, there were smaller perforations in four (12.5%) of the children in Group 1 and in two (5.71%) of the children in Group 2. The difference between the perforation conditions (larger vs. smaller) was not significant in either group. The preoperative and postoperative increases in the ABG were associated. The operative duration was shorter in Group 1 than in Group 2., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In pediatric patients undergoing type 1 tympanoplasty, especially if the external ear canal is narrow and the anterior canal wall is prominent, the endoscopic and microscopic approaches appear to give equal results in terms of easy visualization of the entire tympanic membrane and no requirement for extra intervention to evaluate the ossicular system. A shorter operative duration is an advantage of the endoscopic tympanoplasty technique.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

The association between air-bone gain and age, ossiculoplasty material (autologous or titanium), preoperative diagnosis (chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma, cholesteatoma, or conductive hearing loss with intact tympanic membrane), and type of surgery (tympanoplasty, canal wall-down mastoidectomy, or canal wall-up mastoidectomy) was explored using regression analysis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Preoperative audiometric evaluation did not show differences between titanium and autologous groups in air-bone gap and pure-tone average. A postoperative decrease of 11.0 dB in air-bone gap and 12.4 dB in pure-tone average was observed in titanium ossiculoplasty compared with a reduction of 4.0 dB in air-bone gap and 5.1 dB in pure-tone average when autologous reconstruction was used. Mann-Whitney test revealed superior results in the titanium group compared with autologous reconstruction patients in air-bone gap (P = .02) and pure-tone average (P = .02). However, no statistically significant associations were observed after multivariate linear regression analysis of air-bone gap gain when adjusted for age, ossiculoplasty material, type of surgery, and preoperative diagnosis. One titanium prosthesis extrusion occurred during follow-up (2%)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Audiometric results achieved by titanium prosthesis are promising, but significant differences compared with autologous ossiculoplasty were not present.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation 2014.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: The diode laser, with a wavelength of 980 nm, has promising characteristics for being used for the fenestration during stapedotomy. It is known that at this wavelength absorption in pigmented tissues is high, and absorption in water is relatively low compared with medical lasers in the infrared, making it theoretically an applicable laser for stapes surgery in patients with otosclerosis. Another important advantage is that, with respect to other lasers, this device is relatively inexpensive. Despite the potential advantages, the available literature only shows limited reports of this laser being used in stapes surgery. The present article evaluates the thermal, mechanical, and acoustic properties of the diode laser during stapes surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: For the mechanical effects, high-speed imaging with a frame rate up to 4000 f/s (=250 mus resolution) was performed in an inner ear model. For thermal effects, the high-speed Schlieren technique was used. Acoustics were recorded by a hydrophone, incorporated in the model. Pulse settings were 100 ms, 3 W, which are the same settings used during stapes surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The application of the diode laser resulted in limited mechanical and thermal effects. Impulse noise was low with an average of 52 (SD, 7.8) dB (A). Before carbonization of the tip of the delivery laser, fiber enhances ablation of the footplate., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The 980-nm diode laser is a useful tool for laser-assisted stapedotomy in patients with otosclerosis. Mechanical, thermal, and acoustic effects are limited and well within the safety limits.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess change in tinnitus severity after stapedectomy using the validated Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI) at 1 and 6 months in 2 cohorts of subjects with otosclerosis with different preoperative (TFIpre) distress levels., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective within-subjects repeated measures., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Twenty-six subjects completed the study between January 2012 and April 2013. Demographic information, preoperative and postoperative audiometric data at 1 month, and TFI scores measured preoperatively within 1 month of stapedectomy and postoperatively at 1 and 6 months were captured and analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Stapedectomy has its largest effect on tinnitus severity reduction within the first month of surgery. Cohort A (TFIpre > 15, n = 16) DELTATFI mean and median values were ~20 for the intervals preoperatively to 1 month and preoperatively to 6 months (p values < 0.01) and dropped to ~0 for the interval between 1 and 6 months postoperatively. Cohort B (TFIpre < 15, n = 10) DELTATFI mean and median values were ~0 for all time intervals (all pairwise comparison p values > 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Stapedectomy in patients with otosclerosis with more than a small problem with tinnitus (TFIpre > 15) will reduce severity by at least 1 clinical category in ~85% of cases within 6 months of surgery. The majority of patients will experience stable tinnitus suppression within the first postoperative month. In patients with no tinnitus or less than a small problem with tinnitus (TFIpre < 15), stapedectomy carries a 10% risk of transient worsening of tinnitus at 1 month, which resolves by the sixth postoperative month.

N2  - The term torticollis is derived from the Latin words 'tortis' for twisted and 'collum' for neck. Typical features include sudden onset of severe unilateral pain, with restriction of movements and deviation of the neck to that side. Although torticollis is a well recognised abnormality, there is minimal literature identifying it as a sole long-standing complication in otological surgery. We present the case of a 15-year-old boy who developed permanent torticollis following a routine tympanoplasty. A CT of the neck revealed an atlantoaxial rotatory fixation with cross fusion between C1 and C2. This case highlights a rare cause of torticollis resulting from a routine otological procedure. It also differentiates between Grisel's syndrome, which is characterised by atlantoaxial subluxation as opposed to fusion. The role of the multidisciplinary team is imperative and in particular the need for urgent discussion with the neurosurgical team to ensure prompt assessment and management of the patient takes place.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by means of the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), the quality of life of patients who had undergone either intact-canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) or canal wall-down tympanoplasty (CWDT) with mastoid obliteration., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This was a retrospective case review study performed at a tertiary referral center. Among 379 patients affected by middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma operated on between November 2000 and December 2009, 50 patients who underwent ICWT and 50 who underwent CWDT with mastoid obliteration were randomly selected. The CES scores were analyzed for both groups., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The mean scores on the CES were 6.5 +/- 2.1 in patients who underwent CWDT and 6.9 +/- 2.2 in patients treated with ICWT (t = -0.93; p > 0.05). No significant differences between the two groups were found on the activity restriction, symptom, or medical resource subscales (p > 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The results of this study demonstrate that CWDT with mastoid obliteration resulted in a quality of life comparable with that after ICWT. Postoperative hearing loss is the most frequently reported problem for both techniques.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a direct acoustic cochlear implant (DACI) for speech understanding in noise in patients suffering from severe to profound mixed hearing loss (MHL) due to various etiologies compared to the preoperative best-aided condition. The study was performed at five tertiary referral centers in Europe (Belgium, Germany, Poland and Spain). Nineteen adult subjects with severe to profound MHL due to (advanced) otosclerosis, ear canal fibrosis, chronic otitis media, tympanosclerosis or previous cholesteatoma were implanted with a DACI (Codacs TM Investigational Device) combined with a conventional stapes prosthesis. Unaided and aided speech reception scores in quiet and in noise, preoperative and postoperative air and bone conduction thresholds and aided and unaided sound field thresholds were measured prospectively during the study. Subjective benefit analysis was determined through the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit questionnaire. Quality of life was measured by the Health Utilities Index. All subjects were fitted preoperatively with hearing aids and/or a bone conduction implant on a headband before DACI implantation. This allows direct comparison between different hearing rehabilitation solutions. The mean speech reception threshold in noise improved significantly by 7.9 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after activation of the DACI compared to the preoperative best-aided condition. For all 19 subjects, a mean postoperative aided speech reception threshold of 2.6 dB SNR (standard deviation: 8.3 dB) was measured. On average, no significant shift in the bone conduction thresholds was noted 4-5 months after implantation. A mean sound field threshold improvement of 46 and 16 dB was measured compared to the preoperative unaided and best-aided condition, respectively. Speech perception tests in quiet showed a mean improvement of the word recognition scores by 65 and 48% at 65 dB SPL compared to the preoperative unaided and best-aided condition, respectively. In summary, DACI provides an effective improvement of the speech perception in noise compared to the best-aided condition in subjects suffering from severe to profound MHL.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2014 S.

N2  - The effect of different stapes prostheses on the basilar membrane (BM) motion was determined. To that end, a three dimensional finite element (FE) model of the passive human cochlea was developed. Passive responses of the BM were found based on coupled fluid-structure interactions between the cochlear solid structures and the scala fluids. The passive BM vibrations in normal (healthy) cochlea were compared with vibrations in the cochlea in which a 0.4-mm piston or a proposed new type of prosthesis was implanted. The proposed chamber prosthesis was not experimentally implanted, but only numerically simulated. Design of the new chamber stapes prosthesis is presented for the first time in this paper. The simulation results showed 10-20 dB decrease in BM displacement amplitude in the case of the piston. In contrast, the BM responses in the cochlea with the new prosthesis are higher with respect to the healthy ear. The results obtained in this study are promising for further research to optimize the design of the new chamber stapes prosthesis.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2014 Elsevier B.V.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Post-auricular approach is commonly used in otologic surgery. The objective of this study was to ascertain whether post-auricular approach alters the position of the auricle., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: All patients who underwent post-auricular approach for mastoidectomy or tympanoplasty from October 2010 to June 2012 were enrolled. Measurements of ear prominence at three distinct sites were taken preoperatively, and postoperatively at day one and at three and 12 months. Data were analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA analysis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Nineteen patients were included in the study. Mean age at surgery was 9.05 years; 11 were male and 8 were female. Overall, there was no statistically significant long-term postoperative change in any of the three measurements, indicating stability of the auricular position. No difference was also noted on the basis of patient variables., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Post-auricular approach did not alter the position of the external ear in our patient population.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: To evaluate modified coupling techniques of the Vibrant Soundbridge system in patients with mixed and conductive hearing loss and to compare it with conventional vibroplasty., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Two different groups were evaluated: 1) nine cases of conventional incus vibroplasty in comparison with 2) nine patients with modified coupling of the floating mass transducer. In the modified coupling approach, the vibrant floating mass transducer was attached to 1) the stapes/oval window, 2) the round window, or 3) the drilled promontory bone (promontory fenestration window). In three patients, an additional ossiculoplasty was performed. Preoperative and postoperative aided and unaided pure-tone and free-field audiometry and Freiburg monosyllabic word test were used to assess hearing outcome., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Functional hearing gain obtained in patients with mixed and conductive hearing loss who underwent modified coupling was 39 dB. Patients with pure sensorineural hearing loss who received conventional incus coupling showed a functional hearing gain of 25 dB. Average functional gain was 41 dB in the oval window group, 45 dB in the round window group, and 30 dB in the promontory fenestration window group. Word recognition test revealed an average improvement of 51% and 21% in the modified and in the conventional approach, respectively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Modified vibroplasty is a safe and effective treatment for patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss. Coupling the floating mass transducer to the promontory bone (promontory fenestration window) is a viable option in chronically disabled ears if oval and round window coupling is not possible., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 4.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2013 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To raise awareness of the potential hazard of auricular burns associated with operating microscope use during otologic surgery., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective case series and summary of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database of voluntary adverse event reports pertaining to microscope related auricular thermal injuries., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND SETTING</ovid:b>: All patients who sustained auricular burns while using the operating microscope during otologic surgery at 2 tertiary academic referral centers., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Surgical procedure, microscope model, intensity of illumination, length of procedure, focal length, location and severity of burn, and patient outcome., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 4 microscope-related auricular thermal injuries were identified from the authors' institutions. Additionally, 82 unique cases of soft tissue burns associated with the use of an operative microscope have been voluntarily reported to the FDA since 2004. A disproportionately large percent (~ 30%) of these occurred within the field of otology, the majority of which were during tympanoplasty or tympanomastoidectomy procedures at focal length distances of 300 mm or less with xenon light source microscopes., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Simultaneous advancements in light delivery technologies and lens optics have continued to improve the efficiency of the operating microscope; however, these improvements also increase the potential for thermal injuries. Although rare, a review of the FDA MAUDE database suggests that microscope-related soft tissue burns occur more frequently in otology than any other surgical specialty. A variety of factors may help explain this finding, including the unique anatomy of the external ear with thin skin and limited underlying adipose tissue. Preventative measures should be taken to decrease the risk of thermal injuries including use of the lowest comfortable light intensity, adjusting the aperture width to match the operative field, frequent wound irrigation, and covering exposed portions of the pinna with a moist surgical sponge.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the concept of bilateral same day tympanoplasty type I (BSDT) in accordance with the principle of evidence based medicine., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A study with control was carried out in a tertiary care setting in a sample size of 60 patients suffering from chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM). The patients were divided into two groups of 30 patients each, group-A comprised of unilateral CSOM cases and group-B comprised of bilateral CSOM cases. All the patients underwent tympanoplasty type I by post auricular inlay technique using temporalis fascia graft. BSDT was done in group-B. Graft and audiological success rates were tabulated and put to statistical examination using Student's 't' test. In addition, post-operative pain was measured by visual analogue scale and statistically analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A graft uptake of 90% and 93% was recorded in group-A and B, respectively. 27 (90%) patients reported an air-bone gap of less than 20 dB post-operatively in group-A and 94% (56 of the operated 60 ears) had an air bone gap less than 20 dB post-operatively in group-B. No case of iatrogenic sensorinueral hearing loss was recorded in this study. Further, pain was not found to be a statistically significant factor detrimental to BSDT., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Bilateral same day tympanoplasty type I is a feasible treatment option in modern otology for a specific group of patients suffering from CSOM.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Twenty-four patients with sensorineural (SNHL), conductive (CHL), and mixed hearing loss (MHL) were implanted with the AMEI Vibrant Soundbridge R (VSB) for medical reasons. All patients were previously rehabilitated with conventional hearing aids. Multiple validated quality of life patient questionnaires, Health Utilities Index (HUI 2 and 3), and Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile (GHABP) were used to determine the utility gain and quality adjusted life years (QALY). Directly related treatment costs for the implantation were calculated and related to utility gain and QALY., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The cost/QALY for patients with SNHL was estimated at 7260/QALY, and for patients with C/MHL at 12 503/QALY.

N2  - <ovid:b>UNLABELLED</ovid:b>: The objectives of the study were to review the results of an active middle ear implant for sensorineural hearing loss in patients who were unable to wear or did not benefit from conventional hearing aids in comparison to patients with a matched degree of hearing loss successfully fitted with a conventional hearing aid. A retrospective chart review of 10 patients (10 ears) after implantation of an active middle ear implant and 12 patients (13 ears) with conventional hearing aids in one tertiary referral center was performed. Intervention for sensorineural hearing loss was the implantation of an active middle ear implant in one group or fitting of conventional hearing aids in the other group. Outcome measures were pure-tone audiometry (auditory thresholds, functional gain), speech audiometry (Freiburg Monosyllabic Test in quiet and in noise) and a quality-of-life questionnaire (Glasgow Benefit Inventory). Average functional gain was 25.2 +/- 8.6 and 14.6 +/- 10.8 dB, speech recognition score in noise was 36.6 +/- 18.4 and 31.2 +/- 19.2 % and in quiet was 66.0 +/- 23.2 and 61.5 +/- 23.8 %, Glasgow Benefit Inventory total score was 38.3 +/- 32.3 and 24.8 +/- 22.2 in patients with active middle ear implants and conventional hearing aids, respectively. In two patient groups matched for degree of sensorineural hearing loss, active middle ear implants provided comparable speech recognition and superior functional gain and quality of life compared to conventional hearing aids., <ovid:b>LEVEL OF EVIDENCE</ovid:b>: 4.

N2  - The objective of this paper is to evaluate and compare hearing outcomes, intraoperative and postoperative complications and tinnitus characteristics, with particular regard to the effects of stapes surgery on the course of tinnitus. Two groups were evaluated: one group of patients were treated with classical stapedotomy and the second group was composed of patients who underwent reversal technique. Eighty-four patients aged between 22 and 62 years with otosclerosis were divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 49, 17 male, mean age 38, patients treated with classic stapedotomy) and group 2 (n = 35, 13 male, mean age 40, patients treated with reversal stapedotomy). Classical and reversal stapedotomy techniques were performed using CO2 laser; self-crimping titanium piston prosthesis were positioned in patients treated with reversal stapedotomy and classical stapedotomy. Preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluation using pure tone audiometry (air-bone gap (ABG), bone-conduction thresholds and air-conduction thresholds). Tinnitus handicap inventory (THI) scale and intraoperative/postoperative complications were assessed in both groups. Wilcoxon's test and Friedman's test followed by post hoc analysis were used. There were no statistically significant differences in ABG, air conduction, bone conduction, and THI score variations after surgery between the two groups. Complications in both groups were not significant, and different. In conclusion, reversal and classic stapedotomies performed with CO2 laser can be considered efficient, safe and reliable techniques considering the hearing outcomes and complications recorded.

N2  - The objective of our study was to review retrospectively the clinical, radiological and therapeutic findings in 62 adults with acute mastoiditis treated at the ENT Department of Ferrara from 1992 to 2010. 62 adult cases fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: otoscopical evidence of co-existent or recent otitis media; postauricular swelling, erythema or tenderness; protrusion of the auricle; fever and/or significant radiological findings of mastoiditis. Conservative treatment comprehended antibiotic +/- ventilation tube. Surgical procedures comprehended mastoidectomy or mastoido-tympanoplasty. The incidence of adult's mastoiditis in our district (0.99 cases/year/100.000 inhabitants) has maintained quite stable during the considered 19-year period. The typical clinical presentation was observed in 48% of cases. Complications were meningitis (15 cases), meningo-encephalitis (1), meningitis associated with lateral sinus thrombosis (1), facial nerve paralysis (11), and labyrinthitis (8). In all cases except one, the facial palsy recovered completely and no mortality was observed due to these complications. Complete cure was obtained with conservative treatment in 69% of uncomplicated cases and in 24% of patients with intracranial complications. Mastoiditis in adults may present as the acute classical form, as well as latent forms which often have prolonged and insidious development followed by a rapid clinical deterioration. Clinical features are frequently atypical, while incidence of meningitis and other complications is still high particularly in the most elderly. Thus, great care is required from clinicians to make an early diagnosis in order to promote adequate treatment.

N2  - Magnesium alloys have been investigated in different fields of medicine and represent a promising biomaterial for implants due to characteristics like bioabsorbability and osteoinduction. The objective of this study was to evaluate the usability of magnesium as implant material in middle ear surgery. Magnesium implants were placed into the right middle ear of eighteen New Zealand White rabbits. Nine animals were euthanized after four weeks and nine animals after three month. The petrous bones were removed and embedded in epoxy resin. The specimens were then polished, stained and evaluated with the aid of a light microscope. The histological examination revealed a good biocompatibility. After four weeks, a beginning corrosion of the implant's surface and low amount of trabecular bone formation in the area of the stapes base plate was observed. A considerable degradation of implants and obvious bone formation was found three month after implantation. The magnesium alloy used in the present study partly corroded too fast, so that a complete bone reconstruction could not be established in time. The increased osteoinduction on the stapes base plate resulted in a tight bone-implant bonding. Thus, a promising application of magnesium could be a coating of biomaterials in order to improve the bony integration of implants.

N2  - The objective of the present work was to estimate the functional outcome of ossiculoplasty in the patients presenting with chronic suppurative otitis media and treated by means of laser beam welding of biological tissues. In order to obtain a good functional result of tympanoplasty including ossiculoplasty, it is necessary to conserve the elements of the sound-conducting system in the positions to which they were set during surgery. We reached this goal by fixing individual elements of the chain of the auditory ossicles by means of the laser beam welding of biological tissues with the use of platelet-rich plasma as a solder alloy. The audiometric examination of the patients within 1, 3, and 12 months after surgery showed that this technique improves the functional outcome of the treatment of the patients with chronic suppurative otitis media using prostheses for the substitution of the auditory ossicles.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To study the effectiveness of tympanoplasty for treatment of chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma in children., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: Twenty-three cases with chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma treated by tympanoplasty were retrospectively studied, among which 15 cases had complete clinical data. The condition of surgical cavities, the duration of getting dry ears, the hearing improvements, the growth of new ear drums and whether the recurrence of cholesteatomas occurred or not were observed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In all patients, the chief complains were ear discharging and hearing loss. The tympanum membranes(pars flaccid or pars tensa) became retracted or perforated and CT scan showed mastoid processes were poor developed in some cases with lesions mainly located at attic, middle tympanum cavity and/or petrous parts. The duration of getting dry ear was (6.0 +/- 1.5) weeks after surgery. The effective rate was 80%. The hearing of 12 cases has been improved, that of 2 cases has no changed, that of 1 case has been descended, and 1 case exhibited recurrent cholesteatoma after surgery., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study demonstrated that children's chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma have their own clinic features of wide erosiveness and strong aggressiveness, and tympanoplasty has been proved to treat this disease effectively, also been proved to improve these patients' hearing cognitions and eventually improve their life qualities.

N2  - The displacement of prostheses of auditory ossicles at the concluding stage of surgery and in the early postoperative period is one of the factors influencing the functional outcome of stapedoplasty. The objective of the present experimental study was to estimate the effectiveness of the use of platelet-rich plasma as an alloy for the laser welding in order to improve fixation of titanium prostheses employed in ossiculoplastic surgery. The results of a series of experiments undertaken to assess the possibility of stabilization of titanium prostheses in the desired position with the help of laser welding indicate that this technique with the use of platelet-rich plasma as an alloy may be a reliable method for the fixation of the reconstructed chain of ossicles in the desired position.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This clinical study was performed to retrospectively analyze the hearing improvement of patients with otosclerosis who underwent stapesplasty with a novel nitinol prosthesis in comparison with the use of already established prostheses (titanium and clip prostheses) and to evaluate the suitability of the nitinol prosthesis for ear surgeons with limited experience in otosclerosis surgery., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective data analysis., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Sixty patients who underwent otosclerosis surgery between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2012, in the ENT department of the University of Munich. Two patients were operated on both sides. For four patients, the stapesplasty was a revision surgery., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Sixty-two procedures of otosclerosis surgery were performed by 6 ear surgeons, one of whom with profound experience in stapesplasty., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: 1) Postoperative air-bone gap, determined for all surgeons together as well as itemized for the experienced and the nonexperienced stapes surgeons; 2) closure of the air-bone gap in 10 dB bins; and 3) change of high-tone bone-conduction level., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Pure-tone audiometry documented less postoperative air-bone gap and a higher percentage of air-bone gap closure when using the nitinol prosthesis, especially in comparison with the clip prosthesis. Also, nonexperienced stapes surgeons received better audiometric results when using the novel nitinol prosthesis., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Clinical evaluation suggests the novel nitinol prosthesis to be a promising tool in otosclerosis surgery for experienced stapes surgeons as well as for ear surgeons with limited experience in stapes surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>IMPORTANCE</ovid:b>: Satisfactory functional results following ossicular chain reconstruction mainly depend on a stable connection between the tympanic membrane and the stapes, which is in turn dependent on the type of prosthesis used. Knowledge about the safety and functional outcome of the commercially available middle ear prostheses is therefore of great importance., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Kurz TTP-Variac System partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) in ossiculoplasty., <ovid:b>DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS</ovid:b>: Retrospective review of all ossiculoplasties performed by 1 surgeon at a secondary referral center from August 2006 through July 2012. Participants were patients with cholesteatoma, chronic otitis media, or ossicular chain disruption in the absence of inflammatory disease who underwent ossicular reconstruction. EXPOSURE Ossiculoplasty using a Kurz TTP-Variac System PORP., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES</ovid:b>: Mean preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps (ABGs) and improvements in ABG were analyzed for each frequency by means of a 4-frequency pure-tone average. Successful postoperative hearing was defined as postoperative ABG smaller than 20 dB., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Eighty-nine ears in 83 patients aged 7 to 85 years were included. Transmeatal tympanoplasty was performed in 17 ears (19%). Seven ears (8%) underwent tympanoplasty with canal wall-down mastoidectomy, and 65 ears (73%) underwent canal wall-up (combined approach) tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy. The study population comprised 61 primary tympanoplasties (69%) and 28 revision cases (31%). Mean follow-up was 13 months. Overall, the ABG significantly improved from a mean (SD; range) of 26.19 (11.53; 3.75-51.25) dB to 15.58 (9.80; 0-48.75) dB (P < .01 for all frequencies). Mean ABG improvement was 10.62 dB. Successful postoperative hearing was obtained in 65 ears (73%). Revision surgery, especially in ears with ossicular chain disruption without inflammatory disease, was associated with poorer functional outcome, whereas preservation of the malleus was associated with a better functional outcome (P < .05). There were few complications (1 prosthesis extrusion, 2 prosthesis dislocations, 2 reperforations, 3 cases of residual cholesteatoma, and 3 of light sensorineural hearing loss)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE</ovid:b>: The titanium Kurz TTP-Variac System PORP is an effective prosthesis to reconstruct the ossicular chain. Complications are rare, illustrating the safety of the prosthesis.

N2  - Surgery on the temporal bone is technically challenging due to its complex anatomy. Precise anatomical dissection of the human temporal bone is essential and is fundamental for middle ear surgery. We assessed the possible application of a virtual reality temporal bone surgery simulator to the education of ear surgeons. Seventeen ENT physicians with different levels of surgical training and 20 medical students performed an antrotomy with a computer-based virtual temporal bone surgery simulator. The ease, accuracy and timing of the simulated temporal bone surgery were assessed using the automatic assessment software provided by the simulator device and additionally with a modified Final Product Analysis Scale. Trained ENT surgeons, physicians without temporal bone surgical training and medical students were all able to perform the antrotomy. However, the highly trained ENT surgeons were able to complete the surgery in approximately half the time, with better handling and accuracy as assessed by the significant reduction in injury to important middle ear structures. Trained ENT surgeons achieved significantly higher scores using both dissection analysis methods. Surprisingly, there were no significant differences in the results between medical students and physicians without experience in ear surgery. The virtual temporal bone training system can stratify users of known levels of experience. This system can be used not only to improve the surgical skills of trained ENT surgeons for more successful and injury-free surgeries, but also to train inexperienced physicians/medical students in developing their surgical skills for the ear.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: To identify the optimum and safe location histologically for drilling and fenestration on promontory inferior to the oval window in stapedectomy. The value of application of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scanning and multiple-planar reconstruction (MPR) for this purpose is also assessed., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: By means of histologic sections and HRCT scanning and MPR for coronal image, measurements were conducted on 3 perpendicular planes in temporal bone sections through the anterior, posterior, and midpoint of the inferior margin of the oval window, respectively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The promontory bone inferior to the posterior portion of the oval window is thickest, which has an average thickness of about 1.1 mm. The endosteum of the basal turn here is deepest under the promontory, which has an average height of about 0.2 mm above the plane of footplate, whereas the distance between the inferior margin of the oval window and the endosteum here is no more than 0.3 mm. The coincidence rate of the measurements by HRCT and histology is up to 90.5%., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Relatively safe location for bone of the promontory removal should be restricted in the posterior portion inferior to the oval window, and the burr should be lifted laterally while drilling. Preoperative HRCT scanning and MPR for coronal image would offer a valuable reference to estimate the safe area for bone of the promontory removal in stapedectomy.

N2  - Recent interferences of hemodynamic functions via modified brain neuronal mechanisms have proven to be major causes of dementia and sleeping disorders. In this work, cerebral expression differences of the neuroactive vesicular chromogranin A (CgA) and distinct alpha GABA(A)R subunits were detected in the facultative hibernating hamster. In particular, damaged neuronal fields of hypotensive torpor (TORP) state were correlated to elevated CgA and GABA(A)R alpha1, alpha4 mRNA levels in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (PVN), central amygdalar nucleus (CeA) plus solitary tractus nucleus (NTS). Conversely, few neurodegeneration signals of hypertensive arousal (AROU) state, accounted for mostly lower CgA levels in the same areas. This state also provided increased alpha2-containing sites in amygdala, hippocampal and NTS neurons together with elevated alpha4-containing receptors in the periventricular hypothalamic nucleus (Pe). Interestingly in our hibernating model, CgA appeared to preferentially feature inhibitory neurosignals as indicated by preliminary perfusion of amygdalar sites with its highly specific antihypertensive derived peptide (catestatin) promoting GABA-dependent sIPSCs. Overall, evident neuronal damages plus altered expression capacities of CgA and alpha1-, alpha2-, alpha4-GABA(A)Rs in CeA, Pe, PVN as well as NTS during both hibernating states corroborate for the first time key molecular switching events guaranteeing useful cardiovascular rescuing abilities of neurodegenerative disorders.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Microtia leads to a severe functional and aesthetic handicap. Traditionally, the auricle is often reconstructed with cartilage transplants, which is, however, associated with some partially substantial disadvantages. The authors have instead used implants of porous polyethylene for successful ear reconstruction for years, thus, avoiding some of these disadvantages. A significant benefit for the patient is achieved by simultaneous hearing rehabilitation by the implantation of active middle ear prostheses., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The authors present their surgical concept which allows functional and aesthetic rehabilitation of microtia in children and adolescents in a single operation. In the respective patient collective, audiometric measurements in quiet and noisy environments were conducted pre- and postoperatively, and health-related quality of life was determined using a validated questionnaire., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All patients experienced a substantial hearing gain both in quiet and noisy environments. The evaluation of health-related quality of life showed a significant benefit from the intervention., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Functional and aesthetic rehabilitation of microtia with active middle ear implants and ear reconstruction using porous polyethylene leads to good and reliable long-term results and can increase the health-related quality of life of affected children and adolescents. The main advantage of this concept is the possibility of a single procedure.

The endosteum of basal turn at this portion was lowest, with an average height of 0.2 mm. Furthermore, the shortest distance here between the inferior edge of oval window and the endosteum could be no more than 0.3 mm., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Relatively safe location of drilling on promontory should be selected on promontory inferior to the posterior point of the oval window, with the direction of drilling outward and downward.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To estimate the reliability of the Bone Conduction-HeadBand (BC-HB) test for predicting the postoperative functional outcome of a round-window (RW) vibroplasty., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Within-subject comparison of the functional results of the BC-HB test, which is routinely used for the preoperative evaluation of a bone-conduction transducer, with an active middle ear implant (AMEI) placed onto the round window., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral university hospital center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Seven patients with similar anatomic (absent stapes superstructure) and functional (moderate, mixed hearing loss) sequelae from open tympanoplasty technique., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: All subjects underwent preoperative audiologic assessment with the BC-HB. Subsequently, all subjects underwent surgical placement of an AMEI onto the round window., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: Pure tone and speech audiometry in quiet and noise were assessed. Additionally, evaluation of specific satisfactory targets was performed using the Client Oriented Scale of Improvement., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Pure tone and speech audiometry in quiet established that both devices had very similar performance and provided remarkable improvement compared with the unaided condition. However, high-frequency gain and speech audiometry in noise demonstrated better performance with RW-AMEI., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In patients presenting with mixed hearing loss as a sequela from middle ear surgery, the preoperative BC-HB test may be helpful in predicting the final functional outcome and patient satisfaction with RW-AMEI.

N2  - To investigate whether keratinocytes proliferate in response to epiregulin produced by subepithelial fibroblasts derived from middle ear cholesteatoma. Tissue samples were obtained from patients undergoing tympanoplasty. The quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry were performed to examine epiregulin expression and localization in cholesteatoma tissues and retroauricular skin tissues. Fibroblasts were cultured from cholesteatoma tissues and from normal retroauricular skin. These fibroblasts were used as feeder cells for culture with a human keratinocyte cell line (PHK16-0b). To investigate the role of epiregulin in colony formation by PHK16-0b cells, epiregulin mRNA expression was knocked down in fibroblasts by using short interfering RNA and epiregulin protein was blocked with a neutralizing antibody. Epiregulin mRNA expression was significantly elevated in cholesteatoma tissues compared with that in normal retroauricular skin. Staining for epiregulin was more intense in the epithelial cells and subepithelial fibroblasts of cholesteatoma tissues than in retroauricular skin. When PHK16-0b cells were cultured with cholesteatoma fibroblasts, their colony-forming efficiency was 50% higher than when these cells were cultured with normal skin fibroblasts. Also, knockdown of epiregulin mRNA in cholesteatoma fibroblasts led to greater suppression of colony formation than knockdown in skin fibroblasts. Furthermore, the colony-forming efficiency of PHK16-0b cells was significantly reduced after treatment with an epiregulin neutralizing antibody in co-culture with cholesteatoma fibroblasts, but not in co-culture with skin fibroblasts. These results suggest that keratinocyte hyperproliferation in cholesteatoma is promoted through overexpression of epiregulin by subepithelial fibroblasts via epithelial-mesenchymal interactions, which may play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: According to the literature, between 40 and 90% of otosclerosis patients suffering from hearing loss also suffer from tinnitus on the affected side. For a lot of these patients tinnitus represents a handicap that is just as debilitating as the hearing loss itself. The main goal of the surgical treatment of otosclerosis is a significant improvement in hearing loss, but frequent reports of reduced tinnitus after surgery suggest that this can be a positive side effect., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: All patients who underwent stapedotomy were initially included in the study. Retrospectively, the tinnitus questionnaire as compiled by Goebel and Hiller was sent to the patients, and 34 patients (37 ears) replied. The pre- and postoperative cases of tinnitus were divided into compensated and non-compensated tinnitus. In addition the following tinnitus-related factors were evaluated: emotional, cognitive and mental burden; intrusiveness of the tinnitus; hearing problems; somatic ailments; and sleep disturbances., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Over 80% of the patients surveyed suffered from tinnitus pre-operation. The tinnitus disappeared or improved in over 60% of the cases after stapedotomy. In addition, the related factors surveyed also improved appreciably post surgery and reached a significant level in patients with compensated tinnitus., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Besides a significant improvement in hearing loss the intensity and the psychosomatic burden of a pre-operative tinnitus can be reduced by stapedotomy.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Although attenuation of tube-induced coughing is necessary in specific types of surgery, the best method for such attenuation is still unclear. We studied the combined intervention of endotracheal lidocaine and intravenous remifentanil compared to intravenous remifentanil alone with respect to coughing during emergence from anesthesia., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We examined 60 ASA 1-2 patients (age, 20-69 years) undergoing tympanoplasty under general anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with propofol, remifentanil, and rocuronium. The trachea was intubated using a laryngotracheal instillation of topical anaesthetic (LITA) tracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with propofol and remifentanil (0.1-0.3 mug/kg/min). Propofol was discontinued and remifentanil (0.1 mug/kg/min) was continued at the end of the operation. Patients were randomly allocated to the lidocaine (n = 30) and control groups (n = 30). We administered 3 ml 4 % lidocaine via the LITA tube to patients in lidocaine group at the end of the operation. The trachea was extubated when the patient regained consciousness and followed orders. Coughing was evaluated using a 4-point scale by an observer who examined the video records at extubation., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Fewer patients in lidocaine group (8 of 30) than in control group (18 of 30, p < 0.01) coughed. Fewer patients in lidocaine group (2 of 30) than in control group (12 of 30, p < 0.01) had moderate or severe cough (scale 2 or 3)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: This study is consistent with the finding that endotracheal lidocaine administration and continuous infusion of remifentanil before extubation is useful to prevent coughing on emergence from anesthesia.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To investigate a pathology of conductive hearing loss caused by an incomplete ossicular discontinuity. It can manifest as a triad of the following: 1) conductive hearing loss most prominent in the high frequencies (hfCHL), defined as [ABG for 4 kHz] > [mean ABG for 0.25-0.5 kHz] + 10 dB or more; 2) fluctuating hearing loss; and 3) short-lasting improvement of hearing after Valsalva maneuver., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective clinical trial., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Fourteen patients with an incomplete ossicular discontinuity who underwent incus interposition were included., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Incus interposition, mathematical model., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: First, the prevalence of the triad was documented. Second, the hypothesis that mechanical ossicular compliance was responsible for the triad of symptoms was evaluated and simulated in a mathematical model. Finally, the postoperative hearing results with a follow-up of 12 months were analyzed and compared with those reported in the literature., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The presence of the triad of symptoms is a strong indicator for detecting patients with an incomplete ossicular discontinuity. High frequency conductive hearing loss was present in 93% (13/14 patients). Ten (71%) of the 14 patients presented with fluctuating hearing loss and improvement of hearing after Valsalva maneuver. The hfCHL could be simulated adequately in the mathematical model. Success rate for surgical intervention (ABG < 20 dB; 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz) was 93% and was comparable to the results reported in the literature., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Patients with hfCHL, fluctuating hearing loss, and improvement of hearing after Valsalva maneuver are likely to have an incomplete ossicular discontinuity. A favorable postoperative hearing recovery by incus interposition can be expected.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: The present study was performed to examine the impact of the release rate of ciprofloxacin from prostheses coated with nanoporous silica layers on the outcome of an acute bacterial infection of the middle ear of rabbits., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Middle ear prostheses are often implanted in an infectious environment because of chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma. Bacterial colonization leads to healing disorders after surgery and may lead to the extrusion of the implants. Nanoporous silica layers appear promising as a drug delivery system for antibiotics placed on implants. Before clinical applications can be envisioned, it is necessary to find an optimal release rate., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: White New Zealand rabbits were provided unilaterally with either a "slow release" or a "burst release" ciprofloxacin-containing middle ear Bioverit II prosthesis. After implantation, the middle ears were infected with a solution of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Afterwards, animals were monitored clinically and, after 3 months, sacrificed to perform necropsy and microbiologic examinations., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In the "slow release" group, 7 of 12 animals had to be euthanized preterm because of their poor clinical condition compared with 2 of 12 animals of the "burst release" group (p < 0.05). Clinical and microbiologic examination also showed a better outcome for animals of the burst release group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: A burst release of ciprofloxacin from middle ear implants is important to combat a perioperative infection with Ps. aeruginosa in the middle ear model of the rabbit.

N2  - <ovid:b>AIM</ovid:b>: To provide an easy-to-follow evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for the management of chronic otitis media (COM) in children., <ovid:b>MATERIALS/METHODS</ovid:b>: Literature review and critical analysis of the available evidence in Medline and other scientific database sources., <ovid:b>DATA SYNTHESIS</ovid:b>: Otorrhea and hearing loss are the cardinal symptoms of COM, while oto-microscopy and imaging techniques can confirm the diagnosis. Conservative treatment is acceptable to some extent (i.e. mild cases of COM without cholesteatoma). It involves topical drops (quinolones as first choice drugs- strength of recommendation B), as well as performing aural toilet (strength of recommendation B), and avoiding water ingress. Tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy is expected to improve hearing in cases of non-cholesteatomatous COM (strength of recommendation C), and positively affect the children's quality of life (strength of recommendation B). Less experienced surgeons and inflamed, wet middle ear mucosa represent the two most important factors, which could lead to reperforations (strength of recommendation C). The surgical management of COM with cholesteatoma tends to employ the least invasive surgical technique, in order to obtain a small self-cleaning mastoid cavity, as well as good hearing results (strength of recommendation C)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The treatment of choice in most cases of pediatric COM is surgery. Figure 1 proposes a detailed and easy-to-follow evidence-based algorithm with regard to the diagnosis and management of COM in children.

N2  - In this tutorial review we present the process of the development of functional implants using mesoporous silica. The different steps from chemical synthesis and physicochemical characterization followed by in vitro testing in cell culture assays to clinically relevant in vivo animal studies are examined. Since the end of the 1990s, mesoporous silicas have been considered as biomaterials. Numerous investigations have demonstrated their non-toxic and biocompatible properties. These qualities in combination with the unique properties of high surface area and pore volume, uniform and tunable pore sizes and chemical modifiability are the reasons for the great scientific interest in this field. Here we show that besides bulk materials or mesoporous silica nanoparticles, mesoporous silica films are highly promising as coatings on medical prostheses or implants. We report on the development of functionalized mesoporous silica materials specifically for middle ear applications. Middle ear prostheses are used to restore the sound transmission through this air-filled cavity when the small bones of the middle air (the ossicular chain) have been destroyed by disease or by accidents. In addition to optimal restoration of sound transmission, this technique bears several challenges, e.g. an ongoing bacterial infection or the displacement of the prosthesis due to insufficient fixation. To improve the healing process, a mesoporous silica coating was established on ceramic middle ear prostheses, which then served as a base for further functionalizations. For example, the bone growth factor BMP2 was locally attached to the coating in order to improve the fixation of the prosthesis by forming a bony connection to the remainder of the ear bones. Further, an implant-based local drug delivery system for the antibiotic ciprofloxacin was developed with the aim of fighting bacterial infections. Further possibilities using mesoporous silica nanoparticles as part of a composite on an implant are briefly discussed.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This retrospective, comparative study aimed to assess anatomical and functional results in a group of adults undergoing type I tympanoplasty for subtotal tympanic membrane perforation, using two different types of graft., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The study included 106 patients affected by chronic otitis media, who underwent underlay type I tympanoplasty, 53 using an autologous chondro-perichondral tragal graft and 53 using temporalis fascia. Anatomical and functional outcomes were evaluated over time., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Audiometric results comparing the cartilage and fascia groups at six months and one year after surgery showed no statistically significant differences. Assessment of anatomical outcomes indicated a greater number of complications in the fascia group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Functional results indicate the validity of the cartilage tympanoplasty, while anatomical results indicate a slightly better outcome in terms of graft re-perforation and retraction, compared with temporalis fascia at one-year follow up. These results suggest that the cartilage technique is preferable for type I tympanoplasty.

Univariate statistical tests were used to analyze predictors for air-bone gap (ABG) improvement, complications, and need for resurgery. Population data were used to calculate incidences of middle ear diseases admitted for surgery and annual rates of middle ear surgeries., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: ABG improved after surgery for chronic otitis media without and with cholesteatoma, otosclerosis, trauma cases, or complication after acute otitis media/externa (p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p < 0.0001; p = 0.005; p = 0.004; respectively). Middle ear surgery significantly improved bone conduction in cases of otosclerosis (p = 0.008), sudden deafness (p = 0.006), and acute otitis media/externa with complication (p = 0.004). There was a trend of more complication in patients older than 60 years (p = 0.055). Surgery was indicated for chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma in 17.4/100,000 persons, for cholesteatoma in 15.0/100,000, for otosclerosis in 5.7/100,000, for sudden deafness with suspicion of perilymph fistula in 1.5/100,000, and for trauma with affection of the lateral cranial base and hearing loss or otitis media with complication in 1.3/100,000 habitants, respectively. A cochlear implant was indicated in 1.0/100,000 habitants., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This population based analysis is showing that middle ear surgery is performed country-wide with good results and low risk on important scale in daily routine by ear surgeons.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The aims of the study were to assess hearing-aid uptake in patients with otosclerosis 28-30 years after stapedectomy and to evaluate hearing-aid benefit to users., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: A retrospective study was performed; it included a review of medical records and follow-up 28-30 years after surgery, including audiometry, clinical examination, structured interview, and a validated questionnaire, IOI-HA., <ovid:b>STUDY SAMPLE</ovid:b>: Sixty-five patients, who had undergone stapedectomy at a tertiary referral center in 1977-79., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In 95% of the subjects there was a theoretical need for hearing-aid amplification at follow-up; 46% of the subjects had no hearing aids, while 26% had unilateral and 28% bilateral hearing aids. Hearing sensitivity in the best ear predicted hearing-aid uptake. Of the subjects with a hearing aid, 94% were everyday users and 54% were full-time users (> 8 hours/day). The subjects reported a high level of satisfaction (mean 4.5) and benefit (mean 4.2), but also residual activity limitations (mean 3.1)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The study shows that there is an unmet need for long-term hearing rehabilitation among patients previously undergoing surgery for otosclerosis. The patients who were using hearing aids were generally very satisfied with their hearing aids, but they still reported residual activity limitations.

The questionnaires consisted of a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-10) to score the overall quality of life, and the Operation Benefit Profile to assess the listening capability in various circumstances. Stereophony, defined by the Belfast rule of thumb, was used to divide the patients in 3 categories having unilateral, symmetric bilateral, or asymmetric bilateral hearing loss., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Six patients were considered early failures of surgery, and 8 patients were lost to follow-up. In the remaining 40 patients (43 ears), all audiometric parameters improved significantly. The postoperative air-bone gap was less than 10 dB in 70%. The postoperative average air conduction threshold was less than 30 dB in 49%. The postoperative quality of life was excellent (VAS, >=9) in 45% and did not correlate with any preoperative parameter. Preoperative and postoperative overall listening capabilities correlated slightly (Spearman r, 0.47). The postoperative VAS correlated with all postoperative audiometric parameters and the Operation Benefit Profile., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Uncomplicated stapes surgery itself is the only predictor of improvement in listening capabilities and patient satisfaction 6 months after stapes surgery in otosclerosis.

N2  - The application of computer modelling for medical purposes, although challenging, is a promising pathway for further development in the medical sciences. We present predictive neural and k-nearest neighbour (k-NN) models for hearing improvements after middle ear surgery for chronic otitis media. The studied data set comprised 150 patients characterised by the set of input variables: age, gender, preoperative audiometric results, ear pathology and details of the surgical procedure. The predicted (output) variable was the postoperative hearing threshold. The best neural models developed in this study achieved 84% correct predictions for the test data set while the k-NN model produced only 75.8% correct predictions.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To present the preliminary results of new malleus replacement prosthesis combined with a total ossicular prosthesis in middle ear reconstruction in patients missing the malleus and stapes., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective experimental and nonrandomized clinical study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: An original titanium malleus replacement prosthesis (MRP) was designed to be inserted into the external auditory canal and to replace a missing malleus for various middle ear pathologies. The MRP was tested experimentally and clinically. The vibratory properties of the new prosthesis were measured using laser Doppler vibrometry. Ninety patients with missing malleus and stapes, undergoing 92 ossicular reconstructions were enrolled in this study from September 1994 to March 2012. Comparative analyses were made between a group of 34 cases of ossicular reconstructions with total prosthesis (TORP) positioned from the tympanic membrane to the stapes footplate (TM-to-footplate assembly) and a group of 58 cases of ossicular reconstructions with TORP positioned from a newly designed malleus replacement prosthesis (MRP) to the stapes footplate (MRP-to-footplate assembly). Preoperative and postoperative audiometric evaluation using conventional audiometry, that is, air-bone gap (ABG), bone-conduction thresholds (BC), and air-conduction thresholds (AC) were assessed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Experimentally, the vibratory properties of the MRP are promising and remain very good even when the MRP is cemented into the bony canal wall mimicking its complete osseous-integration, if this were to occur. This finding supports the short-term clinical results as in the TM-to-footplate group; the 3-month postoperative mean ABG was 23.3 dB compared with 12.5 dB in the MRP-to-footplate group (difference, 10.8; 95% confidence interval, 4.0-17.6); 37.0% of patients from the TM-to-footplate group had a postoperative ABG of 10 dB or less, and 48.1% of patients had a postoperative ABG of 20 dB or less, as compared with 58.1% and 79.1%, respectively, in the MRP-to-footplate group. The average gain in AC was 11.0 dB in the TM-to-footplate group as compared with 21.3 dB in the MRP-to-footplate group (difference, -10.3; 95% confidence interval, -18.2 to -2.4)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The results of this study indicate that superior postoperative hearing thresholds could be achieved using a MRP-to-footplate assembly, compared with a TM-to-footplate assembly in patients with an absent malleus undergoing ossiculoplasty. The postoperative AC thresholds, after 3 months and 1 year, are significantly lower in patients treated with the MRP-to-footplate assembly.

N2  - Titanium implants in middle ear surgery were introduced in the late 90s and are now frequently used in middle ear surgery. However, long-term studies of patient outcome are few and have only been published in subgroups of patients. We report the long-term effect of titanium middle ear implants for ossicular reconstruction in chronic ear disease investigated in a Norwegian tertiary otological referral centre. Retrospective chart reviews were performed for procedures involving 76 titanium implants between 2000 and 2007. All patients who underwent surgery using the Kurz Vario titanium implant were included in the study. Audiological parameters using four frequencies, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3 kHz, according to AAO-HNS guidelines, was assessed pre and postoperatively. Otosurgical procedures, complications, revisions, and extrusion rates were analyzed. The study had no dropouts. The partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) was used in 44 procedures and the total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) in 32 procedures, respectively. Mean follow-up was 5.2 years (62 months). The ossiculoplasties were performed as staging procedures or in combination with other chronic ear surgery. The same surgeon performed all the procedures. A postoperative air-bone gap of <= 20 dB was obtained in 74 % of the patients, 82 % for the Bell (PORP) prosthesis, and 63 % for the Arial (TORP) prosthesis. The extrusion rate was 5 %. We conclude that titanium ossicular implants give stable and excellent long-term hearing results.

N2  - Reconstruction of the external auditory canal (EAC) after resection of carcinoma has become widely performed in combination with tympanoplasty to retain hearing ability, thus improving quality of life. Although skin grafting has been commonly performed, stenosis, infection and delayed wound healing often occur postoperatively. Local flaps can cause less stenosis, but the size and mobility are limited. For preventing stenosis and osteoradionecrosis after postoperative radiation, super-thin as well as durable resurfacing is required. We present two cases of reconstruction of the EAC using a super-thin free superficial circumflex iliac perforator (SCIP) flap. The flap was elevated as a super-thin flap primarily and inset into the defect as a tube. The flap survived completely without stenosis, infection or osteoradionecrosis even after postoperative radiation therapy. As this flap can securely cover the important structures, causes less stenosis and can endure postoperative radiation therapy, we believe that this method could be an option for reconstruction after resection of EAC cancers.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2012 British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

N2  - Epstein syndrome is a rare disease which is accompanied by nephritis, sensorineural hearing impairment and macrothrombocytopenia. It has been suggested that this syndrome is a hereditary disease associated with mutations in MYH9, which encodes non-muscle myosin heavy chain IIA. We report a case of a patient with Epstein syndrome in whom bilateral profound hearing impairment developed and who had undergone cochlear implantation 9 years previously. Prior to this, the patient showed progressive sensorineural hearing impairment and had become completely deaf by the age of 25. A cochlear implant was successfully used with a speech discrimination score of 98% (sentence test). However, in the present case, peri- and postoperative complications occurred: tympanic perforation remained after a promontory stimulation test, followed by transitory otitis with purulent discharge. Therefore, tympanoplasty was performed simultaneously with cochlear implantation. These complications were considered to be caused by platelet dysfunction and delayed wound healing. Furthermore, cochlear destruction was observed 8 years postoperatively. In Epstein syndrome, the mechanism of osseous change remains uncertain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of Epstein syndrome in a patient with long-term use of a CI.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the anti-adhesive and anti-inflammatory effects of sodium hyaluronate-carboxymethylcellulose (HA-CMC) in reducing postoperative pain after temporalis fascia harvest during tympanomastoid surgery., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Between January and December 2009, 27 patients underwent tympanoplasty and open cavity mastoidectomy involving the harvesting of temporalis fasciae (more than 3x4cm). At the end of surgery, patients were injected with 1.5g HA-CMC or normal saline around the fascia harvest area. Beginning immediately postoperatively and for 2 months after surgery, patients scored their pain in the temporal area on a visual analogue scale (VAS)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There were no significant postoperative complications, such as bleeding or hematoma, in either control group. VAS scores of both groups decreased over time and were negligible after 2 months. VAS scores of the HA-CMC and control groups differed significantly (p<0.001 by repeated measures ANOVA for all VAS scores)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: HA-CMC can decrease immediate postoperative pain arising from tissue adhesion and inflammation, thus reducing postoperative mastication pain.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) continues to be an important public health problem despite significant advances in medical science. Ear discharge, pain, discomfort, difficulty in hearing, limitation of routine activities and emotional problems due to CSOM cause a significant impact on the health and general well being of the patient. We have done Type 1 tympanoplasty in tubotympanic type of COM to reconstruct the tympanic membrane and alleviate the symptoms of the patients. This study presents an analysis of the impact of the surgery on the patient subjectively and its correlation with objective outcomes. 45 patients were selected to fill the chronic otitis media-5 (COM-5) questionnaire and underwent pure tone audiometry preoperatively. All the patients underwent Type 1 tympanoplasty by using temporalis fascia graft. The status of the ossicles was checked and documented intraoperatively. Patients requiring ossicular reconstruction or with attico antral disease were excluded. Patients were followed up for a period of 6 months and those with an intact graft after 6 months were included in the study. These patients were again made to fill the questionnaire and undergo pure tone audiometry postoperatively. 37 out of 45 patients (82 %) had an intact graft 6 months after surgery. Marked improvement was observed in subjective scores as documented by the questionnaire, pre- and postoperatively with the mean improvement in total scores being 7.89 +/- 4.81 on a Visual Analogue Scale. Also significant improvement was achieved in closure of air-bone gap with the mean improvement being 14.73 +/- 8.58 dB. Significant correlation was found between subjective and objective scores in most patients. This study showed that Type 1 tympanoplasty brings about a significant improvement in the quality of life of chronic suppurative otitis media patients. Most patients showed a marked improvement in subjective scores which correlated well with the objective findings of the status of the graft and improvement in air-bone gap. Asymptomatic patients with less preoperative scores showed less improvement in subjective scores which did not correlate with the objective outcomes.

N2  - Congenital middle ear malformations are rare. Most part of them are usually associated with other malformations, such as aural atresia, microtia, and dysmorphic craniofacial features. A clinical case of a 24-year-old male with a right-sided conductive hearing loss since his childhood, without craniofacial malformation, is presented. He was proposed for exploratory tympanotomy under the suspicious diagnosis of otosclerosis. The surgery revealed an abnormal location of stapes' superstructure, which was attached to the promontory and had an isolated and mobile osseous footplate in the oval window. A stapes prosthesis was inserted and resulted in closure of the air-bone gap by 25 dB. A review of the literature was also performed using MEDLINE. Two theories diverge on the embryologic origin of the stapes. Our findings seem to be in favour of the theory that defines two different embryologic origins to the stapes.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Chronic otitis media (COM) can be treated with tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy. In patients who have undergone middle ear surgery, three-dimensional spiral computed tomography (CT) scan plays an important role in optimizing surgical planning., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This study was performed to compare the findings of three-dimensional reconstructed spiral and conventional CT scan of ossicular chain study in patients with COM., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Fifty patients enrolled in the study underwent plane and three dimensional CT scan (PHILIPS-MX 8000). Ossicles changes, mastoid cavity, tympanic cavity, and presence of cholesteatoma were evaluated. Results of the two methods were then compared and interpreted by a radiologist, recorded in questionnaires, and analyzed. Logistic regression test and Kappa coefficient of agreement were used for statistical analyses., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixty two ears with COM were found in physical examination. A significant difference was observed between the findings of the two methods in ossicle erosion (11.3% in conventional CT vs. 37.1% in spiral CT, P = 0.0001), decrease of mastoid air cells (82.3% in conventional CT vs. 93.5% in spiral CT, P = 0.001), and tympanic cavity opacity (12.9% in conventional CT vs. 40.3% in spiral CT, P=0.0001). No significant difference was observed between the findings of the two methods in ossicle destruction (6.5% conventional CT vs. 56.4% in spiral CT, P = 0.125), and presence of cholesteatoma (3.2% in conventional CT vs. 42% in spiral CT, P = 0.172). In this study, spiral CT scan demonstrated ossicle dislocation in 9.6%, decrease of mastoid air cells in 4.8%, and decrease of volume in the tympanic cavity in 1.6%; whereas, none of these findings were reported in the patients' conventional CT scans., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Spiral-CT scan is superior to conventional CT in the diagnosis of lesions in COM before operation. It can be used for detailed evaluation of ossicular chain in such patients.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION AND AIM</ovid:b>: Middle ear surgeries can be performed under local anesthesia and sedation and can be well tolerated by the patient with minimal discomfort. This study was undertaken to compare two techniques of conscious sedation, intravenous midazolam, and propofol infusion for tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Forty patients scheduled for right or left tympanoplasty. American Society of Anesthesiologists I or II in age group 18-75 years were included in the study. The patients were randomly allocated into one of the two groups to receive either propofol (group I) or midazolam (group II)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The mean duration of anesthesia was 116.00 +/- 33.94 min in group I, while 97.50 +/- 30.76 min in group II (P = 0.07). The modified Ramsay sedation scale was not statistically significant in both the groups. In group I, 70% of the patients and 95% of the patients in group II had amnesia during the surgery (P = 0.091). The mean visual analog scale (VAS) score for surgeons and patients was not statistically significant in both the groups. In group I there was a positive correlation between the total dose of fentanyl and VAS score for surgeons (P = 0.02). There was also a positive correlation between the total dose of propofol and VAS score for surgeons (P = 0.034) and patients (P = 0.039) in group I., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Though propofol had shown a faster recovery and less nausea vomiting, we need a larger sample size to conclude, which of the technique is better. Both the techniques are safe, simple and versatile and provide excellent sedation with rapid trouble free recovery.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after middle ear surgery is high. In this study we want to compare the effects of intravenous granisetron and oral gabapentin as a premedication before surgery on the incidence and severity of PONV after middle ear surgery in adult patents., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: We enrolled 90 patients that were randomly divided into the three groups of 30 in each. Group I received granisetron 3 mg iv 2 minutes before induction of anesthesia; Group II received oral gabapentin 300 mg 1 hour before anesthesia and Group III received placebo. The incidence and severity of PONV were recorded each 15 minutes in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) and each 8 hours until 24 hours after discharge from the PACU., <ovid:b>RESULT</ovid:b>: The incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting at different time intervals in Groups I and Group II was significantly lower compared with Group III (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of side effects of study drug administration including respiratory depression, apnea, extra pyramidal disorders, drowsiness, dizziness, vertigo and headache in three groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The study was shown that using gabapentin and granisetron have equal anti-emetic effects, but significant differences were seen between these two groups compared to the control group. These submit the efficiency of these drugs in preventing PONV.

N2  - <ovid:b>AIM</ovid:b>: The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness, hemodynamic changes and duration of sedation and analgesia between combinations of fortwin-phenergan-midazolam (FPM) and ketamine - midazolam (KM) along with local anesthesia for the surgeries done under the umbrella of monitored anesthesia care., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A total of 50 patients undergoing surgeries as tympanoplasty, septoplasty, lip repair, dacrocystectomy and cataract under local anesthesia, randomly received either intravenous (IV) fortwin 0.3 mg/kg over 1 min followed by IV midazolam 0.04 mg/kg plus IV phenergan 12.5 mg (Group FPM) or IV ketamine 0.3 mg/kg over 1 min plus IV midazolam 0.04 mg/kg (Group KM). Sedation was titrated to Ramsay sedation score (RSS) of 3. Patients' mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), saturation peripheral pulse, duration of sedation and need for intraoperative rescue sedation/analgesic were recorded and compared. Satisfaction of patients (using a 1-7 point Likert verbal rating scale) and readiness for discharge towards (time to Aldrete score of 10) were also determined., <ovid:b>RESULT</ovid:b>: Group KM had significant rise in HR (20-25%) and MAP (25-30%) from 30 min after the bolus dose given until the end of the surgery in contrast to Group FPM. The target sedation level (RSS >= 3) was higher in Group FPM (n = 23 [92%]) as compared with Group KM (n = 12 [48%]). Time until need for rescue sedation was 66.96 +/- 17.19 min in FPM and 32.80 +/- 8.90 min in KM group. The patient satisfaction (Likert scale) is more with the FPM group (6.12 +/- 0.83 vs. 4.40 +/- 1.20)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: We found that the combination of FPM is superior to the KM combination as per the hemodynamic changes, duration of analgesia, patients' satisfaction and efficacy of the drugs are concerned.

T1  - Characteristics of wideband acoustic immittance in patients with middle-ear dysfunction.
DO  - https://dx.doi.org/10.3766/jaaa.25.5.2

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Wideband acoustic immittance (WAI) measurements are a relatively new class of aural acoustic tests that have shown promise as useful tools for evaluating middle-ear status. A growing body of work has described WAI for infants, children, and adults with normal middle-ear function, but a relatively limited number of studies have investigated the influence of specific middle-ear disorders on WAI. Although emerging WAI research data show promising results, additional measurements from ears of patients with a variety of middle-ear disorders are needed., <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: The aims of the present study were to (1) obtain WAI data from patients with a variety of middle-ear conditions, (2) examine relationships between WAI data relative to standard audiometric tests, and (3) identify patterns or profiles in WAI data within and among patients with different middle-ear conditions., <ovid:b>RESEARCH DESIGN</ovid:b>: A descriptive study., <ovid:b>STUDY SAMPLE</ovid:b>: Participants included 30 children and two adults with a variety of middle-ear disorders who were recruited from clinical audiology settings., <ovid:b>DATA COLLECTION/ANALYSIS</ovid:b>: Experimental ambient and tympanometric WAI data were gathered along with standard audiometric test data as part of clinical audiology appointments. Single-subject and small-group data sets for ears of patients with suspected otitis media with effusion (sOME), pressure equalization (PE) tubes, negative tympanometric peak pressure (TPP), tympanoplasty, and cerumen impaction were obtained. Qualitative analysis and descriptive statistics (means and percentiles) were used to characterize the data., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Group mean absorbance for ears in the sOME group was reduced across the majority of frequencies; absorbance for ears with negative TPP was also reduced, although to a lesser degree. Absorbance patterns for ears with PE tubes show even greater differences because of the effects of the tube and open middle-ear cavity. WAI from ears with a tympanoplasty and cerumen impaction was suggestive of middle-ear dysfunction in the presence of normal single-frequency tympanometry. Percentile (5th, 50th, and 95th) plots for absorbance and other WAI quantities of admittance level, admittance phase, and equivalent ear-canal volume calculated for the sOME, negative TPP, and PE tube groups showed distinctive profiles that might be useful for discrimination of different middle-ear pathologies. Quantities from wideband tympanometry, including 250- and 1000-Hz single-frequency admittance tympanometric data were also derived., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: WAI measurements for some middle-ear conditions were consistent with patterns and profiles previously reported in the literature. WAI profiles for other middle-ear conditions, which had not been previously reported in the literature, were presented. Relationships between WAI data and results of standard audiometric tests were generally consistent with expectations. However, in some cases, WAI measurements were suggestive of middle-ear dysfunction despite normal 226-Hz admittance tympanometric findings.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright American Academy of Audiology.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Endoscopic-assisted microsurgery of the middle ear enables the field of view of the surgeon to be expanded during the removal of inflammatory tissue from the tympanic cavity and during myringo- and ossiculoplasty. Canal wall up tympanoplasty with posterior tympanotomy is a gold standard in surgical treatment of chronic otitis media. Most applications of endoscopy in middle ear surgery concern exclusively the endoscopic transcanal approach., <ovid:b>AIM</ovid:b>: To determine the usefulness of endoscopic visualization during the standard surgical approach through the posterior tympanotomy., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The study compared the visualization of the elements of the middle ear through the posterior tympanotomy by endoscopes with 30degree and 45degree optics and a microscope. Posterior tympanotomy was performed in eleven temporal bones. Visualization of the tympanic recesses was assessed on a subjective scale. A microscope and 30degree and 45degree endoscopes were used for inspection of the hypotympanum, sinus tympani, Eustachian tube, Prussak's space and footplate. Friedman ANOVA test and Dunn's multiple comparisons test were used for statistical analysis of the data., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Visualization of particular recesses by endoscopes, both 30degree and 45degree, was excellent, while the microscopic view was statistically significantly worse, especially for sinus tympani, Prussak's space and footplate. There were no significant differences in visibility of the middle ear spaces between the two types of endoscopic optics., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Additional application of the endoscopes during middle ear surgery provides valuable information due to excellent visualization of key recesses usually hidden from the microscope.

N2  - <ovid:b>UNLABELLED</ovid:b>: To analyze the results of repair defect of the ear canal with autologous bone containing periosteum and hearing reconstruction and postoperative inflation. Retrospective analysis of the 40 cases of surgeries conducted by senior surgeon. All cases received full open surgeries. Preoperative air conduction (AC) was 67.47 +/- 14.32 dBHL, and GAP was 45.95 +/- 12.63 dBHL. These cases were divided into two groups: the first 20 ears received repair surgery for radical mastoid cavity with bone slice containing periosteum combined with ear ossicle remodeling, namely the bone slice group. For another 20 ears, inflator was additionally used and the mastoid antrum cavity was inflated twice a day, namely the inflation group., <ovid:b>FOLLOW-UP</ovid:b>: 9-60 months (median follow-up of 26 months)., <ovid:b>STATISTICAL ANALYSIS</ovid:b>: U test was adopted. All ear canal showed a smooth appearance. Eight cases received CT scans and presenting re-gasification of attic and/or mastoid cavity. Hearing: AC of 47.32 +/- 15.63 dBHL, and GAP of 18.28 +/- 15.28 dBHL, both P values were <0.01 as compared with that before operation, and the difference was highly significant. 23 cases showed GAP <20 dB, and one case showed GAP >20 at follow-up, but narrowing was >30 dB, and these 24 cases were successful case, with a success rate = 60 %. 16 cases with GAP <10 dB, although 4 cases with GAP >10 dB, narrowing was >30 dB, thus the 20 cases were markedly effective, and with ratio = 50 %. The gap of 30 cases was narrowed more than 15 dB, although two cases showed gap narrowing less than 15 dB, postoperative GAP was less than 10 dB, both were valid, with an efficacy of 32/40 = 80 %, 18 cases (45 %) with AC <40 dBHL. Sub-group analysis: age: group P < 0.05 when the two groups were compared, difference in ages of the two groups were significant, and the age of the inflation group was older. Both GAP and AC of the two groups showed no significant difference before and after the surgery. One case in the bone slice group showed poor postoperative hearing, adhesion was found between the mesotympanum and attic in reoperation, and best result of GAP Close to less than 10 dB was obtained using the decomposition method after inflation. Bone slice containing periosteum can be used for reconstruct the normal ear canal. Auxiliary inflation of middle ear can even promote the tympanic re-gasification and hearing recovery.

N2  - The value of high-resolution CT scanning in diagnosing stapedial otosclerosis and in influencing surgical planning was studied. 40 cases, consisting of patients of both genders, above the age of 14 years, with a clinical diagnosis of otosclerosis underwent HRCT of the temporal bones. Images were acquired in axial plane, with a bone algorithm, keeping slice thickness at 0.5 mm and intervals of 0.5 mm. Reconstruction of the volume data set was done to obtain overlapping slices in various planes, so as to obtain the best possible images of the footplate of stapes. The thickness of the footplate was measured and the site of lesion was noted in these images. On exploratory tympanotomy, the footplate was assessed and graded according to a visual scale. HRCT was able to diagnose stapedial otosclerosis in 85% ears. It was able to identify the presence of a thickened footplate correctly with a sensitivity of 85.3% (P value 0.16). It was able to correctly localize the site of otosclerotic focus in 85% cases (P value <0.01). Thus, an estimate of the thickness of the footplate likely to be encountered and thus the amount of drilling likely to be required to create a fenestra; and the likely site of maximum thickness could be made pre-operatively. This study also established the value of multislice CT on the acquisition of such data. This method obviates the requirement of difficult patient positioning, reduces scanning time; while greatly improving the sensitivity of the scanning.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Although the prevalence of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is much higher in developing counties, most surgical treatment techniques are not easily accessible in many poor resource countries., <ovid:b>AIM</ovid:b>: The survey aims to examine the extent to which health care facilities in Nigeria are equipped to address the management challenges of CSOM., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Online questionnaires were sent and received from otolaryngologists practicing in across Nigerian public health institutions to evaluate the institutional practice concerning management of CSOM. Information enquired include: Proportion of CSOM among the ear, nose and throat (ENT) patient load, routinely applied treatments and challenges facing availability of standard treatment options. Data were analyzed with Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 15 (Chicago Illinois, USA), and presented descriptively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Responses were returned from 17 otolaryngologists (68% [17/25]) practicing in institutions across the six geopolitical zones with a mean duration of otolaryngology services of 22.4 (14.8) years. The CSOM patients constitute an average of 25.3% (13.1) of ENT patient load, with an average of 31 (15.3) % having significant hearing loss. Surgery have never been tried in 41% (7/17) of the institutions due to lack of facilities and/or expertise. Among institutions that offer surgery, 40% (4/10) offer only cortical mastoidectomy and only 30% (3/10) offer type 1 tympanoplasty. Achievements of permanent dry ears were reported more in institutions that offer surgery. Unaffordable cost of hearing aid and lack of expertise for tympanoplasty are the major challenging factors for rehabilitation of CSOM induced hearing loss., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Considering the enormity of CSOM in Nigeria, and the fact that > 40% (7/17) of the public health institutions still lack facilities and/or expertise for surgical treatments for CSOM, public otolaryngological centers should not only be adequately equipped for tympanomastoid surgeries, attention should be focused on further training of experts in the operative techniques from within and outside the country.

N2  - The objective of the present study was to compare the results of different surgical approaches to the treatment of tympanoplasty in the patients presenting with "dry" mesotympanitis. We compared the morphological and functional outcomes of tympanoplasty in 49 patients allocated to the three study groups. Group 1 was comprised of 28 patients that underwent tympanoplasty using the endaural (intrameatal) approach through an ear speculum. Group 2 consisted of 16 patients that underwent tympanoplasty using the endaural(intrameatal) approach through type A and B intercatilaginous incisions by the method of Heermann, Group 3 included 5 patients who underwent tympanoplasty using the postaural transcanal approach. The analysis of the outcomes of surgeries has demonstrated that the best morphological and functional results were obtained in the patients of groups 2 and 3.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: A high-fidelity, inexpensive middle ear simulator could be created to enhance surgical training that would be rated as having high face validity by experts., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: With rapid prototyping using additive manufacturing technology (AMT), one can create high-resolution 3-dimensional replicas of the middle ear at low cost and high fidelity. Such a simulator could be of great benefit for surgical training, particularly in light of new resident training guidelines., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: AMT was used to create surgical middle ear simulator (SMS) with 2 different materials simulating bone and soft tissue. The simulator is composed of an outer box with dimensions of an average adult external auditory canal without scutum and an inner cartridge based on an otosclerosis model. The simulator was then rated by otology experts in terms of face validity and fidelity as well as their opinion on the usefulness of such a device., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Eighteen otologists from 6 tertiary academic centers rated the simulator; 83.3% agreed or highly agreed that SMS has accurate dimensions and 66.6% that it has accurate tactile feedback. When asked if performance of stapedotomy with the SMS improves with practice, 46% agreed. As to whether practicing stapedotomy with the SMS translates to improvement with live surgery, 78% agreed with this statement. Experts' average rating of the components of SMS (of possible 5) was as follows: middle ear dimensions, 3.9; malleus, 3.7; incus, 3.6; stapes, 3.6; chorda tympani, 3.7; tensor tympani, 4.1; stapedius, 3.8; facial nerve, 3.7; and promontory, 3.5. Overall, 83% found SMS to be at least "very useful" in training of novices, particularly for junior and senior residents., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Most experts found the SMS to be accurate, but there was a large discrepancy in rating of individual components. Most found it to be very useful for training of novice surgeons. With these results, we are encouraged to proceed with further refinements that will strengthen the SMS as a training tool for otologic surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess the factors affecting health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after ear surgery in patients with chronic otitis media (COM)., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective questionnaire-based outcome study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary care institution., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: The study population comprised 205 patients aged 21 to 67 years referred for ear surgery owing to COM with or without cholesteatoma between November 2009 and March 2011., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: The ear surgery for COM included tympanoplasty, with or without mastoidectomy. The Korean version of the Chronic Ear Survey (K-CES), a disease-specific outcome survey, was administered before and 12 months after surgery., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: The primary outcome measures were the total score and subscale score, including an activity restriction-based subscale, symptom subscale, and medical resource utilization subscale. The scores were analyzed with disease- and patient-related factors affecting health-related quality of life., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of the 205 patients enrolled, complete data from 156 patients were available for this study. The K-CES score in patients with COM improved after ear surgery in total and in all subscales of the K-CES (P < .001). In univariable analysis, poor improvement in total K-CES score was more likely to occur after ear surgery in patients with postoperative complications, diabetes mellitus, hearing loss as a chief complaint, lower air conduction threshold in postoperative audiometry, and a high level of education and in those who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy (P < .05). Multivariable analysis using multiple linear regression revealed that the occurrence of complications, presence of diabetes mellitus, level of education, and postoperative air conduction thresholds were independent factors for poor improvement in total K-CES score (P < .05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Recognition of factors that have significant relation with subjective outcomes may help surgeons to identify patients who are prone to have a lower satisfaction and provide useful information in preoperative counseling.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: Chronic otitis media surgery is the most common procedure in otology in developing countries. Subtotal and total tympanic membrane (TM) perforation with inadequate anterior remnant is associated with higher rate of graft failure. It was the goal of this study to test the anatomical and functional outcomes of a modified underlay myringoplasty technique., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: In a prospective clinical study, 45 patients with subtotal or total TM perforation and inadequate anterior remnant underwent tympanoplasty (+/-mastoidectomy). The anterior tip of the temporalis fascia was secured in a mucosal pocket on the lateral wall of eustachian tube orifice. Data on graft take rate, preoperative and postoperative hearing status, and intraoperative findings were analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: We achieved the graft success rate of 91.1%, without lateralization, blunting, atelectasia, or epithelial pearls. Approximately 24% patients had air-bone gap within 25 dB before intervention, which increased to 71% postoperatively (P < .001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: We believe that this technique could be a convenient and suitable method for cases with subtotal or total TM perforation and inadequate anterior remnant.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2012 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The purpose of this work was to assess postoperative pain management after middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: In a prospective clinical study, 73 adults were evaluated on the first postoperative day after middle ear surgery using the questionnaire of the Germany-wide project QUIPS (quality improvement in postoperative pain management). The main outcome measures were patients' characteristics, pain parameters, outcome, and pain therapy process parameters., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Overall, pain on the first postoperative day was mild. Pain management consisted predominately of premedication with midazolam, remifentanil intraoperatively, metamizole in the recovery room and on the ward. Otherwise healthy patients suffered significantly more from pain than patients with reduced general condition in univariate and multivariate analyses. About half of the patients demanded pain relief on the ward. Despite immediate pain management with nonopioids and/or opioids, these patients had significantly more maximal pain and were less satisfied with overall pain therapy than patients not demanding pain therapy., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION</ovid:b>: QUIPS is a simple tool to evaluate the quality of in-hospital postoperative pain management following ear surgery. Pain on the first postoperative day seems to be moderate but should be improved for patients demanding more analgetics despite baseline pain therapy on the ward.

N2  - <ovid:b>PROBLEM DESCRIPTION</ovid:b>: Nowadays all procedures in tympanoplasty are performed using conventional instrumentation without any mechatronic based manipulators. A micromanipulator system (MMS) holds microinstruments and transmits the surgeon's hand movements to a monitor, thus, improving precision and ergonomics., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Using the Cartesian principle, a telemanipulator with three linear degrees of freedom controlled with a joystick was designed. The three axes are powered by a servomotor. The manipulator is equipped with a sterilizable instrument holder, which is placed on a sterile covered system. On this instrument holder, sterile surgical instruments can be clipped and can be easily changed during surgery. In the scope of this study, the MMS was used to perform a tympanoplasty III in 20 patients. A workflow expert protocol, a video of the surgery, and a questionnaire completed by all surgeons were evaluated., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Clinical use of the MMS 2.0 was performed in all 20 patients as planned. A partial/total ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP/TORP) was used in all cases with the MMS as planned. Significantly more time was necessary not only to prepare for surgery but also to prepare the equipment intraoperatively, and the incision to suture time was longer. The number of intraoperative changes of instruments decreased by 24%. The frequency of contact between the instrument and the prosthesis was significantly decreased. All questionnaires indicated that further improvement of the MMS is needed., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The manipulator MMS 2.0 was successfully used in the clinical setting for the first time. The tool offers great potential for middle ear surgery (e.g., tympanoplasty III, stapes surgery and cochlear implant insertion). The principal of telemanipulation (master-slave) could be transferred to middle ear surgery. However, numerous technical improvements are still required.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To date, all the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) applications have managed to stimulate the inner ear indirectly. Our objective was to present a new VSB application for direct inner ear stimulation., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective cohort study., <ovid:b>SETTINGS</ovid:b>: Tertiary, referral center, <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Three patients with previous middle ear surgery and moderate-to-severe ipsilateral, mixed hearing loss., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Oval window membrane vibroplasty (OWMV) for direct acoustic cochlear stimulation. A total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) was attached to the floating mass transducer (FMT). Then, the stapes footplate was perforated, and the tip of the FMT-TORP assembly was advanced approximately 1 mm into the inner ear. A silicon ring was placed around the TORP's tip to prevent it from slipping deeper into the inner ear., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: Audiologic assessment involving pure-tone audiometry, aided and unaided free-field audiometry, Freiburg monosyllabic word test, and registration of any complications., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: OWMV resulted in an average functional hearing gain of 36.1 dB (range, 24.2-47.5 dB). Although the greatest amplification was observed in the higher frequencies, there also was a significant improvement in the lower frequencies. The surgery was not related to any difficulties; vertigo, inner ear trauma, or further complications did not occur., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: We present a new method for direct acoustic cochlear stimulation using an active middle ear implant. The preliminary results show that OWMV is a promising and safe option for treating moderate and severe hearing loss, even in challenging cases with previous middle ear operations or fixed stapes footplate.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: As prostheses and techniques related to stapes surgery develop and improve, there is a need to assess the functional outcomes of the surgery objectively. This study provides a bench test method to assess the functional results of stapes surgery by measuring volume displacement at the round window (RW), which is closely related to pressure propagation of the travelling wave inside the cochlea and thus to hearing., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Motion of the RW membrane in fresh temporal bones was measured using a scanning laser Doppler interferometry system for normal and reconstructed conditions, and the performance of the reconstruction with stapes surgery was quantitatively assessed by comparison of the volume displacements at the RW between the two conditions. To obtain optimal measurements, reflectivity of the laser beam of the scanning laser Doppler interferometry system was improved by retroreflective beads coated onto the surface of the RW, and orientation of the RW membrane relative to the laser beam was obtained using micro-computed tomography imaging., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: From measurements in 12 temporal bones, difference in the RW volume displacement between normal ears and ears reconstructed with stapes surgery was approximately 15 dB below 2 kHz and approximately 10 dB above 4 kHz, which was comparable with air-bone gaps in patients after stapes surgery. Two different sizes of the stapes prostheses were also tested (n = 3), and a tendency toward a better outcome with a larger diameter was found., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The method developed in this study can be used to assess various prostheses and surgical conditions objectively in controlled laboratory environments. It may also have potential for providing ways to assess other middle- and inner-ear surgeries, and to study other aspects of hearing science.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: The Esteem is a totally implantable hearing system that uses piezoelectric technology. It is indicated in case of moderate to severe stable sensorineural hearing loss with a minimum discrimination score of 60% and a middle ear which is anatomically and functionally intact. Its two components (sensor and driver) are positioned and fixed in the mastoid cavity and coupled respectively to the incus body and capitulum with cement., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective study., <ovid:b>SETTINGS</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Pure-tone average (PTA) gain in the implanted ear was calculated at 1, 2, and 4 KHz, word recognition score (WRS) gain at 50 dB SPL, and average WRS (AWRS) gain at 40, 55, and 70 dB SPL. WRS was also evaluated in silence and noise. All patients were asked to fill in the abbreviated profile of hearing aid benefit (APHAB) questionnaire pre- and postoperatively as well as an Esteem questionnaire., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Thirteen patients received implants between May 2008 and April 2010. Five minor complications occurred (1 temporary partial facial palsy, 1 secondary healing difficulty, and 3 revision surgeries for poor and deteriorating functional results and progressive gain loss after use of a heart defibrillator). Two patients (15%) suffered major complications and their implants had to be removed 4 months postoperatively because of a Staphylococcus aureus wound infection. One patient underwent reimplantation 6 months later. Mean PTA gain was 25 +/- 11 dB, mean WRS gain at 50 dB SPL was 64 +/- 33%, and mean AWRS gain was 40 +/- 20%. WRS in silence and with a signal-noise ratio of 10, 0, and -5 dB was 91 +/- 11, 85 +/- 14, 71 +/- 19, and 64 +/- 30%, respectively. The APHAB questionnaire revealed 84% of satisfaction improvement compared to the previous classic hearing aid., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The totally implantable hearing device Esteem 2 can offer good functional and satisfaction results. Careful selection of patients is required, however, based on hearing tests, exclusion of middle ear ventilation problems, and CAT-scan middle ear anatomy. Specific surgical training and experience are also needed. The implant is safe and only associated with classic auditory implant complications.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2012 S.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: In this study, we compared the functional results of incus interposition and the use of bone cement in patients who underwent type 2 tympanoplasty due to isolated incus defects., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A total of 47 patients including 12 patients with incus interposition and 35 patients with bone cement were enrolled in the study. The middle ear risk indices (MERI) of the patients were evaluated from the patient files. The mean air conduction thresholds at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz and air-bone gap were estimated, evaluating preoperative and postoperative audiogram results at 12 months of all patients. The success rate of surgery and functional outcomes were compared between the patients of similar MERI groups on which ossicular reconstruction was performed using different methods (bone cement or incus interposition)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In all patients, there was a statistical significant improvement in terms of the mean air conductance threshold and decrease in the mean air-bone gap (p<0.001, p=0.001). The comparison of percentage changes of functional gain between incus interposition and bone cement groups showed no statistically significant difference (p=0.542, p=0.534)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In this study, similar functional outcomes were attained between the patient groups in which type 2 tympanoplasty with either sculptured incus interposition or bone cement was performed. Several factors including the cost of the material to be used, status of the middle ear and ossicles, defect size, and experience of the surgeon should be also considered.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To investigate the possible clinical relationship between gastroesophageal reflux disease and the type one tympanoplasty surgical outcomes of adults with chronic otitis media, by using a simple, cost-effective, reliable questionnaire and physical findings., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Fifty-two of 147 patients undergoing type one tympanoplasty were studied. Gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms were evaluated using the Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease questionnaire. Laryngoscopic physical findings of laryngopharyngeal reflux were evaluated using the Reflux Finding Score. A successful outcome was defined as an intact tympanic membrane. Correlations between the two assessment tool results and the patient's surgical success were calculated., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire score was significantly higher in patients with unsuccessful tympanic membrane closure (group one) than in patients with successful closure (group two) (p < 0.05). The Reflux Finding Score was also significantly higher in group one than group two (p < 0.05). There was a significant positive relationship between the gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire score and the Reflux Finding Score (p < 0.01)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Gastroesophageal reflux disease may be a significant prognostic factor for tympanoplasty failure. Therefore, reflux investigation may be important during the treatment of chronic otitis media, and positive cases may need reflux treatment as well as ear disease treatment.

N2  - The ossicular chain of the human middle ear has a key role in sound conduction since it transfers vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the cochlea, connecting the outer and the inner part of the hearing organ. This study reports firstly a description of the main anatomical features of the middle ear to introduce a detailed survey of its biomechanics, focused on model development, with a collection of geometric, inertial and mechanical/material parameters. The joint issues are particularly discussed from the perspective of developing a model of the middle ear both explanatory and predictive. Such a survey underlines the remarkable dispersion of data, due also to the lack of a standardization of the experimental techniques and conditions. Subsequently, a 3D multi-body model of the ossicular chain and other structures of the middle ear is described. Such an approach is justified as the ossicles were proven to behave as rigid bodies in the human hearing range and was preferred to the more widely used finite element one as it simplifies the model development and improves joint modeling. The displacement of the umbo (a reference point of the tympanic membrane) in the 0.3-6kHz frequency range was defined as input of the model, while the stapes footplate displacement as output. A parameter identification procedure was used to find parameter values for reproducing experimental and numerical reference curves taken from the literature. This simple model might represent a valid alternative to more complex models and might provide a useful tool to simulate pathological/post-surgical/post-traumatic conditions and evaluate ossicular replacement prostheses.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2012 IPEM.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate the effects and the predictive value of environmental risk factors on the success of different reconstruction materials used in ossiculoplasty., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective case review., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral university hospital., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Between January 2007 and October 2010, 110 patients who underwent ossiculoplasty with or without mastoidectomy due to chronic otitis media were enrolled in the study. All patients were classified into 1 of the 3 risk groups (mild, moderate, and severe) according to their measured Middle Ear Risk Index score., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: The patients underwent exploratory tympanotomy, tympanoplasty, or tympanomastoidectomy (canal wall-up or wall-down), all with ossicular reconstruction. The ossicular reconstructions were performed using either bone cement, autologous bone interposition, or allograft material., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: For each patient, the air-conduction threshold and air-bone gap (ABG) were measured at the 12th month after ossiculoplasty. The ABG gain and air-conduction improvement were compared with preoperative values. The correlation of the success of ossiculoplasty with the middle ear risk group of patients was investigated. Moreover, the efficacy of different types of reconstruction material on the success of ossiculoplasty in the same risk group was evaluated., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In the mild- and moderate-risk groups, the ABG gain (p = 0.001 and p = 0.014) and air-conduction improvement (p < 0.001 for both) were statistically significant, whereas those changes were found to be insignificant in the severe-risk group. Moreover, the ABG gain and air-conduction improvement in none of the risk groups revealed a significance in favor of any of the used reconstruction materials., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The results of this study revealed that none of the reconstruction materials or specific techniques have a superiority in the functional outcomes in patients from the same middle ear risk group. We conclude that the success of ossiculoplasty is highly correlated with the pathophysiological status of the middle ear and is independent of the type of replacement material.

N2  - Developments in surgical technique and, more importantly, the use of increasingly sophisticated biocompatible prostheses have meant that good results can be achieved for otosclerosis sufferers in terms of restored hearing and very little postsurgical discomfort. We set out to assess whether the diameter of the prostheses used for stapedotomy (platinum piston/polytetrafluoroethylene, i.e. Teflon) has any effect on surgical outcome. Two groups of otosclerotic patients were selected, and these underwent stapedotomy surgery during the second phase of the disease. A piston-Teflon type prosthesis was used, 5.50 mm in terms of length but of different diameters (group A: 0.4 mm; group B: 0.6 mm). All the patients underwent the same pure-tone audiometry test before surgery, and then at 1 week and 1 month after surgery, to assess function. We compared air conduction after surgery with bone conduction before surgery. The data collected was analysed using the chi(2) (p < 0.05) test. This analysis showed that the results obtained with a 0.4-mm prosthesis or a 0.6-mm prosthesis are almost identical. There was no statistically significant difference in terms of hearing results when comparing either average tonal threshold or when analysing audiometric data frequency by frequency. It can be concluded, therefore, that in stapedotomy surgery, functional recovery is not affected by the diameter of the prosthesis used. A smaller diameter prosthesis is, however, the one of choice when the facial nerve is prominent or the oval window particularly narrow.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2012 S.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: Facial synkinesis and hyperkinesis commonly impair the outcome of facial nerve palsy. Botulinum toxin type A has shown positive results in the treatment of these symptoms. Our experience is reported in this article., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Forty-one patients affected by facial synkinesis and hyperkinesis due to facial palsy were treated. The etiology of the facial palsy was: 28 Bell's palsy cases, nine iatrogenic cases (seven acoustic neuroma surgeries, one tympano-jugular glomus tumor removal, and one middle ear surgery), three herpes zoster virus cases, and one case of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Botulinum toxin type A was used in the treatment. Clinical evaluation was obtained through the Sunnybrook Grading Scale and an author's modification of this method purposely designed for evaluation of hyperkinesis. Further evaluation through a self-administered synkinesis questionnaire was also performed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All patients showed some improvement of synkinesis and hyperkinesis after treatment. The mean values of the data obtained, regardless of the method of evaluation, gave statistically significant results. Correlation between objective and subjective evaluation methods was also statistically positive., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: This work stresses the importance of considering synkinesis and hyperkinesis separately because they are different conditions. These two symptoms showed improvement after botulinum toxin treatment, but only hyperkinesis showed a positive correlation when objective and subjective evaluations were performed. This treatment is effective in the management of facial synkinesis and hyperkinesis due to facial palsy, thus improving quality of life. It is a safe, minimally invasive treatment that can be repeated.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2012 The American Laryngological, Rhinological, and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To prospectively analyze short-term (3 mo) results in patients with otosclerosis who underwent stapedotomy with the newly designed NiTiBOND prosthesis and compare them with patients that underwent SMart piston stapedotomy. We aimed to assess "noninferiority" for the new prosthesis., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective controlled trial., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Thirty-eight patients were included in the NiTiBOND group (41 ears), and 74 patients were included in the SMart Piston group (75 ears)., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION(S)</ovid:b>: Stapedotomy., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S)</ovid:b>: Pure-tone audiometry 3 months after surgery, intraoperative prosthesis handling as assessed using a questionnaire, and complications were analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Pure-tone audiometry showed postoperative air-bone gap means (standard deviation) of 8.1 (8.3) and 9.9 (5.4) dB; air-bone gap closure within 10 dB was achieved in 71% and 72% and within 20 dB in 93% and 96% for the NiTiBOND and the SMart piston prosthesis, respectively. Noninferiority was shown at all frequencies and in the pure-tone average. The NiTiBOND prosthesis provides excellent intraoperative handling, and no adverse reactions were reported., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Preliminary short-term results suggest safety and reliability for the new NiTiBOND stapes prosthesis.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the inner ear effects of canal wall down (CWD) mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty in the treatment of chronic otitis media (COM) with regard to sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and reported tinnitus and dizziness-related disability., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary care academic medical center., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Prospective study of 86 patients treated by CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty for COM with or without cholesteatoma. Standard patient workup included preoperative audiogram and completion of 2 surveys: Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) and Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI). Patients underwent repeat audiogram, DHI, and THI surveys at 4 to 6 months postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative data were analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: No significant SNHL occurred after CWD mastoidectomy. Thirteen patients (13/34 [38%]) had DHI improvement greater than 18 points, indicating a significant improvement in dizziness-related disability. Three patients developed new-onset postoperative dizziness complaints. Twenty patients (20/43 [46.5%]) had THI improvement greater than 7 points, indicating a significant improvement in tinnitus-related disability. Five patients developed new-onset postoperative tinnitus complaints. The odds ratio for improving DHI and THI scores after surgery was 6.6 (1.8 to 25.0) and 4.2 (95% confidence interval, 1.45% to 12.2%), respectively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In this study, CWD mastoidectomy without ossiculoplasty in the treatment of COM did not cause significant SNHL. In addition, using the DHI and THI measures, patient-perceived disability from dizziness and tinnitus, respectively, was shown to decrease after mastoid surgery.

N2  - We report our experience with island cartilage tympanoplasty in revision cases and assess the anatomical and functional outcomes. We conducted a retrospective chart review at a tertiary referral center for patients who underwent revision tympanoplasty using cartilage with the island technique without mastoidectomy between January 2002 and December 2008. 60 cases were included in the study and successful closure without reperforation was obtained in 52 of 60 patients (87%). Three failed cases underwent a subsequent procedure endaurally with a positive result (92% accumulated success rate). Average postoperative pure-tone audiometry air-bone gap was 13 +/- 7 dB compared with 21 +/- 11 dB preoperatively (p = 0.004). An overall postoperative air-bone gap of 20 dB or less was achieved in 46 of the 60 patients (76.7%). Tympanoplasty with island cartilage grafting is a reliable procedure for revision cases with excellent anatomic results as well as significant improvement of hearing.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To determine the role of intraoperative electrocochleography to optimize the fitting of the floating mass transducer of the Vibrant Soundbridge on the round window membrane in patients with conductive and mixed hearing loss., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective cohort study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center, Otolaryngology Department, University of Verona, Verona, Italy., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Twenty-six adult patients suffering from chronic otitis media with moderate to severe conductive and mixed hearing loss, all with previous unsuccessful functional surgery, underwent round window vibroplasty. Thirteen subjects had intraoperative compound cochlear action potentials measured to assess vibroplasty coupling during and after surgery. In these patients, surgery was modified according to electrocochleographic feedback. The other 13 had vibroplasty without electrocochleography monitoring., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The average preoperative air conduction and bone conduction thresholds (0.5-4 kHz) were not statistically significantly different between the 2 cohorts (P > .05). Compound action potential recordings indicated specific surgical modalities to optimize coupling of the floating mass transducer with the round window membrane. The average postoperative Vibrant Soundbridge-aided air conduction threshold improvements (0.5-4 kHz) were 54.6 +/- 8.9 and 41.7 +/- 11.1 dB HL, respectively, in the monitored and unmonitored cohorts (P = .0032)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Improved round window vibroplasty outcomes are observed when the surgeon is promptly informed of the compound action potential changes induced by the floating mass transducer round window membrane vibroplasty and alters surgery accordingly. The key point for optimal coupling is a floating mass transducer in full contact with the round window membrane, free to vibrate without any contact with the surrounding bony structures and mobile footplate.

Six otosurgeons served as gold standard. Attempts and time of prosthesis placement and time for tympanic membrane reconstruction were recorded. Tremor frequency and amplitude were obtained at the same time points. An adjusted study interest questionnaire was used to assess students' motivation., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Students in Group 2 showed a significant improvement in all reconstruction parameters over the study period compared with both, baseline measurement on first day and Group 1. However, the obtained learning curve did not reach the experts level. Tremor indices and students' motivation showed no correlation with the reconstruction parameters, whereas the training itself had a positive impact on students' interest in the surgical specialty., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Training with the tympanoplasty model is suitable to acquire first microsurgical motor skills in otolaryngology and to arouse students' interest in the surgical field and otorhinolaryngology.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Endoscopic inspections of the middle ear have already been described. So far, the low optical quality due to the small diameter is limiting this type of procedure. In this study the use of a miniature endoscope for visualization of the middle ear structures has been evaluated., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: 8 human cadaveric head specimens have been inspected. Following myringotomy, 2 miniature endoscopes were placed into the middle ear and the promontory, the incudostapedial joint, the round und oval window niche with stapes footplate were visualized and fotodocumentated. After endaural approach all middle ear structures were visualized microscopically and the quality of pictures was compared. Technical picture quality and anatomical visualization were evaluated by 5 ear surgeons. In addition, 2 interventional procedures were performed (control of ossicular chain mobility and intratympanic substance application)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Still, the technical picture quality was significantly better for the microscope. The anatomical visualization of the middle ear structures with the miniature endoscope was not inferior compared to the microscope. The feasibility of additional interventions, e.g. control of ossicular chain mobility or intratympanic substance application could be shown. An inspection of the correct prosthesis position after tympanoplasty could be evaluated, too., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study showed that middle ear structures can be visualized by trans-tympanic miniature endoscopy equal or even better compared to conventional microscopy in spite of reduced technical quality.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart .

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: This study has been designed to investigate the clinical association between gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD) and chronic otitis media (COM) in adults and also the role of GERD treatment on the outcome of COM surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In a randomized clinical trial, 58 patients with COM who were candidates for surgery were evaluated for GERD and divided in two groups; GERD positive (case) and GERD negative (control) patients. The GERD positive patients were randomized to either receiving medical treatment for GERD or not prior to surgery. The surgical outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months after COM surgery in the three groups., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Fifty-eight (26 males) patients were enrolled. Forty-two (72.4%) of these had GERD according to a validated questionnaire. Three months after surgery auditory recovery in GERD negative patients was significantly higher [16(100%)] than those suffering from GERD [28 out of 42 (66.7%)], p=0.008. The figures remained similar at six months follow up as well (100 % vs. 72.5% in GERD negative and positive patients respectively, p=0.002). In the GERD-positive group, 8 of 18 (44.4%) patients who did not receive GERD treatment before tympanomastoidectomy recovered after three months whereas, while 20 of 24 (83.3%) patients who received GERD treatment recovered during this time (p<0.001). At six months 44.4% of non-treated GERD patients had auditory recovery as compared to 95.5 % of those treated for GERD (p<0.01)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Our data show that the effect of GERD on the outcome of COM surgery may be considerable. On the other hand, treating COM patients for GERD medically for two months before tympanoplasty improves the surgical outcomes. Therefore, we suggest that COM patients be evaluated for GERD before undergoing tympanoplasty and if GERD is present, they be treated medically for a couple of months before undergoing surgery.

N2  - To study the role of infiltrating 2% Lidocaine in Micro ear surgeries performed under general anaesthesia. To measure the impact of infiltration of 2% Lidocaine in post operative pain relief and per operative bleeding. A Double blinded, Prospective randomized comparative study was conducted in a tertiary care referral centre. A total of 30 patients planned for micro ear surgeries under general anaesthesia (Tympanoplasty and Cortical mastoidectomy) for CSOM tubotympanic disease were selected and divided into two groups randomly by the chief senior consultant. Group A patients received local infiltration of 2% Lidocaine with one in 200,000 adrenaline and Group B patients received infiltration of one in 200,000 adrenaline in distilled water alone. Operating surgeon assessed the bleeding in the surgical field using Boezaart's grading system. Post operative pain was assessed using a visual analog scale. Pain scores of these patients were assessed in the 1st, 4 and 24th h post operatively and recorded. The mean post operative pain score in the 1st h for the patients in Group A was 0.93 and for patients in Group B was two. The difference in the pain scores between the two groups was significant (P < 0.02). The difference in the mean post operative pain scores between the two groups in the 4 and 24th h were not significant (P < 0.1). Per operatively, grade III bleeding was present in 73% of patients in group B and only 33% of patients had grade III bleeding in group A. Infiltration of 2% Lidocaine has a significant impact over the grade of bleeding in the operative field and also on 1st h post operative pain relief. It did not have a significant influence on the pain relief in the 4 and 24th h post operatively.

N2  - Carcinoma of the external auditory canal (EAC) is an unusual head and neck malignancy. The pathophysiology of these tumors is different from other skin lesions because of their anatomical and functional characteristics. Early-stage carcinoma of the EAC can be generally cured by surgical treatment, and reconstruction of the EAC with a tympanoplasty can help to retain hearing, thus improving the patients' quality of life. In this study, we present two cases of early-stage carcinoma of the EAC treated by canal reconstruction using skin grafts after lateral temporal bone resection. A rolled-up skin graft with a temporal muscle flap was useful for keeping the form and maintaining the postoperative hearing. An adequate size of the skin graft and blood supply to the graft bed are important for achieving a successful operation.

N2  - Since the first description of middle ear osteomas by Thomas in 1964, only few reports were published within the English literatures (Greinwalid et al., 1998; Shimizu et al., 2003; Cho et al., 2005; and Jang et al., 2009), and only one case of the multiple osteomas in middle ear was described by Kim et al., 2006, which arose from the promontory, lateral semicircular canal, and epitympanum. Here we describe a patient with multiple middle ear osteomas arising from the promontory, incus, Eustachian tube, and bony semicanal of tensor tympani muscle. This patient also contracted the chronic otitis media in the ipsilateral ear. The osteomas were successfully removed by performing type III tympanoplasty in one stage.

N2  - Objective . To visually compare the Nitinol "smart" stapes prosthesis to conventional manual crimping stapes pistons in temporal bone cadaver specimens. Main Outcome Measures. 10 otolaryngologists were given a photograph of the randomly ordered stapes pistons and asked to use the pictures to answer questions about each stapes piston. The answers to the survey were then recorded for analysis. Results . 8 of 9 Nitinol pistons were described as circular, and 3 of 9 manual crimped pistons were described as circular (P < .05). 6 of 9 Nitinol pistons were considered to be in contact with >66% of the incus and 3 of 9 to be in contact with 34-66% of the incus. 3 of 9 manually crimped pistons were considered to be in contact with >66% of the incus, 3 with 34-66% contact and 3 with less than 34% contact. Conclusions . The Nitinol "smart" stapes pistons were considered to provide a more circular and circumferential crimping and to have greater contact with the long process of the incus than conventional stapes pistons.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The incidence of fistulas found during the surgery for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma has been reported in a wide range in different geographical areas. This study aims to find the prevalence of labyrinthine fistula in the south of Iran., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A prospective cross sectional study of 787 (504 ears belong to 462 patients) consecutive tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy for chronic otitis media was performed. Data on preoperative clinical and preoperative and postoperative hearing status and intraoperative findings were analyzed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A labyrinthine fistula was found at surgery in 24 (4.7%) ears of the total 504 ears belonging to 462 patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media. Location of the fistula was the lateral semicircular canal in 23, posterior semicircular canal in 1 and promontory in 1 subject. There was a statistically significant difference in preoperative and postoperative AC threshold in 500-3000 Hz frequency and ABG 500-3000 Hz, but there was no statistically significant difference in the other variables., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Regarding postoperative hearing outcome in the labyrinthine fistula surgery, it seems that there is no universal method of reporting of hearing results. Past hearing evaluation methods in the literature have been often poorly comparable, based on different methodology.

N2  - Background. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the thermal and pressure effects using a Titan Sapphire chirped-pulse amplifier system configured to deliver ultrashort pulses of 180 femtoseconds (fs) in an inner ear model. Materials and Methods. Temperature increases and heat exchange processes in the fluid (physiological saline) were examined in a calorically and physiologically approximated cochlea model for applying laser parameters effective in the creation of footplate perforations. Results . In the effective energy density range, the highest temperature increases achieved with the Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) laser were about 11 degrees C. The lowest temperature maxima were 6 degrees C with the Er:YAG laser (Yttrium-Aluminum-Oxide doted with Erbium3+-ions) and <5 degrees C with the femtosecond laser. Comparison of the laser-induced pressure with the limit graph published by Pfander indicated that the use of the fs laser is unobjectionable for fluences <1 J/cm(2). Conclusions . Our investigations demonstrated that the application of the fs laser in middle ear surgery presents a new and promising addition to the range of ultrashort wavelength lasers used for this purpose.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Controlled hypotension is a technique that is used to limit intraoperative blood loss to provide the best possible surgical field during surgery., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this double-blind, randomized, controlled study was to compare the effects of desflurane combined with esmolol or dexmedetomidine on the amount of blood in the surgical field, recovery time, and tolerability in adult patients undergoing tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Turkish patients aged 18 to 60 years, classified as American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I or II, who were scheduled for tympanoplasty were randomly divided into 2 groups: the esmolol group or the dexmedetomidine group. After the anesthesia induction in the esmolol group, a loading dose of esmolol was infused intravenously over 1 minute at 1 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance rate of 0.4 to 0.8 mg/ kg/h. In the dexmedetomidine group, a loading dose of dexmedetomidine was infused intravenously over 10 minutes at a rate of 1 mug/kg, followed by a maintenance rate of 0.4 to 0.8 mug/kg/h. The infusion rates were then titrated to maintain mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 to 75 mm Hg. General anesthesia was maintained with desflurane 4% to 6%. Heart rate (HR) and MAP were recorded during anesthesia. The following 6-point scale was used to assess the amount of bleeding in the operative field: 0 = no bleeding, a virtually bloodless field; 1 = bleeding that was so mild that it was not a surgical nuisance; 2 = moderate bleeding that was a nuisance but did not interfere with accurate dissection; 3 = moderate bleeding that moderately compromised surgical dissection; 4 = bleeding that was heavy but controllable and that significantly interfered with surgical dissection; and 5 = massive bleeding that was uncontrollable and made dissection impossible. Scores <=2 were considered to be optimal surgical conditions. The sedation score was determined at 15, 30, and 60 minutes after tracheal extubation using the following scale: 1 = anxious, agitated, or restless; 2 = cooperative, oriented, and tranquil; 3 = responsive to commands; 4 = asleep, but with brisk response to light, glabellar tap, or loud auditory stimulus; 5 = asleep, sluggish response to glabellar tap or auditory stimulus; and 6 = asleep, no response. Time to extubation and to total recovery from anesthesia (Aldrete score >=9 on a scale of 0-10), adverse effects (eg, intraoperative hypotension [blood pressure <65 mm Hg], bradycardia [HR <50 beats/min]), intraoperative fentanyl consumption, and postoperative nausea and vomiting were recorded. Arterial blood gas analysis and kidney and liver function tests were conducted. All patients were evaluated by the same attending surgeon and anesthesiologist, both of whom were blinded to the administered study drugs., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Fifty-two consecutive white patients undergoing tympanoplasty were identified. Two patients had to be excluded because of hypertension and 2 refused to participate. Forty-eight patients were equally randomized to either the esmolol group (n = 24 [16 women, 8 men]; mean [SD] age, 38.4 [10.5] years) or the dexmedetomi-dine group (n = 24 [17 women, 7 men]; mean age, 35.5 [14.7] years). Sedation scores were not collected for 1 patient in the esmolol group; therefore, analysis was conducted for 23 patients. The median (range) of the scores for the amount of blood in the surgical field in the esmolol and dexmedetomidine groups was 1 (0-3) and 1 (0-2), respectively (P = NS). Mean intraoperative fentanyl consumption in the esmolol group was significantly higher than in the dexmedetomidine group (50.0 [3.0] vs 25.0 [2.5] mug/min; P = 0.002). In the esmolol group, the mean times to extubation and to recovery from anesthesia were significantly shorter than those of the dexmedetomidine group (7.0 [1.4] vs 9.1 [1.9] minutes, respectively; 5.9 [2.1] vs 7.9 [2.3] minutes; both, P = 0.001). The mean sedation scores were significantly lower in the esmolol group (n = 23, because of intent-to-treat analysis) compared with the dexmedetomidine group at 15 minutes (2.5 [0.6] vs 3.6 [0.5]; P = 0.001) and 30 minutes (2.6 [0.6] vs 3.3 [0.6]; P = 0.001) postoperatively. No significant differences were found between the study groups in regard to blood urea nitrogen or creatinine concentration, aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase activities, pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide, or bicarbonate, before or after the operation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Both esmolol and dexmedetomidine, combined with desflurane, provided an effective and well-tolerated method of achieving controlled hypotension to limit the amount of blood in the surgical field in these adult patients undergoing tympanoplasty. Esmolol was associated with significantly shorter extubation and recovery times and significantly less postoperative sedation compared with dexmedetomidine.

The material of choice in cases of partial ossicular replacement prosthesis is the autogenous ossicle. In the event of more extensive destruction of the ossicular chain diverse alloplastic materials, e.g. metals, ceramics, plastics or composits are used for total reconstruction. Their specialised role in conducting sound energy within a half-open implant bed sets high demands on the biocompatibility as well as the acoustic-mechanic properties of the prosthesis. Recently, sophisticated titanium middle ear implants allowing individual adaptation to anatomical variations are widely used for this procedure. However, despite modern developments, hearing restoration with passive implants often faces its limitations due to tubal-middle-ear dysfunction. Here, implantable hearing aids, successfully used in cases of sensorineural hearing loss, offer a promising alternative. This article reviews the actual state of affairs of passive and active middle ear implants.

N2  - Numerous Fusarium species have been associated with Fusarium head blight of wheat. In Poland, Fusarium poae was reported as the dominant species isolated from wheat grain during seasons with low amounts of rainfall during anthesis (1). F. langsethiae was described as a new toxigenic Fusarium species (3) and causal agent of Fusarium head blight (2), which has been isolated from infected oats, wheat, and barley in northern and central Europe (Norway, Austria, Germany, Czech Republic, Denmark, and England) (2). On the basis of morphological similarities, F. langsethiae has long been identified as a "powdery" form of F. poae. However, F. langsethiae produces type A trichothecene toxins such as T-2, whereas F. poae produces nivalenol and other 8-keto trichothecenes, scirpentriol, and 15-acetoxyscirpenol. In 2006, we obtained several isolates of F. langsethiae from kernels collected from winter wheat ears with head blight symptoms. Isolates were collected in the central (Sobiejuchy 52degree54'N, 17degree43'E; Minikowo 53degree29'N, 17degree56'E) and northern (Radostowo 53degree59'N, 18degree45'E) regions of Poland. Strains were isolated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium (pH 5.5). Further analyses were conducted on single-spore isolates. Initial species identification of all isolates was conducted on the basis of morphological features. The strains were grown in darkness at 25degreeC on PDA in plastic petri dishes to diagnose colony color, odor, and growth rate. The cultures also were incubated on saltwater nutrient agar (SNA) at 25degreeC for 7 days in near-UV light (Philips TLD 36W/08) and darkness in a 12/12-h cycle to promote conidia formation. The calculated average mycelial growth rate per day was based on the difference in millimeters between the colony diameters after 4 and 7 days of incubation. Growth rates ranged from 5.4 to 10.3 mm/day for nine strains. Mycelium was whitish or pinkish white, sparse, and 1 to 3 mm high with no odor. All colonies showed a powdery mycelium surface. Microconidia was napiform or globose, nonseptate, sporadically 1-septate, with an average length of 6.4 mum (range 3.9 to 13.7 mum) and width of 5.6 mum (range 2.9 to 8.8 mum). Microconidia were formed in heads, borne on unbranched or branched monophialides that were 8.5 to 16.3 mum long. All strains had slim, bent monophialides, typical for F. langsethiae, and always a few, short, thick, and squat ones resembling F. poae. In young cultures, monophialides may be formed directly on hyphae. Formation of macroconidia, sclerotia, and chlamydospores were not observed after 3 weeks of incubation. Species identification was confirmed by PCR assay with the use of SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) primers producing a 310-bp DNA fragment (4), which was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. EU088404). To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. langsethiae in Poland. References: (1) C. Sadowski et al. J. Appl. Genet. 43A:69, 2002. (2) M. Torp and A. Adler. Int. J.

N2  - Durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) is one of the most widely grown crops in Italy, extending to approximately 1.5 million ha. Seedborne fungi, affecting both germination and commercial quality of the product, represent a threat to wheat production. Several Fusarium species produce mycotoxins, secondary metabolites harmful to humans and animals. In 2006, monitoring the health status of durum wheat kernels from central (Pollenza, MC) and southern Italy (Foggia; Gravina di Puglia, BA; Enna) was conducted. Kernels at the 11.3 Feeke's scale growth stage were analyzed with the deep freezing blotter test (1). Ten isolates morphologically similar to Fusarium poae were observed. For identification, monosporic isolates were transferred onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and carnation leaf agar (CLA) to grow at 23degreeC with exposure to 12-h alternate cycles of darkness and near-UV light (Philips TLD 18W/08 Blacklight Blue Fluorescent Lamp, peak 360 nm). The shape and dimension of microconidia were similar to those of F. poae. The average radial daily growth rate (4.7 +/- 1.0 mm day<ovid:sup>-1</ovid:sup>) of seven isolates at 23degreeC was significantly different (P < 0.05) from those of F. poae (8.8 +/- 0.2 mm day<ovid:sup>-1</ovid:sup>) and F. sporotrichioides (9.4 +/- 0.3 mm day<ovid:sup>-1</ovid:sup>). In addition to a slower growth rate, these isolates differed from F. poae because of a powdery appearance on PDA, the presence of polyphialides, the absence of macroconidia, and the lack of the peach-like odor. On the basis of the characters observed, the fungus was identified as F. langsethiae, a species recently described from several grains, including wheat (2). To confirm the diagnosis, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of four isolates (ISPaVe ER-1399, ER-1400, ER-1401, and ER-1402) was amplified using universal primers ITS4 and ITS5 (3). The 546-bp product obtained was directly sequenced at the GenLab, Enea, Rome. A homology search using the BLASTn algorithm of all obtained sequences showed 100% identity with GenBank sequence AY680864, corresponding to F. langsethiae. One of these sequences (ISPaVe ER-1400) was deposited in GenBank with Accession No. EF526078. The DNAs of four isolates of F. langsethiae and one each of F. poae and F. sporotrichioides were amplified with the F. langsethiae-specific primers FlangF3 and LanspoR1 (4). The PCR conditions consisted of the initial denaturation at 94degreeC for 2 min, 35 cycles each of 30 sec at 94degreeC, 30 sec at 58degreeC, 1 min at 72degreeC, and a final extension at 72degreeC for 7 min. No amplification was obtained from F. poae and F. sporotrichioides, while a PCR product of the expected size (310 bp) was obtained from all F. langsethiae isolates, confirming their specific identification. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. langsethiae on durum wheat in Italy. This species is known to produce the T2 and HT2 toxins, type A trichotecenes related to alimentary toxic aleukia in humans and haematotoxicity and immunotoxiciticy in animals. A large-scale monitoring of this fungus on durum wheat in Italy is in progress. References: (1) T. Limonard. Neth. J. Plant Pathol. 72:319, 1966. (2) M. Torp and H. I. Nirenberg. Int. J.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: There is a variety of medical and non-medical therapies in practice, which were not evaluated regarding its effectiveness by any systematic evidence oriented investigation. A number of therapies of medical and non-medical type try to treat the different types of tinnitus. The evidence in the scientific literature also had to be cleared in the field of diagnosis and classification as well as medical/psychiatric/psychological procedures of existing medical therapy., <ovid:b>QUESTION</ovid:b>: The HTA report had to investigate the following questions: Which evidence do diagnostic methods in recognition of tinnitus have? Which types of therapy show medical effectiveness at the acute or chronic tinnitus without an organic cause? Which consequences (need for further research, future procedures) can be drawn?, <ovid:b>METHODOLOGY</ovid:b>: In the following databases "tinnitus" was searched according to the search string: HTA97; INAHTA; CDAR94; CDSR93; CCTR93; ME66; ME0A; HT83; SM78; CA66; CB85; BA70; BA93; EM74; IS74; ET80; EB94; IA70; AZ72; CV72; GE79; EU93; HN69; ED93; EA08, <ovid:b>RESULT</ovid:b>: 1932 studies, unsorted after assessment in accordance with EBM criterions, selection: 409 studies. Due to the completely heterogeneous representation modes of the therapeutic approaches at the treatment of the chronic tinnitus no quantitative synthesis method could be performed. Therefore the methodology of a qualitative overview has been carried out., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The diagnostic confirmation of the non-specific tinnitus without organic cause meets with the problem of the assurance of the diagnosis tinnitus. According to the current opinion the stepwise diagnostics is carried out also in the case of the so called subjective tinnitus. Nothing can be said about the evidence of these procedures since no publication was found about that. A study concerning the evidence of the diagnostic questionnaires from Goebel and Hiller [1] comes to the end that the tinnitus questionnaire frequently used (TF) [2] is the best evaluated procedure. The number of therapies which treat tinnitus is exceptionally high and makes clear, that the search for "the" tinnitus therapy is still going on. According to the current knowledge tinnitus genesis is multifactorial and therefore there can't be any standard therapy for tinnitus. The following seven categories can be distinguished: AD 1: MACHINE-AIDED ACOUSTIC THERAPIES From many studies regarding machine-aided acoustic therapy of tinnitus only two showed an evidence degree that allows scientifically correct statements about the effectiveness of these procedures. Selectively significant improvements could be shown in the comparison with a placebo (apparatus switched off) a superiority of tinnitus-maskers. AD 2: ELECTROSTIMULATION In an application study of electro-stimulation the results were not evaluated statistically, but it was described descriptively that a successful medical treatment can be expected in about 50% of the cases. AD 3: PSYCHOLOGICAL THERAPY PROCEDURES Hypnosis did not show positive effectiveness. With regard to biofeedback it can be concluded that this method can be effective in individual cases, however regarded as unreliable from missing reproducibility. Neurobiofeedback could prove that it had a positive therapeutic effect. From eight controlled studies to relaxation techniques and cognitive behaviour therapy four studies showed a therapeutic effectiveness and four failed. Combined therapies proved generally to be more effective than individual types. The behaviour medical psychotherapy could show a positive therapy effect. In a study with cognitive therapy and relaxation (three groups, a passive relaxation, an active relaxation and a cognitive therapy) short-term successes could be stated (for one month), however, the parameters of success returned on the initial value after four months. Also only coincidental and short-term successes could be achieved with cognitive behaviour therapy training, autogenic training and structured group psychotherapy. AD 4: TINNITUS RETRAINING THERAPY (TRT) Unfortunately, the published results of the TRT are methodically frequently bad and scientific of a poor value. Many of the studies presented until now regarding tinnitus retraining therapy are not informative in their scientific context. In a study with 95 patients with a chronic tinnitus TRT could show a significant, more than six months lasting stable success by comparison to a combination of TET with group behaviour therapy (improvement be achieved around at least ten points in the tinnitus questionnaire (TF)). AD 5: PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES Rheological drugs (medicines for hemodilution) could not show any statistically significant effect in the treatment of tinnitus. Studies to the medical treatment with tocainides (lidocaine) showed repeatable positive effects on tinnitus in higher dosages (as of 1.2 mg/day). Lamotrigine as a medicine had an effect positively only at with a small fraction of patients. Two studies with GABA receptor agonists could not prove therapeutic effects for tinnitus. Undesired side-effects were observed. Injections with Carvoverine (a glutamate antagonist) achieved significantly successes with a special form of tinnitus, the "Cochlear-synaptic tinnitus (CST)". A tricyclic antidepressant (Amitriptilin) could prove superiority against placebo. This effect could be confirmed in another study. However Clonazepame (a benzodiazepine), could not achieve any improvement. Short-term improvements were achieved with other benzodiazepines (Clonazepame, Diazepam, Flurazepame, Oxacepame and Alprazolame). A German retrospective study suggests a graded pharmacological therapy by means of rheological infusion therapy, applications of neurotransmitters, and injections of lidocaine. This method achieved a disappearance or a recovery of the complaints at 95.3% of the acute and 26.7% of the chronic cases. AD 6: SURGICAL PROCEDURES The effects of the operative excision of the stapes (stapedectomy) showed significant effects concerning tinnitus. This method is a routine operation to recover hearing, effects on tinnitus were observed only coincidently. There are generally high frequencies of improvements of tinnitus after cochlea implantations; however the risk of deterioration is present with this method. AD 7: OTHER AND ALTERNATIVE THERAPY PROCEDURES The hyperbaric oxygen therapy can be considered successful after acute events with tinnitus. The therapy should be started in the first month after appearance of the tinnitus. The methods transcranial-, electromagnetic and transcutaneous nerve stimulations did not show any significant effects on tinnitus. Also low laser medical treatment showed disappointing effects. The "pneumatic external contra-pulsation" is described as an unproblematic usable procedure by the authors of the examination, but 10% of the patients had to stop the medical treatment because of complications associated with the medical treatment. Acupuncture showed significant improvements in comparison to medical treatment. The effectiveness of this therapy could not be reproduced in another study. Five other studies between 1993 and 1999 also did not show any therapeutic effect of this method. Gingko-Biloba preparations did not show any positive effects in large-scale studies on tinnitus., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION</ovid:b>: Neither the diagnostic procedures nor the therapeutic methods or the individual therapies reach a usual scientific level in medicine. Unsolved problems concerning insurance, economic as well as legal problems have resulted for the patients and for caring stuff from this unsatisfactory situation. Numerous competitive tinnitus emergence models led to an incredible creativity in trying out different therapy approaches. No convergence of the therapy procedures can be seen within the last decades of tinnitus research, contrariwise there is always more and more "creativity" of new approaches. Priority has to be given to find the cause of tinnitus since therapies are a consequence of a better understanding of these symptoms that evidence oriented investigations on an usual scientific level can be started., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The innumerable therapeutic approaches, seeming completely incoherent to their effects should be coordinated on the meaningfulness, on the success parameters and with patient safety in light of the most plausible explanation models for non-specific chronic Tinnitus. To this the facilities of competence centres or related science- directing facilities are recommendable. Examinations which are carried out also with small numbers show often methodical insufficiencies. It is necessary that minimal requirements on a scientifically clinical experiment, such as design, case number calculation, analytic statistics, control group, are fulfilled. It is recommendable, that further research has to be promoted regarding tinnitus causes that a coordinated evidence-orientated treatment will be developed.

N2  - The objective of this study was to report and discuss the management of chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) following cochlear implantation in children. The study was a retrospective review of 650 patients receiving an implant at two paediatric tertiary referral centres for cochlear implantation. Nine patients were identified who developed CSOM following cochlear implantation (incidence 1.38%). The mean time interval between implantation and symptom development was 3.66 years (range 2-8 years) and the mean time interval between implantation and CSOM surgery was 5.02 years (range 2.2-8 years). All patients presented with otorrhoea and/or abscess formation over the implant site. Two patients underwent a modified radical mastoidectomy and seven underwent a combined approach tympanoplasty, three of whom required posterior canal wall reconstruction with cortical bone and one with cartilage. In four cases it was possible to remove the cholesteatoma without removing the implant. All but two patients were fitted with a contralateral implant. In the explanted ears the cochlear implant electrode was cut at the cochleostomy site, which was then covered with muscle. Chronic suppurative otitis media following cochlear implantation may occur either as a result of a posterior canal wall defect related to surgery or possibly de novo. Attempts should be made to save the implant, but explantation with reimplantation of the contralateral ear may be the only option. In these cases the intracochlear part of the electrode array should be left in situ to facilitate possible future reimplantation. Surgical options for management of CSOM should be individualized and may include both canal-wall up and canal-wall down techniques. To reduce the incidence of CSOM following implantation the authors recommend: (1) prompt treatment and careful follow-up of patients with a history of otitis media with effusion, (2) avoidance of excessive thinning of the posterior canal wall during mastoidectomy and (3) reconstruction of any accidental trauma to the annulus or posterior canal wall during posterior tympanotomy.

N2  - The objective of this prospective study was to compare two methods of predicting the level of hearing benefit following reconstructive middle ear surgery, namely Glasgow benefit plot and Belfast rule of thumb. The correlation of hearing benefit as measured by using these methods was also compared with patient's self-assessment of his/her hearing status. Sixty patients undergoing middle ear reconstructive surgery were studied. Hearing status was assessed pre and post operatively by pure tone audiometry and self-assessment by patient with a questionnaire. The accuracy of predictability of hearing benefit by the two methods was compared with the patient's own assessment. Relevant literature on the subject is reviewed.

N2  - Bone reconstruction is still a matter of concern in middle ear surgery despite the large number of surgical techniques proposed. Combination of biphasic calcium phosphate bioceramics with human fibrin sealant forms a moldable material easy to apply for bone reconstruction. Since 1986, we have been using this composite for reconstruction of mastoid cavities during chronic otitis media surgery. Granules of ceramic provide immediate mechanical stability and later on, promote osseoinduction when fibrin sealant forms a strong bond between granules enhancing the wound healing process. After checking feasibility, efficacy and tolerance through a controlled study on dogs by filling mastoid cavities, we started a clinical series comprising yet 66 mastoid reconstructions. A retrospective data analysis on 63 patients with an average follow up of 42 months including 12 histological controls confirms the stability of bone reconstruction with a remarkable tolerance of the skin in contact. Biopsies confirmed progressive replacement of material by lamellar newly formed bone. Mastoid cavities have a randomed shape making complex bone reconstruction procedure and their filling by the composite constitutes an easy way and represents a highly satisfactory procedure. The authors considered that this should be explored in other indications of bone surgery.

N2  - Objective To improve the techniques required to perform a stapedotomy without prosthesis (stapedioplasty). Study Design New infrared lasers were evaluated for potential use in otological surgery in guinea pigs. A prospective human trial of 34 primary stapes operations using the Argon ion laser was performed, with 11 stapedioplasties and 23 conventional stapedotomies as controls. Methods Laser-tissue interactions were evaluated for temporal bone and live guinea pig tissues, measuring crater histology and labyrinthine temperature elevations. Patients undergoing stapedioplasty had Argon ion laser cuts with endoscopic assistance made in the anterior crus and footplate to mobilize the posterior segment of the stapes while the anterior portion remained fixed. Results Diode laser (808-nm) vaporization craters and temperature elevations in the vestibule were suitable for clinical use. Overall, stapedioplasty patients' hearing was improved with air-bone gap closure to a mean of 8.3 dB (SD +/- 9.8 dB). Conclusions Patients with anterior footplate otosclerosis are candidates for stapedioplasty preserving the annular ring and stapes tendon and eliminating prosthesis complications. High-resolution small endoscopes, coupled with Argon ion or diode lasers promise to improve stapes visualization, enhancing the ability to perform minimally invasive surgery on the stapes footplate.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2000 The Triological Society.

N2  - Pulsed infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) lasers have been suggested for use in middle ear surgery due to potential fiberoptic delivery, decreased thermal trauma and precise ablation characteristics. Although attention has been focused on the thermal and photoacoustic events that occur during pulsed laser ablation of hard tissue, there are few studies which evaluate the acoustic energy generated from these devices from an audiological standpoint. In this study, the mastoid cavities of cadaveric human temporal bones were irradiated with a holmium: yttrium aluminium garnet (Ho:YAG) laser (lambda=2.12 microm) using the following parameters: 5, 10, and 15 Hz pulse repetition rate and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 W average power. During ablation, acoustic measurements were made using a sound level meter positioned 5 cm away from the target site. With each set of laser parameters, the sound intensity exceeded 85 dB (dBA scale). Peak intensities of 125 dB were measured, and a saturation effect noted above 4 W or 500 mJ/pulse. The clinical significance of these findings is discussed and the acoustical aspects of middle ear function and noise trauma are reviewed.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: The bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) uses the system of osseointegration described by Branemark. It is a well-established mode of treatment and many studies show the audiological benefit, but none have assessed the benefit to the quality of life of patients who underwent this surgical intervention. This study uses the validated Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) to quantify the changes in quality of life. The GBI is a specific patient-orientated questionnaire designed to look at the changes in health status secondary to an ORL intervention.1 The GBI gives an overll scorek, but also subscores of general, social and physical benefits. <ovid:br/>METHOD: Sixty consecutive BAHA patients were enrolled in the study. The male: female ratio was 1 : 26, with a mean age of 45 years. The most common indication was hearing loss secondary to mastoid disease/surgery followed by congenital atresia and chronically discharging ear. The mean bone conduction of the better ear was 19 dB and the mean conductive loss across the speech frequencies was 58 dB. Only patients who were fitted with the classic model were included in the study. <ovid:br/>RESULTS: The response rate was > 70%, which is high and adds weight to the results. The general benefit score was + 40 which is comparable to middle ear surgery, but just below benefit from chochlear implantation. The social benefit was + 27 with only + 10 for the physical score. This pattern mirrors that reported for other ear interventions. CONCLUSION : This paper is the first to demonstrate that there is significant quality of life benefit from BAHA surgical intervention as measured by the GBI.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To conduct a survey of the antiseptic preparations used for ear surgeries among otolaryngologists in Canada., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: An electronic survey was sent to active members of the Canadian Society of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery via e-mail. Questions included the use of antiseptic, choice of preparation solution, duration of preparation, use of a barrier method, and compliance with hospital protocol changes., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The e-mail was received by 253 otolaryngologists, and 85 completed the survey. Four of 85 respondents did not perform tympanoplasty surgery and were not included in the analysis. Of those who performed tympanoplasty (n = 81), 78 of the 81 respondents (96%) used an antiseptic preparation solution at surgery, whereas 3 respondents (4%) did not. Sixty-six of the 77 respondents (86%) used aqueous povidone-iodine, 4 (5%) used a chlorhexidine-based preparation, 3 (4%) used an alcohol-based solution, 3 (4%) used others, and 1 answered "I don't know." Thirty-eight of 75 (29%) respondents used a barrier method, 23 (31%) answered "always," 18 (24%) answered "sometimes," and 5 (7%) answered "I don't know." When asked if they would comply with a hypothetical hospital policy to use chlorhexidine in ear surgery, 15 of 79 (19%) respondents agreed, whereas 64 (81%) disagreed. Among the aqueous povidone-iodine users (n = 66), 7 (11%) agreed to change to chlorhexidine., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: There is a wide variation in practice in the use of surgical preparation solution among otolaryngologists performing ear surgery. Surgeons must be vigilant to avoid ototoxicity. A national society consensus on appropriate preparation solutions for ear surgery would minimize patients' risk and minimize future medicolegal actions.

N2  - The authors report the results of surgical treatment of 37 patients (42 ears) presenting with chronic perforating otitis media and grade I-III mucositis. All the patients were treated by differential atticoanthrotomy with type 1 tympanoplasty. Most of them suffered seriously disturbed ventilation and drainage functions of the Eustachian tube. Mean bone conduction and air conduction audibility thresholds for the voice frequency (0.5-2 kHz) prior to surgery were 12.5 +/- 6.7 and 12.0 +/- 4.2, 14.2 +/- 4.6 and 45.1 +/- 11.7 dB, 46.2 +/- 8.4 and 58.4 +/- 8.6 dB, respectively. Large defects of the tympanic membrane necessitated the use of a composite flap (autofascia and autocartilage) as the tympanic membrane autograft. Excellent survival of the tympanic autograft was documented in 33 (78.6%) patients. The remaining 9 patients had perforations in the neotympanic membrane of different size. Mean bone conduction and air conduction audibility thresholds for the voice frequency upon discharge from the clinic were 14.3 +/- 4.2, 14.0 +/- 4.4, 16.2 +/- 4.2 and 35.9 +/- 12.4 dB, 36.2 +/- 10.4, 46.6 +/- 8.2 dB, respectively. The functional outcome of the surgical treatment further improved in half a year due to the fact that the sound-conducting system acquired a higher rigidity (mean audibility thresholds for air conduction became 32.6 +/- 8.4, 34.0 +/- 6.8, and 42.2 +/- 8.4 dB. Audibility thresholds for bone conduction remained practically unaltered compared with their vales upon discharge from the clinic.

T1  - Tympanoplasty: is exposure adequate for otorhinolaryngology residents in Nigeria?.
A1  - Adobamen, P R O C
Y1  - 2011//
N2  - <ovid:b>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This study is aimed at identifying the extent of exposure of residents to tympanoplasty procedure during their training in Otorhinolaryngology (ORL) and proffer ways of improving such exposure., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Questionnaire assessing the exposure to tympanoplasty procedures was administered to ORL residents who were randomly selected from six teaching hospitals in Nigeria., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Twenty five residents from six teaching hospitals answered the questionnaire. The residents had varied duration of training from 11 months to 6years. Forty eight per cent (12 out of 25) of the residents had exposure to tympanoplasty, while only twenty per cent (5) had assisted at tympanoplasty procedure, and none had ever performed the procedure. The causes of poor practical exposure to tympanoplasty were identified as absence of necessary equipment and lack of expertise in the training centres. Ninety-two (23) per cent rated the low exposure to tympanoplasty procedure as moderate to gross omission in the ORL fellowship training. Eighty seven per cent of the respondents advocated provision of equipment and posting to centres with facilities as a way of solving this problem. All the residents indicated willingness to train in tympanoplasty procedures in Nigeria or overseas., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: ORL residents are poorly exposed to tympanoplasty procedures in Nigeria. The need to train residents in this procedure in centres with facilities for better ORL services is hereby stressed.

N2  - <ovid:b>UNLABELLED</ovid:b>: Stapedotomies are performed with the aid of surgical microscopes. However, the microscope has some limitations and may cause complications such as damage to the chorda tympani nerve. There are just a few cases and no series published on the use of sino-nasal endoscopes in stapedotomies., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: a) To investigate the feasibility of using sino-nasal endoscopes in stapedotomies, focusing on the visualization of important structures. b) To show initial results, discuss possible advantages and disadvantages of this instrument., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: 15 patients with otosclerosis were selected to undergo stapedotomies in 2010. The data and surgery videos were analyzed retrospectively (study case series). The anatomical conditions of the oval window niche and surgical steps were described and used to assess possible benefits of such procedures., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The surgeries were performed with endoscopes only and all relevant anatomical structures were visualized without difficulty. No complications were observed and 14 of the 15 patients reported improvement of their hearing, confirmed by postoperative audiological tests., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Totally endoscopic stapes surgeries are technically feasible, safe and promising. In this small series, the main advantages were: virtually no trauma to the chorda tympani nerve and excellent vision. The disadvantages were the lack of stereoscopic vision, having to work with one hand only and the learning curve.

N2  - This study was undertaken to assess dysgeusia in patients who have undergone middle ear surgery for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) when the surgeon's practice was to cleanly divide the chorda tympani without prior manipulation, if it in any way hindered operative access or the aims of surgery. We wanted to determine whether lower rates of taste disturbance might be obtained by early, clean division of the nerve. We followed 110 patients prospectively and asked them to complete a postoperative dysgeusia questionnaire 1 year after surgery. The "cut nerve" group included 81 patients, and the "uncut nerve" group included 29 patients. In the uncut group, the nerve was untouched or underwent minimal handling. In the cut nerve group, 68% of patients had no taste disturbance after surgery; 4% of patients in this group had ongoing symptoms at 1 year postoperatively. In the uncut nerve group, 67% were asymptomatic, while 11% had ongoing taste disturbance at 1 year. Statistical analysis of symptoms beyond 1 year showed a mean difference of 7%, but this is not statistically significant (p = 0.38). These results suggest that early division of the chorda tympani without prior manipulation in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media does not result in higher rates of taste disturbance than in patients with uncut nerves. Indeed rates of taste disturbance in our cut group were lower than in the uncut group, and lower than or comparable to those seen in other studies.

N2  - The training of microsurgical motor skills is essentiell for surgical education if the interests of the patient are to be safeguarded. In otosurgery the complex anatomy of the temporal bone and variations necessitate a special training before performing surgery on a patient. We therefore developed and evaluated a simplified middle ear model for acquiring first microsurgical skills in tympanoplasty. The simplified tympanoplasty model consists of the outer ear canal and a tympanic cavity. A stapes model is placed in projection of the upper posterior tympanic membrane quadrant at the medial wall of the simulated tympanic cavity. To imitate the annular ligament flexibility the stapes is fixed on a soft plastic pad. 41 subjects evaluated the model's anatomical analogy, the comparability to the real surgical situation and the general model properties the using a special questionnaire. The tympanoplasty model was very well evaluated by all participants. It is a reasonably priced model and a useful tool in microsurgical skills training. Thereby, it closes the gap between theoretical training and real operation conditions.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: This work aimed to analyse the mean arterial blood pressure (MBP) and heart rate (HR) in patients who underwent laryngological surgery within the preoperative, perioperative and postoperative periods., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The study covered 502 patients, including 209 women and 293 men, aged 18-85, who were divided into 6 groups according to the type of surgery: I - FESS (Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery), II - septoplasty, III - endoscopic re-operation of the paranasal sinuses, IV - microlaryngoscopy, V - tonsillectomy, VI - middle ear surgery. Only the patients with BP below 140/90 mmHg and maximum class 2 in the ASA scale were qualified for the surgical procedure. On admission, the arterial blood pressure was measured and diagnostic investigations like FBC, blood grouping determination, coagulogram, ESR, CRP and imaging studies were performed in each patient. Every operation was conducted under TIVA. BT and HR were monitored during an operation as well as through the four following hours in a recovery room., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The youngest group of patients with chronic palatine tonsillitis showed the lowest pressure values while the oldest studied group consisted of patients who were operated due to chronic otitis media and this group demonstrated the highest BP values. The patients with treated or untreated hypertension should be pharmacologically normalised by an anaesthesiologist. However, considerable lowering of BP can often be not possible, contrary to the patients with normal BP., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The own experience indicates that perioperative lowering of BP, including hypotension, ought to be avoided in cardiology patients. The postoperative BP raise, usually accompanied by pain, was noticed in the own studies. Therefore, effective analgesic treatment should be implemented in a recovery room.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2011 Polish Otolaryngology Society.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND/AIMS</ovid:b>: To evaluate the surgical outcome of tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesterol granuloma of the middle ear in post-irradiated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Nine post-irradiated NPC patients diagnosed with cholesterol granuloma in a single-sided middle ear were included in this study. The time from radiotherapy termination to surgery ranged from 6 to 14 years (median 9 years). All patients underwent radical tympanoplasty with canal wall down or up mastoidectomy., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All the patients with NPC received radiotherapy of 68-75 Gy before surgery. Three ears underwent tympanoplasty with canal wall down mastoidectomy, and 6 ears underwent tympanoplasty with canal wall up mastoidectomy. All the patients were followed up for at least 2 years. Seven ears (77.8%) had an intact tympanic membrane and 2 ears developed re-perforation of the eardrum 3 months after surgery, but otorrhea decreased significantly. All these patients reported improved quality of life after surgery. Before the operation, the pure tone averages (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 kHz) were 90.5 dB and the air-bone gaps (0.5, 1, 2 kHz) were 45.8 dB (vs. 62.3 and 25.5 dB, respectively, at 6 months after the operation)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Most post-irradiated NPC patients with cholesterol granuloma of the middle ear benefit from this surgery. Chronic otitis media caused by radiotherapy is not a contraindication to tympanoplasty.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To describe an active auditory rehabilitation method (clip vibroplasty) for conductive or mixed hearing loss in cases of a preserved stapes superstructure., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: After temporal bone experiments, the new clip vibroplasty was clinically used in 4 patients with chronic otitis media., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: A new titanium double clip device (clip vibroplasty) was developed for a standardized and effective coupling of the floating mass transducer of the Vibrant Soundbridge to the intact stapes. Temporal bone experiments using laser Doppler vibrometry were performed to evaluate the device's acoustic efficiency. The audiologic outcomes of the first 4 patients were analyzed. The subjective benefits and satisfaction were assessed using the standardized International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids in all patients., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Transfer characteristics of laser Doppler vibrometry experiments; audiologic outcomes of the 4 patients., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In the temporal bone experiment, coupling of the FMT using the titanium double clip support produced transfer characteristics across all tested frequencies comparable to our former total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis or an optimal round window application. The intraoperative application of the clip vibroplasty was uneventful in all cases. No signs of prosthesis dislocation were noted within the follow-up period of approximately 12 months. The audiologic outcome of the first patients showed good hearing gain in pure-tone and speech audiometry, with results that are unobtainable using a conventional air conduction hearing aid., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The concept of a partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis vibroplasty using a titanium clip support entails a straightforward procedure similar to a classic partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis tympanoplasty. The unoccluded ear canal and the superior auditory performance offer an advantageous application of this "power clip" in cases of chronic middle ear dysfunction.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Among other difficulties, achieving a stable position of a total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) is demanding because of a limited view on the TORP-footplate interface and individual angles between the footplate and tympanic membrane. The Kurz Omega Connector aims at a simplified insertion of the TORP. The performance of total ossicular reconstruction using the Omega Connector was evaluated., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective cohort study and experimental measurements with a fresh human temporal bone., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Seventeen consecutive patients receiving total ossicular reconstruction were included. Historical control group composed of 36 patients., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Total ossicular reconstruction using the Omega Connector., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: (a) Handling of the TORP and Omega Connector intraoperatively, (b) functional short-term results compared with a historical control group, (c) sound transmission properties with 3 different connective positions between the TORP and the Omega Connector., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Placing the Omega Connector on the footplate and coupling the Omega Connector to the TORP was straightforward in 65% of cases. A stable final position of the TORP was obtained in 88% of cases. Mean (SD) preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps were 36.00 (11.05) and 25.29 (12.25) dB and were almost identical with those in the historical control group (p = 0.9). In the experimental measurements, functional outcomes with "partial connection" showed almost the same results as those with "full connection.", <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The Omega Connector provides easy handling of the TORP. The short-term functional results were comparable to those achieved previously without the Omega Connector. The temporal bone measurement supports tolerance in connective position between the TORP and the Omega Connector.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is frequently associated with symptoms of inflammation like discharge from the ear or pain. In many cases, patients suffer from hearing loss causing communication problems and social withdrawal. The objective of this work was to collect prospective audiological data and data on general and disease-specific quality of life with validated quality of life measurement instruments to assess the impact of the disease on health-related quality of life (HR-QOL)., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: 121 patients were included in the study. Patients were clinically examined in the hospital before and 6 months after surgery including audiological testing. They filled in the quality of life questionnaires SF-36 and Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15) pre-operatively and 6 and 12 months post-operatively, respectively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Complete data records from 90 patients were available for statistical analysis. Disease-specific HR-QOL in patients with CSOM improved after tympanoplasty in all the scales of the COMOT-15. There was no difference in HR-QOL assessment between patients with mesotympanic respectively epitympanic CSOM. However, we did find the outcome to be worse in patients who received revision surgery compared with those receiving primary surgery. Audiometric findings correlated very well with the subscale hearing function from the COMOT-15 questionnaire. General HR-QOL measured with the SF-36 was not significantly changed by tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Tympanoplasty did lead to a significant improvement of disease-specific HR-QOL in patients with CSOM while general HR-QOL did not change. Very well correlations were found between the subscale hearing function from the COMOT-15 questionnaire and audiological findings. Revision surgery seems to be a predictor for a worse outcome.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common complication after middle ear surgery. We have aimed to compare the administration of a subhypnotic dose of propofol with dexamethasone 4 mg or 8 mg and placebo in prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: This clinical research was performed at Yuksek Ihtisas Hospital Kirikkale. The study included 105 adult patients scheduled for a middle ear operation. The patients were randomly assigned into three groups. The patients in Group I received propofol in a dose of 0.5 mg x kg(-1) plus 4 mg of dexamethasone while Group II was administered with propofol in a dose of 0.5 mg x kg(-1) plus 8 mg of dexamethasone, and Group III was given 0.9% saline solution. Within the framework of the study we evaluated the number of patients suffering from nausea and vomiting at 0-4, 4-12, and 12-24 hours postoperatively, and the necessity to use additional antiemetics., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The comparison of data showed that at up to four hours, the incidence of vomiting was 28.6% in Group 1, 22.9% in Group II, and 65.7% in Group III. The incidence rates in Group I and Group II were significantly lower than that in Group III (p < 0.05), while the rate of antiemetic drug usage was higher in Group III than in Group I and Group II (p < 0.05). The Nausea Vomiting Scale scores were also significantly higher in Group III than in Group I and Group II (p < 0.05). There were no significant differences between the values at 4-12 and 12-24 hours., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The administration of a subhypnotic dose of propofol plus 4 mg of dexamethasone at the end of surgery was found to be at least as effective as propofol plus 8 mg of dexamethasone in preventing the PONV in the early postoperative period in adult patients undergoing middle ear surgery (Tab. 4, Ref. 34).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Quality-of-life issues related to chronic otitis media (COM) include physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, hearing loss, speech symptoms, social symptoms, and parents' emotional symptoms. In this study we evaluated the effects of tympanoplasty on the quality of life of pediatric patients., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: In a questionnaire-based outcome study, we reviewed 56 of 78 pediatric patients with COM who were treated with type I tympanoplasty at our institution between December 2008 and February 2010. All patients were asked to fill out the COM-5 questionnaire with their parents, before operation and 6 months after operation. Preoperative and postoperative total ear scores, preoperative and postoperative ear scores with an intact tympanic membrane, preoperative and postoperative ear scores with a perforated tympanic membrane, and preoperative and postoperative audiological results were assessed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: After type I tympanoplasty, 45 patients (80.3%) had successful closure of the tympanic membrane, but 11 patients (19.7%) had unsuccessful closure of the tympanic membrane. There was a significant decrease in physical suffering, hearing loss, emotional distress, activity limitations, and caregiver's concerns scores in patients with intact tympanic membranes after operation (p < 0.01)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Children with COM had a significant increase in their quality of life after successful tympanoplasty. Our results also suggested that tympanoplasty was successful in pediatric patients with COM.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: We aimed to clarify the postoperative morphology of the fungiform papillae (FP) of the tongue in patients who recovered gustatory function after the chorda tympani nerve was severed during middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Fifty-four patients with normal preoperative gustatory function measured by electrogustometry (EGM) were included. The proximal and distal stumps of the severed nerves were re-adapted or re-approximated during surgery to promote regeneration of the nerve. The EGM thresholds over 2 years after surgery were compared with preoperative values. At the same time, the morphological characteristics of the FP in the midlateral region of the tongue were recorded with a digital microscope., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: One month after surgery, EGM showed no response in any patients. At a time point of more than 2 years, the FP showed complete atrophy and no response to EGM on the surgical side in 21 of the 54 patients. In 16 patients who showed complete recovery of the EGM threshold (below 20 microA), the FP showed an almost normal appearance, and the mean number of FP was 77.5% (10 +/- 4.1 papillae per square centimeter) of that on the contralateral side (12.9 +/- 4.9 papillae per square centimeter; p > 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The morphology of the FP was maintained in patients who recovered gustatory function after the chorda tympani nerve was severed. Because the results indicate regeneration of the taste buds, further observation is needed to detect regenerated taste buds in the FP.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to compare the effects of low-flow sevoflurane and low-flow sevoflurane supplemented with remifentanil anesthesia on the recovery time, consumption amount of the anesthetic drugs and hemodynamic differences., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A prospective, randomized and double-blinded study with 50 patients was designed. Following intubation, group S received sevoflurane 1.8 vol%, oxygen, nitrous oxide at 4 l . min(-1) and normal saline continuous infusion; group SR received sevoflurane 1.2 vol%, oxygen, nitrous oxide at 4 l . min(-1) and 0.25 mug . kg(-1) . min(-1) remifentanil continuous infusions. Ten minutes after intubation the flow rates decreased to 1 l . min(-1). Consumption of each drug, postoperative recovery characteristics and visual analog scale (VAS) scores for pain were recorded., <ovid:b>RESULT</ovid:b>: There were no significant differences in hemodynamic parameters, tramadol consumption and VAS scores for pain. The patients in group SR showed faster early recovery as compared to group S. The mean consumption of sevoflurane was 18 ml in group SR, while it was 25 ml in group S., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Low-flow sevoflurane anesthesia combined with remifentanil regimen in patients undergoing tympanoplasty surgery resulted in a faster early recovery and decreased sevoflurane consumption.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2011 S.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To present power stapes, stapedotomy, and middle ear implantation with Vibrant SoundBridge (VSB) performed in a one-step surgery as an alternative option for hearing rehabilitation in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI)., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective case series., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral ear center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: A family with genetically proven OI Type I., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Two patients, mother and son, with severe to profound mixed hearing loss underwent 3 power stapes, 1 unilateral and 1 bilateral sequential., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Thorough audiological diagnostic batteries including aided and unaided pure-tone and free-field audiometry and Freiburg monosyllabic word test were used to assess the preoperative status and the postoperative hearing outcome. High-resolution computed tomography of the temporal bones was performed as well. Surgical procedure and any special considerations were analyzed in detail., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The hearing outcome was favorable in all cases, showing in comparison to the preoperative values an average improvement of 36.8 dB. Severe intraoperative bleeding of the middle ear mucosa was the only complication and could be easily controlled by allowing short time intervals. Inner ear trauma did not occur in any case., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Power stapes represents a safe and promising procedure for treating hearing loss in selected patients with OI. Furthermore, it introduces a new, advantageous VSB application in cases of mixed hearing loss with severe otosclerosis and increased bone-conduction thresholds.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To describe a new titanium clip prosthesis for partial ossicular reconstruction with a micro ball joint in the headplate for compensation of tympanic membrane displacements., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Laboratory experiments followed by 18 consecutive patients., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: A micro ball joint was implemented into a headplate of titanium middle ear prosthesis. First, the new prosthesis was tested in the laboratory in temporal bone experiments. Second, the new prosthesis was clinically installed in 18 patients., <ovid:b>OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Results of laser Doppler vibrometry and force measurements in the laboratory experiments, analysis of a questionnaire, and preoperative and postoperative pure tone audiometry., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The frictional resistance in the joint was measured to be 12 mN that should allow for adequate mobility under physiologic conditions. The effective sound transmission of the prosthesis was demonstrated by laser Doppler vibrometry. Intraoperatively, the installation of the prosthesis was always straightforward with headplate prosthesis shaft angles between 60 and 90 degrees. Postoperatively, pure tone audiometry revealed satisfying hearing results with a remaining average air-bone gap of 18.2 dB over the frequencies 500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 Hz. No signs of prosthesis dislocation were discovered within the follow-up period of approximately 6 months., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The experimental data show that the new modified prosthesis headplate fulfills the requirements necessary for sound transmission. The joint allows the plate to follow movements of the tympanic membrane. This characteristic in conjunction with the proven clip design ensure for optimal prosthesis placement and effectiveness.

N2  - The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical features of tinnitus in patients with chronic otitis media (COM) and to evaluate changes in tinnitus following middle ear surgery in relation to audiologic outcome. Medical records were reviewed for 117 patients with COM who underwent middle ear surgery between March 2009 and March 2010. Of them, 44 patients who pre-operatively reported tinnitus on a tinnitus questionnaire and 28 patients who completed a tinnitus questionnaire 8 weeks after surgery were evaluated to determine the clinical characteristics of tinnitus in patients with COM and any change in tinnitus following middle ear surgery, respectively. New tinnitus symptoms that developed after surgery were also evaluated in previously asymptomatic patients. The pre-operative incidence of tinnitus in patients with COM was 43% (50/117), with 87% of these patients displaying sensorineural tinnitus. After middle ear surgery, tinnitus handicap inventory scores were reduced in 82% of patients (23/28). Mean values of loudness, annoyance, effect on life, and awareness of tinnitus were also significantly reduced. One patient displayed newly developed tinnitus after surgery. Analysis of the relationship between improvement in tinnitus and audiologic outcome demonstrated that the group of patients whose tinnitus handicap inventory was reduced by more than 10 showed significantly greater improvements in mean air-conduction thresholds than did patients in the other group. In conclusion, following middle ear surgery, most patients experienced a reduction in tinnitus and restored hearing, with surgery perceived as an important contributory factor.

N2  - <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The Esteem( R) device proved to offer beneficial results in subjects suffering from high frequency, severe bilateral sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and may be considered as an alternative procedure to conventional hearing aids (HAs) or electroacoustic stimulation (EAS) systems., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Since the Esteem( R) totally implantable device has been shown to offer positive results among patients with moderate SNHL, this middle ear implant has also been suggested for subjects with a worse degree of hearing loss in order to predict its extended application, also in the nearly cochlear implantation range., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Esteem( R) implantation was carried out in 21 subjects with a mild (n = 3), moderate (MHL, n = 9) or severe (SHL, n = 9) degree of SNHL. The two latter groups, i.e. MHL and SHL, were compared in terms of preoperative versus postoperative pure tone and speech reception thresholds (SRTs). Similarly, they were also compared for the outcome from quality of life (QoL) questionnaires, such as the general Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) and COSI., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In the whole sample, mean hearing threshold levels improved from 70 to 48 dB; in the MHL group the mean hearing threshold level improved from 64 to 42 dB; in the SHL group the mean hearing threshold level improved from 82 to 58 dB. GBI and COSI scores were only slightly better in the MHL group than in the SHL group.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Clinical and radiologic outcome analysis after petrous bone cholesteatoma (PBC) removal with simultaneous functional reconstruction., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective case review over an observation period of 16 years (1992-2007)., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: A total of 21 patients (17 adults and 4 children) with PBCs were included, accounting for 3.4% of all cholesteatoma cases (n = 621). The average follow-up duration was 7 years (range, 2-15 yr). In all patients, a modified subtotal petrosectomy was performed with simultaneous tympanoplasty, musculoplasty, and meatoplasty in 90%. In 2 patients (10%), the cavity was obliterated. Two others (10%) needed a simultaneous temporal craniotomy., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative findings including signs, classifications, recurrences, hearing, and facial nerve outcomes., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In the majority of patients (67%), a supralabyrinthine PBC was found. Complete macroscopic resection was achieved in all patients. During the follow-up period, 4 patients (19%) were identified as having recurrent disease. Hearing was postoperatively preserved in 14 of 17 patients with preoperative hearing (82%; 4 preoperative dead ears), of whom, 13 had functional hearing, with a mean pure-tone average of 37 dB (range, 15-55 dB). Preoperative facial nerve dysfunction completely resolved in 4 of 6 patients, and no new dysfunctions occurred postoperatively. All cavities became self-cleaning and dry., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Hearing preservation was feasible in the majority of patients with PBCs. The functional surgical concept and the high number of supralabyrinthine lesions seemed to be important prerequisites for the good functional outcomes observed.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Informed consent is a phrase often used in the law to indicate that the consent a person gives meets certain minimum standards. It relies on patients' ability to understand risk information. Evidence suggests that people may extract the gist of any risk information to make medical decisions. Existing evidence also suggests that there is an inverse relationship between the perception of risk and the perception of benefit. Informed consent is the method by which fully informed, rational persons may be involved in choices about their health care., <ovid:b>AIM</ovid:b>: The aims of this study were to study how much patients remember of the risks discussed with them about their otolaryngologic surgery and to evaluate whether a simple intervention, the addition of an information handout, improves their recall., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This was a prospective study carried out between January and December 2009 in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Ilorin teaching hospital. Fifty patients undergoing a variety of otorhinolaryngologic procedures, including mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, nasal polypectomy, rhinotomy, maxillectomy, and laryngoscopy, were verbally consented by the operating surgeon with a standard checklist of potential surgical complications and adverse effects. Three surgeons participated in the study. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: a higher education group and a lower education group. Within each group, patients were randomized to either a control group, consisting of a verbal explanation only, or an intervention group, which added a written handout to the verbal explanation. A follow-up telephone interview was conducted at an average of 20.6 days (range, 14-53 days) to survey for recall of the complications discussed. The main outcome measure is risk recall. This was analyzed by education level and written sheet intervention. Other parameters examined were patient demographics and time elapsed from when the consent was obtained., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of the 50 patients involved in the study, 30 were men and 20 were women, with male/female ratio of 1.5:1.0. The average age was 43 years (range, 16-76 years). With respect to educational status, 26 patients had the equivalent of high school or less (group 1), and 24 had some degree of postsecondary training (group 2). Overall recall of potential complications was 56%. Those who received the handout recalled 67% of the complications overall, whereas those who did not receive the handout remembered 51% of the complications. The difference was significant recall of the specific risks varied considerably. For those with potential risk of facial nerve paralysis, 88% of them recalled, which was the highest in the study. This was followed by hearing loss (85%) and nasal adhesion (23%). The least were anesthetic reactions (4%) and hoarseness (2%). Those who received the handout recalled 62% of the complications overall, whereas those who did not receive the handout remembered 51% the complications., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The addition of a handout significantly alters recall of potential complications of otorhinolaryngologic surgery with the recall of specific risk highest for facial nerve paralysis.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>UNLABELLED</ovid:b>: Cartilage has shown to be a promising graft material to close tympanic membrane perforations. However, due to its rigid quality, doubts are raised regarding its sound conduction properties. It has been suggested that acoustic benefit may be obtained by thinning the cartilage. We describe our innovative method for harvesting tragal cartilage from the same endaural incision and also describe preparation of the graft by slicing it. We present our 3-year experience of shield cartilage type 1 tympanoplasty using sliced tragal cartilage-perichondrium composite graft., <ovid:b>AIM</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to prove the success rate of our technique of shield cartilage tympanoplasty using sliced tragal cartilage graft in terms of functional and anatomic results., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective analysis of type 1 cartilage tympanoplasties using sliced tragal cartilage was carried out in MIMER Medical College and Sushrut ENT Hospital during May 2005 to January 2008 with a minimum follow-up of 2 years., <ovid:b>METHOD AND MATERIALS</ovid:b>: A total of 223 ears were operated by our technique., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The overall success rate of our technique was 98.20% in terms of perforation closure and air bone gap closure within 7.06 +/- 3.39 dB. The success rates in the various age group are as follows: 11 to 20 years, 97.67%; 21 to 40 years, 99.12%; and 41 to 60 years, 96.96%., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Our technique of type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty achieves good anatomic and functional results.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright &#xa9; 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: There is a marked diversity in the reported success rates for achieving an intact tympanic membrane following tympanoplasty. Controversy exists about the factors thought to influence surgical outcome. These facts have important implications for the selection of patients who would benefit the most. This study reviews the factors thought to determine the anatomical and functional success of tympanoplasty in children., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Retrospective study of the anatomical and functional results of 91 tympanoplasties performed in children. Age, gender, size and site of perforation, status of operated and contralateral ear, underlying cause of the perforations, surgical technique, pre-operative and post-operative hearing levels, post-operative follow-up time and post-operative complications were recorded. We divided our population into two groups according to the expected eustachian tube maturity (younger group (N=24): <=10 years old, older group (N=67): >10 years old). All patients were evaluated in terms of anatomical and functional outcome and complications., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Anatomical success was achieved in 85.7% and functional success was 76.9% after a mean follow-up of 25.6 +/- 17.1 months. Anatomical success (intact tympanic membrane) was achieved in 83% of younger vs 87% of older patients (p=n.s.). Functional (air bone gap closure) success was 75% in the younger group vs 78% in the older group (p=n.s.). There were no significant differences in post-operative gain at different frequencies (500, 1000, 2000 and 3000 Hz) between the two groups. A previous adenoidectomy in children older than 10 years seems to be an independent predictor of functional success The incidence of minor and major complications were 29% in patients aged <=10 and 21% in those older than 10 (p=n.s.). We report 12.9% minor post-operative complications in successful cases: injury to the chorda tympani nerve (5.7%), wound infection (2.9%), otitis externa (2.9%) and transient vertigo (1.4%). Among the 21 reperforations observed, 92.3% occurred before 1 year., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: This study shows that tympanoplasty is a valid treatment modality for tympanic membrane perforation in the pediatric population. A tympanic membrane perforation can be closed at any age. There is no age limit below which perforation should not be closed. A previous adenoidectomy in children older than 10 years seems to be an independent predictor of functional success.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright A&#xa9; 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Otosclerosis is an osteodystrophy disease of the bony labyrinth of the ear which leads to stapes fixation and to bradyecoia of a conductive type. The microsurgical treatment by the use of a stapes prosthesis provides hearing improvement and a reduction or disappearing of tinnitus. The aim of our study was to determine the hearing condition and tinnitus before and after the treatment of otosclerosis., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A hundred patients with otosclerosis, aged 20 to 70, were surgically treated at the Otorhinolaryngology Clinic and the Functional Diagnostics, Military Medical Academy, Belgrade. After the treatment, the audiometric examinations were performed in order to assess the hearing condition and tinnitus was assessed by a questionnaire. The subjective assessment of tinnitus was ranged as present, reduced or absent., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Before the treatment, hearing impairment was present in all the patients, while tinnitus was found in 91% of them. One year following the surgical treatment hearing improvement was found in 96% of the patients, and tinnitus cessation in 89% of them., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The surgical treatment can result in hearing improvement and cessation or reduction of tinnitus.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Clinical auditing is a systematic process for improving quality of care. The primary goal is to compare current practice with established standards. A common dataset enables the comparison of results, and takes into account the effect of case mix, surgical techniques and follow-up periods on outcome. The Common Otology Database (COD) is a joint effort of an international group of otologists to standardise reporting on middle ear surgery, including myringoplasty, ossiculoplasty, stapes surgery and cholesteatoma removal. It aims to identify audit data using the internet (http://www.ear-audit.net), provide a storage system for otological data, to create a prospective database allowing statistical analysis with sufficient power and to produce standards for comparative auditing., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The COD provides two levels of data entry, anonymising surgeon and patient data. Level 1 is designed for general otorhinolaryngologists and trainees, and only records main outcomes. Level 2 is designed for benchmark otologists and includes detailed information about pathologies, risk factors, aim of surgery, surgical findings, procedures, follow-up periods and complications. Level-2 surgeons are required to submit pre-operative data on all patients scheduled for surgery in order to eliminate bias as a result of selective reporting., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The COD began in January 2004 and is continuously including patients. In May 2009, 2,291 cases were entered in the level-2 benchmark database, including 1,218 myringoplasties (53.2%), 576 ossiculoplasties (25.1%), 695 stapes surgeries (30.3%) and 532 cholesteatoma surgeries (23.2%). Currently, 151 surgeons use the database system (levels 1 and 2 combined). Eighteen otologists were invited to contribute to the level 2 database. Eight contributors complied with the validation criteria. Others did not cooperate, citing a lack of resources to support data input, or their health system discouraging follow-up. Some were also reluctant to have their outcome data subjected to external validation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The COD has engaged the otological community to participate in a large-scale audit of current practice. The number of surgical procedures included has attained a level of power that will allow introductory statistical analysis.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To analyze the outcome of patients with chronic otitis media (COM) with an intact, but markedly medialized ossicular chain, treated by removing the malleus head and interposing an autologous incus and then an underlay myringoplasty., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective clinical study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: The search criteria within the prospective surgical database was COM with a central perforation (without cholesteatoma) with a markedly medialized malleus handle (the umbo adherent to the promontory) with an intact ossicular chain (study, n = 15) or an incus necrosis at the lenticular process (incus, n = 23). Only primary surgeries performed at our otorhinolaryngology department were included., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: All patients underwent the same surgical procedure consisting of an autologous incus interposition and underlay myringoplasty with temporalis fascia., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: The patients' audiological and follow-up data were retrieved from the database. The postoperative audiogram (0.5-3 kHz) with the longest follow-up was used., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The preoperative air-conduction thresholds were less impaired in the study group than in the incus group. After their surgery, all, except 3 patients, improved their hearing, and 97% had an intact tympanic membrane at a mean follow-up of 2 years. The air-bone gap was closed within 20 dB in 80% (study) and in 87% (incus), in one third of all patients even within 10 dB. Although the largest improvement was seen in the lower frequencies, closure of the air-bone gap at 4 kHz was difficult to achieve., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Patients presenting with COM, a (central) perforation, a medially rotated malleus and intact ossicular chain are a treatment challenge. Lateralizing the malleus handle may require disconnection of the ossicular chain and an autologous incus interposition to bring back the reconstructed tympanic membrane in its original position and improve the hearing.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Evaluation of morphologic and functional long-term results of palisade cartilage tympanoplasty (PCT) combined with titanium ossicular replacement prostheses., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective review of tympanoplasties., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Twenty-nine patients (12 women and 17 men; mean age, 39 yr; range, 17-72 yr) operated on more than 9 years ago (mean follow up, 9.1 yr) because of cholesteatoma, adhesive otitis, chronic otitis media, subtotal tympanic membrane defects, and tympanic fibrosis requiring tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Tympanoplasty, applying the PCT. For ossiculoplasty, total or partial titanium ossicular replacement prostheses were used., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Questionnaire on postoperative course, otoscopic findings, and hearing results using a 4-frequency pure-tone average air-bone gap., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A recurrent defect was not observed. The graft take rate was 100%. There was one case of prosthesis protrusion which required revision surgery and insertion of a shorter prosthesis. A pure-tone average air-bone gap of 0 to 10 dB was seen preoperatively in 1 ear, 11 to 30 dB in 16 ears, and 31 to 59 dB in 12 ears. Postoperatively, the corresponding numbers were 10, 15, and 4 ears., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The PCT is a reliable surgical method to manage difficult middle ear pathology on a long-term (>9 yr) basis. It offers satisfactory morphologic and functional results in combination with titanium prosthesis ossiculoplasty.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Some patients with chronic middle ear disease and multiple failed revisions, who also need a hearing aid, may benefit from an active middle ear implant. An advantage of an active middle ear implant is that the ear canal is unoccluded., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Following extensive experimental development in temporal bones and investigations of various locations and attachments of a Vibrant Soundbridge transducer, a new titanium clip holder for the vibrant floating mass transducer was developed. This assembly is a total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP) that is placed on the stapes footplate. Six patients were implanted with this device., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Acoustic results demonstrate significantly improved gain, especially in the high frequencies, which is typically unobtainable by conventional hearing aids., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The simple procedure of placing an active TORP assembly on the stapes footplate, similar to the implantation of a passive TORP prosthesis during tympanoplasty, offers promising treatment for cases of incurable middle ear disease.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright (c) 2010 S.

N2  - The aim of this work is to reexamine our experience with the treatment of conductive and mixed hearing loss using the Baha system. The system was implanted in 47 patients (16 adults and 31 children under the age of 14), bilaterally in two cases. The causes of hypoacusis were bilateral congenital aural atresia (31 patients), bilateral chronic otitis media or outcomes of middle-ear surgery (Gillett et al. in J laryngol Otol 120:537-542, 2006), and otosclerosis (Pazzaglia et al. in Acta Orthop Scand 54:574-579, 1983). The following parameters were assessed: mean preoperative air- and bone-conduction thresholds for the frequencies of 500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz; mean postoperative threshold with the Baha; hearing improvement calculated by subtracting the postoperative threshold with the Baha from the preoperative threshold for air conduction in the better ear; speech audiometry test; improvement in the quality of life, calculated using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory for the adult patients and the Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory for paediatric patients; frequency and type of surgical complications. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 38 months. The audiological results were satisfactory, with air-bone gap closure in 85.1% of cases. In terms of quality of life, assessment using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory showed a clear-cut improvement in health for all the 45 patients that answered to the questionnaires in our study. Out of the 49 operations that were performed, complications were reported in 3 cases (6.1%): 2 cases of skin regrowth around the titanium screw and one in which the abutment was not osseointegrated. The data from this study show that the Baha system offers a high percentage of success, which can significantly improve the patient's quality of life, and a low rate of complications.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Considerable progress has been made in the development of three-dimensional temporal bone virtual reality simulators. However, very little attention has been paid to interactive simulation of middle ear surgery, including myringotomy. As the development of technical skills for middle ear surgery has a steep learning curve, this poses inherent risks to patients during the skills acquisition phase. The benefit of simulation training in the acquisition of surgical skills has been demonstrated with previous low-fidelity models. Tactile sensation is an important feedback mechanism in middle ear surgery, so a three-dimensional virtual reality myringotomy simulator with haptic feedback was developed at The University of Western Ontario., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To examine the face validity of a three-dimensional myringotomy simulator with haptic feedback., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The three-dimensional myringotomy simulator was calibrated with input from two otolaryngologists and one intermediate-level resident. The face validity of the resulting simulator was tested by four staff otolaryngologists and seven intermediate- or senior-level residents using a previously validated questionnaire., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The results demonstrate good to excellent face validity for the myringotomy simulator with high consistency between participants with a Cronbach alpha of .919. Favourable responses predominated for all questions with the exception of force feedback, where the average response was neutral., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The initial results from the development and testing of a three-dimensional virtual myringotomy simulator with haptic feedback are very encouraging. This simulator is the first of its kind and, with further refinement, has excellent potential to be of benefit in the training of proficient middle ear surgeons.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Carbomethylcellulose (CMC) foam has been widely adopted to promote hemostasis and healing in sinus surgery. There has been interest in the use of CMC in middle ear surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CMC foam for use in middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective, controlled., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Academic research laboratory., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Adult guinea pigs underwent experimental tympanoplasty followed by packing of the middle ear (n = 19 per group) with CMC, hyaluronic acid (HA), or gelatin sponge (GS). Auditory evoked brainstem response testing and otomicroscopy were performed before and serially for eight weeks after surgery. Tympanic membrane healing, hemostasis, and retention of packing material were assessed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All tympanic membranes treated with CMC healed by week eight. Less postoperative bleeding was observed with CMC than with HA or GS. Surgery elevated auditory thresholds, at least temporarily, in all groups. However, CMC was associated with greater auditory threshold elevation (15-25 dB) at eight weeks across all test frequencies relative to HA or GS (P < 0.01). Residual CMC and scarring were not found in the middle ear, indicating that the hearing loss was sensorineural. No head tilt posturing suggestive of vestibulopathy was seen., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: CMC was associated with hearing loss and may be ototoxic. Therefore, CMC should not be used in human middle ears given the presence of several nontoxic alternative materials.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright 2010 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Auditory testing is not routinely performed within 4 to 6 weeks after stapedotomy because hearing acuity is thought to be transiently depressed. The early postoperative effects of the 1-shot carbon dioxide (CO2) laser have never been reported. The purpose of this study is to present data for auditory thresholds measured within 2 days of laser stapedotomy and at the last follow-up., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: The study was prospective and unblinded., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: The study was conducted at the "A. Gemelli" University Hospital., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: From January to December 2008, 58 subjects underwent "1-shot" CO2 laser stapedotomies for otosclerosis. Pure-tonal audiometric test was performed preoperatively 2 days after surgery and at least 1 month after surgery during the follow-up., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The closure of air-bone gap began in the early postoperative period and continued to improve through the late postoperative period. Bone-conduction hearing thresholds were stable even in the early postoperative follow-up and remained stable trough all the course of the study., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Our data, supported by the literature, suggest that 1-shot CO2 laser stapedotomy is an effective and safe procedure for the treatment of otosclerosis.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Tympanoplasty continues to pose a challenge in developing countries, where treatment cost and lack of compliance with second stage surgery are often important factors in determining the surgical strategy. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of the newly developed, 'umbrella' autograft., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: In 22 patients suffering chronic suppurative otitis media, in whom the incus and stapes suprastructure were found to be absent during surgery, reconstruction was achieved using cartilage-malleus umbrella graft assembly. Six-month post-operative results were evaluated on the basis of average hearing gain, measured at 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 kHz., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: At six months post-operatively, 77.3 per cent of patients showed hearing improvement. Audiography at this time indicated significant improvement (p < 0.001), suggesting that this hearing gain may stand the test of time., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Umbrella graft tympanoplasty appears to be a promising technique in terms of cost-effectiveness and the autologous nature of implant materials.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The purpose of this work was to report our modified cartilage plate tympanoplasty technique ("tulip leaves") and to analyze its clinical outcome in primary and recurrent cases of chronic otitis media with and without cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Clinical retrospective study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Patients being operated on with this technique at the University Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Dresden, Germany, between 1993 and 2001 were invited for survey, otomicroscopy, and pure-tone audiometry in 2003. Patients' charts were used to draw necessary conclusions., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A total of 39 patients who were treated with this technique after canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy and cavity obliteration were included in this long-term analysis after a median follow-up of 6 years. Seventeen patients (44%) experienced chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma, whereas 22 (56%) of them had a diagnosis of chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma. At the time of examination, all patients displayed a closed tympanic membrane. However, retractions were observed in 19 patients (48%). One patient required (3%) revision surgery for recurrent cholesteatoma due to prosthesis extrusion during the study period., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: On the basis of this study, we recommend the tuliplike arrangement of thin but large auricular cartilage slices for the reconstruction of tympanic membrane defects in high-risk ears. This combination proved its high stability and long-lasting vitality in our long-term study. These characteristics are crucial for permanent disease removal and for reducing the risk of recurrent pathologic abnormality.

N2  - Tympanosclerosis is a sequel of chronic otitis media characterized by the deposition of calcareous plaques following hyaline degeneration in the fibrous layer of the tympanic membrane and inside middle ear mucosa. It usually results from prior middle ear infections. In this study, results of treatment and clinical findings of the patients with tympanosclerosis are presented. Our objective is to determine the changes in middle ear caused by tympanosclerosis and intervene in the more problematic zone and find out the more useful treatment protocol for patients. Preoperative features, middle ear findings detected during surgery and postoperative hearing levels of the patients who were operated in our clinic between January 1996 and June 2006 due to tympanosclerosis were evaluated. Surgical treatment was performed on a total of 37 patients including 25 females and 12 males between ages of 11 and 71. Preoperative tympanic membranes perforations were presented at a rate of 91% and average airway bone gap was 37.8 dB. Bilateral involvement was present in 59%. Conductive-type hearing loss was present at a rate of 81%, whereas mixed-type hearing existed at a rate of 19%. Sclerotic plaques were most commonly localized in the attic with a rate of 72%. Post-op outcome was found to be 27% in the patients with air bone gap between 0-20 dB. The best hearing result belonged to type 1 patients. Cases in which stapes footplate was fixated had the worst result in terms of hearing. Teflon piston was only applied in one patient. Our tympanoplasty success was found to be 67%. The most common treatment method of tympanosclerosis is surgery. Stapedectomy is recommended in surgery instead of mobilization techniques. However, there is often recurrence and there is no curative treatment. Therefore rehabilitation with hearing device can be preferred as an adjunct. In the recent experimental studies, good results with topical or systemic agents have also been promising.

N2  - Cartilage is the grafting material of choice in advanced disorders of the middle ear while the indications for its routine use remain controversial due to the possible detrimental effect on post-operative hearing. Aim of the present study was to report personal experience with "tragal cartilage shield" tympanoplasty. The study focused on 306 adult patients (236 primary procedures and 70 revisions from January 2003 to June 2007). Mean post-operative follow-up was 37 months (range 1-66). The following parameters were evaluated: graft take, change between the pre- and post-operative pure-tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG), post-operative complications. Graft take was achieved in 304 patients (99.35%) and there were no immediate post-operative complications. The overall average pre-operative pure-tone average air-bone gap was 43.79 +/- 7.07 dB, whereas the post-operative (1 year after surgery) pure-tone average air-bone gap was 10.43 +/- 5.25 dB (p < 0.0001). Statistically significant improvement was observed up to 5 years after surgery. This study reveals that tragal cartilage shield tympanoplasty is a reliable technique, in fact it has a high degree of graft take and hearing results are satisfactory. Furthermore, the cartilage is a satisfactory grafting material because it is easily accessible, easy to adapt, resistant to negative middle ear pressures, stable, elastic, well tolerated by the middle ear, resistant to resorption. Therefore, we also recommend its use in less severe middle ear disorders, in which the functional outcome is more essential.

N2  - Tinnitus is a public health issue in France. Around 1% of the population is affected and 30,000 people are handicapped in their daily life. The treatments available for disabling tinnitus have until now been disappointing. We are reporting on the surgical treatment by electrical stimulation of the auditory cortex of a female patient affected by disabling tinnitus that resisted classical treatments. The tinnitus appeared suddenly 10 years ago after a left ear tympanoplasty. The acouphenometry measures revealed a bilateral tinnitus, predominant on the right side, constant, with high frequency (6000 Hz). Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed at first with several supraliminal and infraliminal protocols. This showed promising results. Anatomic and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the auditory cortex before and after repetitive TMS (rTMS) demonstrated a modification of the cortical activity and where the ideal location for a cortical electrode might be, to straddle primary and secondary auditory cortex. After these investigations, two quadra polar electrodes (Resume, Medtronic Ltd, Hertfordshire, UK), connected to a stimulating device implanted under the skin (Synergy, Medtronic Ltd), were extradurally implanted. The surgical procedure was similar to the one performed for analgesic cortical stimulation. No surgical complications were reported. The activation of the stimulator provided a reduction of 65% of the tinnitus impact, with a persistent effect on the right side. The feasibility of the cortical stimulation in symptomatic treatment of tinnitus was proven by this preparatory work. The middle- and long-term therapeutic effects remain to be evaluated.

T1  - Drop weld thermal injuries to the middle ear.

Y1  - 2009//
N2  - Drop weld injuries to the tympanic membrane and middle ear caused by hot sparks or molten slag are a rare but significant injury. Steel workers and welders who are regularly exposed to flying sparks and molten metal slag are predisposed. This type of transtympanic thermal injury occurs when the slag literally drops into the external auditory canal and burns through the tympanic membrane. A spectrum of severity of injury occurs which includes chronic tympanic membrane perforation, chronic otorrhoea, facial nerve injury and deafness. Chronic tympanic membrane perforation is the most common sequelae and is perhaps one of the most challenging of all perforations to repair The combination of direct thermal injury and foreign body reaction results in continuing or recurrent suppuration. The foreign body reaction is due to the embedding of metal slag in the promontorial mucosa. We present a case of drop weld injury to the left tympanic membrane, resulting in chronic middle ear inflammation, otorrhoea and tympanic perforation. CAT scan clearly demonstrated a metallic promontorial foreign body with localised bone erosion. We emphasise the importance of removing these foreign bodies and recommend a cartilage reinforced underlay tympanoplasty technique to repair these perforations. Transtympanic thermal trauma is a preventable occupational injury, which is best, avoided by earplugs and increased awareness.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: First, to assess for the performance of the Carina placed on the round window at various European centers; second, to study the follow-up after 2 years and discuss limitations and technical issues; and finally, to further develop our understanding of the principles of acoustic transfer through the round window., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Eleven patients were included in this retrospective study (7 women and 4 men) from 7 European tertiary referral hospitals (4 centers in France, 2 in Belgium, 1 in Spain). The mean age was 50.8 years (35-71 yr). All patients have multiple previous surgeries (>3 surgical procedures) for otosclerosis (3 patients) or chronic otitis media (8 patients), and in all cases, the stapes was not accessible due to obliteration by sclerotic tissue. Preoperative and postoperative air conduction, bone conduction, as well as aided and unaided thresholds and speech scores were measured., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: No significant differences were observed between preoperative and postoperative air-conduction and bone-conduction pure-tone averages. The average free field functional gain obtained with the implant ranged from 22 to 42 dB at each individual frequency, with a mean of 29 +/- 5 dB across all audiometric frequencies. Word recognition scores demonstrated significant differences between unaided and implant-aided conditions. Complications included 2 cases of postoperative infection (including 1 anacusis) that required explantation, and 1 case reduced initial benefit, followed by a nonfunctioning device. In 10 patients, postoperative hearing was unchanged. The 8 other patients are using their implant daily., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: These results show that this option is valid for patients with a fixed footplate and unsuccessful previous surgeries or patients who cannot benefit from a stapedotomy for anatomic reasons. In some cases, access to the round window membrane could represent a limitation. However, these promising initial results establish the need for further works with regard to 3 issues: 1) clinical data studies are needed, including a greater number of patients to confirm these preliminary results; 2) a long-term follow-up must be performed to detect any possible cochlear adverse effects, in particular, on the basilar membrane; 3) the effect of fascia interposition and tip size has to be evaluated in experimental studies.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Middle ear surgery is primarily concerned with resolving the discharging pathology, in the case of chronic otitis media (COM), or with complete eradication, in case of cholesteatoma. Either of these procedures may require repeated surgeries, often resulting in severe mixed hearing impairment. A middle ear implant may be indicated in these cases instead of a hearing aid because the anatomical conditions in such cases often impede an adequate acoustic coupling. The objective of this study was to evaluate MED-EL Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) implantation in patients with severe conductive and mixed hearing loss occurring after middle ear surgery for cholesteatoma or chronic otitis media (COM)., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Over a 2-years period, the VSB system was implanted in 40 patients between 35 and 81 year old (mean: 59.5). Surgery was performed with comparable technique in 3 regional hospitals in Italy: Rovereto (n=16), Meran (n=12) and Tortona (n=12). The 40 candidates for implantation had a history of 1-5 previous surgeries. Of those, 20 patients suffered from COM and 20 from, cholesteatomas. The floating mass transducer (FMT) of the VSB was placed and stabilized on the round window niche in 32 cases; alternative positioning was necessary in 8 cases. Bone conduction (BC) was tested 1 day post-operatively. At 1 month post-surgery and between 6-9 months, open-field warble tones threshold in VSB-off and VSB-on conditions and open-field speech audiometry for words in quiet were conducted., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Results of BC audiometry one day post-operatively showed no significant changes in hearing. Unaided mean pure tone average (PTA4) was 82.38 dB SPL with a mean speech recognition threshold (SRT) of 94.28 dB SPL. Results obtained after a minimum of three months post-operatively were evaluated in terms of aided thresholds and functional gain. At VSB activation, the mean PTA4 was 50.63 dB SPL with a mean SRT of 61.68 dB. After 6-9 months, the group had a mean PTA4 of 47.89 dB SPL and a mean SRT of 53.33 dB SPL., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Implantation of the VSB with its direct driver of the inner ear fluids appears promising for auditory rehabilitation of severe mixed hearing loss associated with sequelae of cholesteatoma surgery. Patients' results improved over time, allowing us to assume a positive effect of consolidation of the coupling related to fibrosis. Results reported here refer to 6-9 months of observation and do not provide evidence of long term stability.

N2  - <ovid:b>GOALS</ovid:b>: To assess the effects of thickness and position of cartilage used to reconstruct the tympanic membrane (TM) using a novel technique, time-averaged laser holography., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Cartilage is commonly used in TM reconstruction to prevent formation of retraction pockets. The thickness, position, and shape of the cartilage graft may adversely affect TM motion and hearing. We sought to systematically investigate these parameters in an experimental setting., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Computer-assisted optoelectronic laser holography was used in 4 human cadaveric temporal bones to study sound-induced TM motion for 500 Hz to 8 kHz. Stapes velocity was measured with a laser Doppler vibrometer. Baseline (control) measurements were made with the TM intact. Measurements were repeated after a 0.5- or 1.0-mm-thick oval piece of conchal cartilage was placed on the medial TM surface in the posterior-superior quadrant. The cartilage was rotated so that it was either in contact with the bony tympanic rim and manubrium or not., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: At frequencies less than 4 kHz, the cartilage graft had only minor effects on the overall TM fringe patterns. The different conditions had no effects on stapes velocity. Greater than 4 kHz, TM motion was reduced over the grafted TM, both with 0.5- and 1.0-mm-thick grafts. No significant differences in stapes velocity were seen with the 2 different thicknesses of cartilage compared with control., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Computer-assisted optoelectronic laser holography is a promising technique to investigate middle ear mechanics after tympanoplasty. Such positioning may prevent postoperative TM retraction. These findings and conclusions apply to cartilage placed in the posterior-superior TM quadrant.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study is to evaluate postoperative spatial speech discrimination in noise in a group of otosclerotic patients with unilateral hearing loss in a 6-month follow-up. Moreover, an additional objective is to verify if our routine criteria (air-bone gap >30 dB at 250-2,000 Hz) for surgical indication in such patients can be acceptable., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective evaluation in 20 patients divided into 2 groups: unilateral otosclerosis and bilateral otosclerosis already successfully operated on 1 side and planned for stapedotomy on the contralateral ear., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center, University clinic., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Otosclerotic patients with unilateral hearing loss., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Evaluation of functional outcome., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: Spatial test based on speech discrimination in noise., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All patients reach postoperative air-bone gap closure within 10 dB. Average postoperative gain in discrimination under noise was 11.5% for unilateral otosclerosis group and 19.3% for the second ear group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Free-field discrimination in noise closely reflects the usual listening conditions in everyday life. Improvement in postoperative free-field discrimination in noise can justify our routine criteria for surgical indication in the patients with unilateral otosclerosis and with bilateral otosclerosis already operated on 1 side. The surgical choice for each patient, apart from audiologic evaluation, is linked to a truly informed consent regarding possible advantages and risks mainly based on an analysis of the real auditory needs of the patient and individual results of the surgeon.

N2  - Superior semicircular canal dehiscence (SSCD) can present with a variety of symptoms that can be predominantly auditory, predominantly vestibular or both. It can mimic a wide range of otological disorders, in particular otosclerosis-like stapes fixation. Our study revealed that, in 5.3% of our patients with clinically suspected otosclerosis, SSCD was detected in high-resolution multi-detector computed tomography (HRMDCT) of the temporal bone. We therefore emphasise the value of HRMDCT with reconstructions in the plane of the superior semicircular canal and perpendicular to the superior semicircular canal in the diagnostic work-up of each patient with a tentative diagnosis of otosclerosis-type stapes fixation. Where there are doubts, VEMP testing should be performed. We believe that a number of unexplained complications after an uneventful stapedotomy procedure might be explained by a pre-operatively undetected dehiscent superior semicircular canal and therefore unwarranted surgery. The typical feature of the conductive hearing loss due to SSCD compared to otosclerosis is an air-bone gap which is much more prominent at low frequencies than at high frequencies.

T1  - Masked patulous Eustachian tube: an important diagnostic precaution before middle ear surgery.

N2  - The Eustachian tube is normally closed, but it opens upon swallowing for only less than one second to equalize the middle ear pressure with the atmospheric pressure, and immediately closes again. Patients with patulous Eustachian tube (PET) suffer from annoying symptoms, such as aural fullness (sensation of fullness in the ear), autophonia (abnormally loud audition of own voice), audition of breathing sound, and fluctuating sensation of the tympanic membrane upon respiration. The diagnosis of PET is not difficult when patients complain of such typical symptoms. However, there is an unexpected pitfall, in which the symptoms of PET are masked by the presence of conductive hearing loss and obvious middle ear pathology. Here, we propose that this condition be termed 'masked patulous Eustachian tube' to promote correct diagnosis prior to planning the middle ear surgery. Four representative patients with 'masked patulous Eustachian tube' are presented: two exhibited symptoms after repair of chronic perforation of the tympanic membrane, one after stapes surgery for otosclerosis, and one after cholesteatoma surgery. In these patients, the symptoms of PET became evident only after surgery due to the improvement of hearing. The degree of hearing improvement varied among the patients from 15 to 40 dB in average hearing level. It is therefore important to examine the presence of 'masked patulous Eustachian tube', in addition to a middle ear disease for which surgery is planned. The surgeon should inform the patient of the possibility of 'masked patulous Eustachian tube' to avoid the postoperative disappointment.

Speech discrimination scores also were noted., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All groups showed significant improvement. The greatest increase in postoperative speech discrimination score was seen in group 3. Group 1 improved from moderate hearing loss (mean, 49 dB) to normal (mean, 24 dB); group 2, from moderately severe loss (mean, 61.2 dB) to mild (mean, 28 dB); and group 3, from severe loss (mean, 76.4 dB) to moderate (mean, 41.1 dB)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Success in treating otosclerosis does not depend on extent of preoperative hearing loss. Patients with severe loss improved to moderate, increasing the benefit from use of a hearing aid. The patients attained good auditory function, improving their quality of life.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To determine whether any factors are predictive of success or failure in primary ossiculoplasty employing autologous bone in Austin-Kartush Group A (stapes and malleus handle present) ears., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective review of a single-surgeon case series., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Two District General Hospitals in the United Kingdom., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Of 135 patients undergoing primary repair, 116 had sufficient data for analysis (mean follow-up 33 months)., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOMES MEASURED</ovid:b>: Postoperative air-bone gaps (pABG) in patients with differing qualities of middle-ear mucosa (active versus inactive), differing pathologies (mucosal versus squamous) and differing surgical procedures [canal-wall up (CWU) versus canal-wall down (CWD)]., <ovid:b>SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: 'Belfast Rule of Thumb' (operated ear hearing brought to 30 dB or better or to within 15 dB of contralateral ear)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Postoperative ABGs were closed within 10 dB in 37%, 20 dB in 74% at latest follow-up. The only significant factors predicting hearing outcomes were the status of the canal wall (CWU = 14.1 dB, CWD = 24.7 dB: significant, P = 0.00) and whether surgery was primary or revision. Mean ABG was 14.7 for inactive middle ear mucosa, 17.2 for active middle ear mucosa (not significant, P = 0.25). Excluding CWD procedures from the analysis improved outcomes to 80% (within 20 dB) and 41% (within 10 dB) overall, and the mean for active and inactive ears to 14.2 and 14.0 dB respectively. Postoperatively, 82% of patients fulfilled the 'Belfast Rule of Thumb'., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The most significant prognostic factor affecting hearing outcomes - status of the canal wall - is independent of staging. The factor most associated with staging - the status of the middle ear mucosa - is only weakly associated with a successful functional outcome.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare the administration of sub hypnotic dose of propofol with metoclopramide and placebo in prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) after middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: This clinical research was performed in the Faculty of Medicine, Gazi University, Besevler, Ankara, Turkey, between December 2004 and October 2005. Following approval by the hospital ethics committee, 60 adult patients scheduled for a middle ear operation were randomly assigned into 3 groups. The patients in group P received 0.5 mg x kg(-1) propofol; in group M, 0.2 mg x kg(-1) metoclopramide, and in group C, 0.9% saline solution. The number of patients suffering from nausea and vomiting at 0-4, 4-12, and 12-24 hours postoperatively, and additional use of antiemetics was recorded., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Comparisons of the data showed that at 0-4th hours, the incidence of vomiting was 25% in group P, 40% in group M, and 75% in group C. The incidence rate of group P was significantly lower than that of group C (p=0.002), and the rate of antiemetics use in group C was higher than that in group P (p=0.028). The Nausea Vomiting Scale scores of group C were also significantly higher than those of group P (p=0.005). There were no significant differences between the values at 4-12 and 12-24 hours., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The administration of a sub hypnotic dose of propofol at the end of surgery was found to be at least as effective as metoclopramide in preventing PONV in the early postoperative period in adult patients undergoing middle ear surgery.

PORs were performed in cases of a incudostapedial joint problem, ossicular anomaly, or ossicular fixation. The preoperative and 6-month postoperative mean air-conduction thresholds and air-bone gaps were not significantly different in the comparisons between the 2 groups. The mean values for the postoperative air-bone gap closure were not significantly different in the 2 groups. The hearing results 3 years after surgery were available in 13 patients in each group. In these patients, the mean values of the preoperative and the 3-year postoperative air-conduction threshold and air-bone gap were not statistically different in the 2 groups. However, the mean air-bone gap closure in the POR group was 28.6 +/- 10.2 dB hearing level compared with 19.0 +/- 12.9 dB hearing loss in the T2 group, which was statistically significant (p = 0.034)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: POR can be a good surgical option in cases of a poor incudostapedial joint connection, ossicular anomaly, or ossicular fixation.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The first hearing results with a new stapes prosthesis with clip function (Soft-CliP(R) piston) are presented., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: This new prosthesis was used in 15 patients (mean age 45.2 years; range 21-63 years) undergoing routine stapes surgery. Soft-CliP(R) piston prostheses with a shaft diameter of 0.4 mm and a length ranging from 4.25 mm to 5.5 mm were used. Postoperative audiological testing and measurement of the air-bone gap were performed after an average of 47.3 days and compared with the preoperative values., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The median observed postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 8.33 dB +/-4.16 dB. All patients had less than 20 dB ABG and in 53.3% of cases was less than 10 dB. The operating time showed a clear difference between the left (66.5 min +/-37.79 min) and right ears (47.2 min +/-11.08 min)., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION</ovid:b>: This new prosthesis design greatly facilitates a very difficult step in stapes surgery, the prosthesis fixation to the incus. The first postoperative hearing results are very promising but long-term results in a larger group of patients are still pending.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: This work examines the application possibilities of the panoramic visualization system (HD-PVS) in ENT surgery. The HD-PVS is a new optical system that is neither an endoscope nor a microscope. It has a focal length of 200 mm and a wide field of view., <ovid:b>PATIENT AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The analysis of the visualization quality took place under laboratory conditions at 4 close-to-surgery scenarios with a total of 40 result values. Furthermore, the system was used for 45 operative procedures on patients (tympanoplasty, parotidectomy, neck dissection, septumplasty, transfacial approaches). The results were analyzed following the ICCAS workflow-scheme and with standardized questionnaires., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The analysis of the visualization quality of the PVS exhibited the best total evaluation in 2 out of 4 scenarios, in 1 scenario HD-PVS attained the maximum score possible, as did the microscope and the endoscope was better than HD-PVS in 1 scenario. The microscope was never evaluated as being better than HD-PVS. Apart from its use in middle ear surgery, the HD-PVS can be considered operational in 4 out of 5 clinical applications with only slight modifications., <ovid:b>CONSEQUENCES</ovid:b>: The advantages of HD-PVS over gold standards such as the surgical microscope are lower initial costs for the optical system with frequently already existing HD-video system, smaller space requirements, equal or sometimes better visualization quality, possibility of videoendoscopic representation of surgery and better ergonomic conditions.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Canal wall down (CWD) tympanoplasty with soft-wall reconstruction (SWR) is a unique technique for cholesteatoma surgery. The external auditory canal shape after surgery-retracted like a radical mastoid cavity or preserved intact-depends on postoperative aeration in the mastoid cavity. However, the relationship between postoperative middle ear aeration and hearing outcome with this procedure is unknown. We characterized this relationship and propose an ideal state of middle ear aeration to obtain satisfactory postoperative hearing after CWD tympanoplasty with SWR., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective case series., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Seventy-eight patients (78 ears) with fresh cholesteatomas treated surgically at our hospital by planned 2-stage CWD tympanoplasty and SWR were included., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Postoperative middle ear aeration was scored 1 year after second-stage surgery by computed tomography. The patients were divided into 4 bins according to postoperative audiometric air-bone (A-B) gaps: 0-10, 11-20, 21-30, and greater than 30 dB., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Postoperative middle ear aeration was significantly greater in the smaller gap bins (0-10 and 11-20 dB) compared with the larger A-B gap bins (21-30 and >30 dB). In contrast to the larger A-B gap bins, those with smaller A-B gaps showed reaeration of the antrum and mastoid cavity. No significant differences were observed in postoperative middle ear aeration or hearing outcome between the 2 cholesteatoma types., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Promoting postoperative aeration of the entire middle ear is necessary to achieve better hearing outcome in patients undergoing CWD tympanoplasty and SWR for cholesteatoma.

N2  - Besides eradication of chronic middle ear disease, the reconstruction of the sound conduction apparatus is a major goal of modern ear microsurgery. The material of choice in cases of partial ossicular replacement prosthesis is the autogenous ossicle. In the event of more extensive destruction of the ossicular chain diverse alloplastic materials, e. g. metals, ceramics, plastics or composits are used for total reconstruction. Their specialised role in conducting sound energy within a half-open implant bed sets high demands on the biocompatibility as well as the acoustic-mechanic properties of the prosthesis. Recently, sophisticated titanium middle ear implants allowing individual adaptation to anatomical variations are widely used for this procedure. However, despite modern developments, hearing restoration with passive implants often faces its limitations due to tubal-middle-ear dysfunction. Here, implantable hearing aids, successfully used in cases of sensorineural hearing loss, offer a promising alternative. This article reviews the actual state of affairs of passive and active middle ear implants.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: The purpose of this study was to assess the results after primary otosclerosis surgery at Odense University Hospital., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The study was based on information collected from a database and from patient records. A total of 154 primary stapedotomies (138 patients) were performed using small-fenester-technique in the period 1996-2005. Five experienced ear surgeons performed the operations. The surgeons were still in the learning phase with regard to otosclerosis surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A significant improvement was found regarding the air-conduction pure tone average (PTA) (52.8 dB to 31.4 dB), the bone conduction PTA (25.2 dB to 23,1 dB), air-bone gap (27.6 dB to 8.3 dB), and the speech reception threshold (44.8 dB to 22.5 dB). One operation (0.6%) resulted in severe sensory-neural hearing loss, while other types of complications were seen after 7,2% of the operations. After thirteen operations (8.4%), reoperation was subsequently needed., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Patients undergoing primary otosclerosis surgery gained a significant hearing improvement. The results of this survey matched those of larger international and Danish studies. Experienced ear surgeons can perform stapedotomy with good results without having initial experience in otosclerosis surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To validate a disease-specific health related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument for children with chronic suppurative otitis media with or without cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Caregivers of 45 children with chronic suppurative otitis media, who were offered an operation (tympanoplasty or radical mastoidectomy) in a tertiary children's hospital, were administered a 5-item quality of life survey (COM-5) The COM-5, which is a modified version of OM-6, was administered four times: few weeks and few days before operation and six months and one year postoperatively. Psychometric characteristics and more specifically test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct validity, and responsiveness to clinical change of the COM-5 score were the main outcome measures., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Median COM-5 score was 2.6 (1- to 7-point scale) with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life. Test-retest reliability was good (interclass correlation coefficient=0.73) Construct validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between COM-5 score and global ear-related quality of life (R=-0.485), between physical suffering and ear-related physician visits (R=0.41) and between caregiver concerns vs ear-related physician visits (R=0.44). The mean change in COM-5 score after successful tympanoplasty was 1.1 and correlated well with the change of global ear-related quality of life rating (R=-0.545) as well as with the degree of clinical change reported by the caregiver (R=0.494). The mean standardized response was 1.3 after tympanoplasty indicating the instrument's large responsiveness to clinical change after this procedure, but only 0.7 after radical mastoidectomy., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The COM-5 is a valid, reliable and responsive instrument. Apart from its satisfactory psychometric characteristics, it can be easily administered in caregivers of children who require a tympanoplasty due to chronic suppurative otitis media.

N2  - This work examines the application possibilities of a new visualization system, the Panoramic Visualization System (HD-PVS), in ENT surgery. The Panoramic Visualization System (PVS) is a novel optical system that is neither an endoscope nor a microscope. It has a focal length of 200 mm, a wide field of view and is used together with an HD camera and an HD monitor (HD-PVS). The analysis of the visualization quality took place in laboratory conditions using 4 close-to-surgery scenarios with altogether 40 data points. Further, the system was used on patients in 45 procedures (tympanoplasty, parotidectomy, neck dissection, septumplasty, transfacial approaches). The results were analyzed following the ICCAS workflow-scheme and with standardized questionnaires. In the analysis of the visualization quality, the PVS exhibited the best total evaluation in the lab test in two out of four scenarios. In one of four scenarios, the PVS as well as the microscope achieved the maximum attainable score. In one out of four scenarios, the endoscope attained a better result than the PVS. The microscope was never superior to the HD-PVS in terms of image quality. In four out of five clinical applications, the PVS was evaluated as operational with slight modifications. Most development is needed in middle ear surgery applications. The remaining procedures already benefit in the system configuration examined here, and they were regularly accomplished with support of the PVS. The present study offers a good basis for introducing the PVS to ENT surgery. The advantages over the existing gold standard include lower initial costs for the optical system than for an operating microscope since the HD-video system is often already in place, smaller space requirements than a microscope, equal or at times better visualization quality than the microscope, the possibility of videoendoscopic representation of surgeries in which this was impossible before, and better ergonomic conditions.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The functional outcome of ossiculoplasties in chronic ear and lateral cranium base surgery depends on the presence of a ventilated middle ear space and is guided by the existence or absence of ossicular remnants. In patients with poorly ventilated middle ears, after multiple previous operations, missing stapes suprastructure, or after partial temporal bone resection for tumor removal, restoration of conductive hearing is not possible. The direct placement of a vibrating floating mass transducer (FMT) onto the round window membrane with obliteration of the surgical cavity is a new option., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Starting in January 2006, five patients underwent a subtotal petrosectomy to control their chronically discharging ear, to remove residual cholesteatoma, or to revise previous incompletely exenterated cavities. Four patients underwent a simultaneous placement of a Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) onto the round window membrane; one patient had a staged reconstruction after initial Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid rehabilitation. In all operations, the external ear canal and the eustachian tube were closed, and the cavity was obliterated using abdominal fat., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Preoperative and postoperative pure tone audiograms were analyzed in respect to deterioration of inner ear function, aided and unaided (hearing aid, VSB, and Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid) speech audiograms were compared to verify improvements in communication skills, functional gains were calculated at comfortable level settings, and postoperative computed tomographic scans were used to exclude recurrent disease and to confirm the position of the FMT onto the round window membrane. Patient's satisfaction was measured using a standardized questionnaire., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All patients were very satisfied daily users of their middle ear implant and had complete eradication of their middle ear pathology. Bone conduction worsened at 2 kHz, with preservation of inner ear function in the other frequencies. Whereas none of the patients had any unaided speech discrimination before the surgery at conversational levels, all patients obtained 95 to 100% correct monosyllabic scores at 70 to 80 dB using the VSB. The functional gain was highest at higher frequencies., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Patients with combined hearing loss undergoing subtotal petrosectomy with complete fat obliteration of the middle ear and mastoid area can be safely rehabilitated, placing the FMT of a VSB onto the round window membrane, either at the time of primary surgery, or as a staged secondary procedure.

N2  - <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Retroauricular tympanoplasty and tympanomastoidectomy under local anesthesia with sedation can be well tolerated by the patient, with minimum discomfort., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate patient discomfort from pain, body/neck position, noise, and anxiety during tympanoplasties and mastoidectomies performed under local anesthesia with sedation., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: This was a prospective study of 83 surgeries in 62 patients (28 type I tympanoplasties, 12 tympanoplasties with ossicular reconstruction, 40 canal wall up mastoidectomies, and 3 revision tympanoplasties). Local infiltration used lidocaine 2% with 1:100 000 epinephrine infiltrated in the retroauricular area and from below the pinna in a 'V' pattern. Sedation was achieved with 50 mg of intramuscular promethazine 1 h before surgery and intravenous midazolam (0.03 mg/kg) at the beginning of surgery. Subsequent doses of midazolam were given to maintain adequate sedation, up to 10 mg. The discomfort during surgery was assessed by the patient with a score from 0 to 4 (0 = no discomfort and 4 = extreme discomfort)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Discomfort due to pain had a mean score of 0.83. Noise discomfort (from drilling and manipulation of instruments) had the lowest mean score (0.70), and discomfort from body and neck position had the highest mean score (1.51).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The purpose of this study was to determine the economic viability of stapes surgery in Germany. We compared the cost of the operation to the retail value and average cost of a lifelong supply of hearing aids., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral centre., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: One hundred and sixty-four consecutive cases of primary stapedotomy performed on patients with otosclerosis at our institution served as the representative group for the calculation. The post-operative air-bone gap average at the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz was less than 10 dB for 62 per cent of the patients, and less than 20 dB for 92 per cent of the patients. There was a post-operative sensorineural hearing loss in 1.2 per cent of the patients., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Analysis showed that, even for an elderly patient aged 65 years with a life expectancy of 15 years, the cost of a lifelong supply of hearing aids was greater than that of a stapedotomy procedure. Based on our group of patients, the stapedotomy procedure proved to be euro 800,000 K cheaper than treatment with an averagely priced hearing aid. The economic benefit was still present when taking into account possible revision surgery in 5-10 per cent of cases, and also when, in addition to the surgery, a post-operative hearing aid was required, in for example 20 per cent of cases., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Stapes surgery is economically beneficial for the individual patient as well as for the general patient cohort, irrespective of age. The stapedotomy procedure also prevents the known disadvantages of conventional hearing aids, thus improving the patient's quality of life.

T1  - Preliminary results in cochlear implant surgery without antromastoidectomy and with atraumatic electrode insertion: the endomeatal approach.

N2  - A surgical approach using the external auditory canal and the round window as a natural access pathway for cochlear implant positioning, the endomeatal approach, is described. This approach avoids performing an antromastoidectomy, the subsequent posterior tympanotomy and the promontorial cochleostomy. The endomeatal approach also allows an optimal insertion plane for electrode array atraumatic insertion through the round window. The technique was developed and practiced in 35 fresh temporal bones and then it was applied in ten patients. This surgery has an endomeatal first stage, which begins with a stapedectomy-like tympanomeatal flap. This flap allows an easy access to scala tympani via round window niche. The internal part of a groove is drilled on the posterior wall of the EAC. The groove is parallel to the EAC axis and starts in its inner border. Once the endomeatal stage is completed, a standard retroauricular approach is performed, in order to make the receptor-stimulator well and to complete the groove externally, until it connects the middle ear with the external mastoid surface. A flat second well is drilled in front of the first one to lodge the remaining electrode lead. In small children this well is deepened. The electrode array is introduced in the scala tympani through the RW and located into the groove. The electrode is covered and fixed inside the groove with bone pate. The extra length of the electrode lead is located in the second well and the receptor-stimulator is fixed in its well. The ground electrode is placed under the periosteum, the retroauricular incision is sutured, the tympanomeatal flap is restored and a dressing is placed into the EAC. Surgical time was significantly shorter than in standard approach. There were neither surgical nor healing complications. Electrode insertion was easy and complete and functional results were adequate. The goal of this approach is to avoid antromastoidectomy and posterior tympanotomy, which are replaced by the EAC groove. It is faster and safer, eliminating the risk of facial nerve injury. It also allows a better access to the round window, with a less traumatic electrode insertion, suitable for "soft surgery" performing. It may advantageously replace the classical transmastoideal approach.

N2  - The authors describe a case of bilateral promontory fistula due to noncholesteatomatous chronic otitis media in a 46-year-old male. We performed both open cavity mastoidectomy and left staged ossiculoplasty. One year postoperatively, the audiogram showed an improved left air conduction threshold and maintenance of bone conduction. We suggest that noncholesteatomatous chronic otitis media can induce various destructive changes via the chronic inflammatory reaction.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE</ovid:b>: The objective of this study is to understand the outcome of minimally invasive topical anesthetized transcanal inlay and underlay tympanoplasty, and to compare these 2 procedures in hearing result, take rate, perioperative pain, and operation time., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: This is a retrospective study conducted from September 2003 to December 2006. Forty-eight tympanoplasty in 46 patients, 28 inlay and 20 underlay procedures, with small- to medium-sized tympanic membrane perforations without middle ear lesion, were studied in a tertiary referral center. Interventions included otologic examination, perioperative hearing evaluation, local anesthetized transcanal inlay, or underlay tympanoplasty. The outcome measurements were the following: the take rate and audiometric result at the last follow-up visit, perioperative pain, and duration of surgery. The statistical methods used were t test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi(2) test, and Fisher exact test., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The take rate were 82.1% in the inlay group and 85% in the underlay group, without significant difference (P = .79) at the last follow-up visit. Air-bone gap closure was 6.3 +/- 2.5 dB in the inlay group and 9.3 +/- 3.2 dB in the underlay (P = .07). Linear analogue scale of perioperative pain was lower in the inlay group with significance (1.7 +/- 1.2 in the inlay and 4.6 +/- 1.9 in the underlay group, P < .001). The duration of the surgery was significantly shorter in the inlay group (31.8 +/- 13.9 minutes for the inlay group and 75.9 +/- 14.6 minutes for the underlay group, P < .001)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Minimally invasive topically anesthetized transcanal tympanoplasty provides satisfactory surgical and audiometric outcome both in inlay and underlay procedures. The take rate and extent of hearing recovery are similar in both groups. However, inlay tympanoplasty is superior to transcanal tympanoplasty because of less discomfort and shorter operation time.

Dexmedetomidine (D) was administered to Group SD and Group TD first as a bolus dose of one microg kg(-1), then intraoperative maintenance was supplied with dexmedetomidine 0.7 microg kg(-1) hour(-1). Groups S and T (controls) were given identical amounts of saline. If systolic blood pressure measurements are greater than 20% preoperative values, then fentanyl one microg kg(-1) was given., <ovid:b>MEASUREMENTS</ovid:b>: Intraoperative blood loss was determined with suction volumes and gauze counting. Bleeding was rated according to a 6-point scale. Hemodynamic parameters and fentanyl administration were recorded., <ovid:b>MAIN RESULTS</ovid:b>: Group SD had less bleeding and lower bleeding scores (P < 0.05). In addition, this group received less intraoperative fentanyl (P < 0.05). The only significant difference between Groups TD and T was the amount of intraoperative fentanyl given (35.4 +/- 58.8 vs 110.0 +/- 81.0 microg) (P < 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Dexmedetomidine reduces bleeding, bleeding scores, and intraoperative fentanyl consumption during general anesthesia in septoplasty operations.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: This study describes a transcanal antrotomy technique and highlights its advantages for removal of disease in the tympanum and antrum., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective review of surgical cases using a transcanal antrotomy approach., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The author's database of major otological procedures was reviewed to identify cases in which a transcanal approach was utilized to remove disease confined to the tympanum-antrum. Cases in which disease progressed into the mastoid, requiring a postauricular approach were excluded. Patient demographics, ear pathology, surgical variables, postoperative variables, and audiometric data were recorded. Standard descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and clinical characteristics of study cases. Intraoperative video segments were recorded and edited to depict the operative technique., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Transcanal antrotomy was performed on 47 patients (mean age = 38.7, 51% men, 49% women). Ossicular reconstruction was performed in 27 patients during initial surgery. Sculptured, interposed incus was used in 77.8% of cases. Average intraoperative time was 130 minutes (range = 79-166 min). No major complications occurred postoperatively. Follow-up ranged from 26 to 3,680 days (average = 922 days). No patient had recurrent disease in the antrum. Closure of air-bone gap to within 20 dB occurred in 85% of cases., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Transcanal antrotomy is a safe, efficacious, and minimally-invasive approach to remove disease from the middle ear and antrum. This approach allows for optimal exposure of the antrum and is less invasive than postauricular and endaural approaches. With transcanal antrotomy, second stage procedures can be avoided in many cases resulting in reduced costs and improved quality of life.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Surgery can often eradicate chronic middle ear disease in patients with recurrent cholesteatoma, tubal dysfunction, and others; however, in many cases, social hearing cannot be restored even after multiple revision tympanoplasties. A hearing aid is then recommended. Placement of an implantable hearing aid with its advantage of an unoccluded ear canal, irrespective of middle ear function, seems to be a promising alternative., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: After establishing the biomechanics of the ear in our temporal bone laboratory, various locations and attachments of a Vibrant transducer were investigated. These experiments resulted in the development of a new titanium clip holder for a Vibrant integrated total ossicular replacement prosthesis assembly with placement on the footplate. Four patients with permanent severe combined hearing loss were implanted with this device after multiple revision tympanoplasties. The first case is described in detail., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Placing a transducer directly on the footplate via a rod transmission gave a better gain for the high frequencies than in the round window location. The acoustic results of the patients showed an improved gain in speech understanding, unobtainable by a conventional hearing aid., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The concept of a total ossicular replacement prosthesis-vibroplasty establishes a straightforward procedure in the tympanic cavity similar to a normal tympanoplasty. The open ear canal and its superior acoustic performance offer a promising perspective for revision operations in cases of incurable middle ear dysfunction.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: Tight fixation of stapes prostheses yields better functional results because sound transmission from the incus to the prosthesis is improved., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The optimal prosthesis to use for otosclerosis surgery is still a matter of debate. It has been proposed that using prostheses made of Nitinol, a shape-memory metal, produces better functional results with less variability and reduced risk for middle and inner ear damage. This is thought to be because heat activation rather than manual crimping of the prosthesis loop forms a tighter fixation., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Functional results of two groups were compared 1 year after surgery. In one group were 75 cases of stapedotomy performed using Nitinol prostheses. Results were analyzed prospectively and compared with 75 retrospectively analyzed matched controls with conventional stapes prostheses. Crimping quality was measured in 23 patients by intraoperative laser Doppler interferometry (LDI). Causality was assessed by correlating results of intraoperative LDI and postoperative pure-tone thresholds., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Nitinol and conventional prostheses yielded postoperative air-bone gaps (ABGs) of 8.0 and 11.6 dB with 71 and 43% ABG closure within 10 dB, respectively. Intraoperatively, sound transmission was improved by 2.5 dB with the Nitinol prostheses as compared with conventional prostheses. These differences were statistically significant. Intraoperative fixation quality was positively correlated to functional outcome, but results were not statistically significant., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Tight fixation, as provided by Nitinol prostheses leads to improved functional results because of better sound transmission properties at the incus-prosthesis interface. The improvement in ABG closure is in the range of 3 dB pure-tone average and more pronounced at higher frequencies. Nitinol prostheses provide an effective treatment option in otosclerosis surgery.

N2  - Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a congenital malformation of craniofacial development; in these patients conventional direct laryngoscopy is very difficult and often unsuccessful because of the upper airway malformation. A 20-year-old man with TCS was scheduled for elective tympanoplasty. The patient showed the characteristic facial appearance of TCS, and a difficult airway was anticipated. After careful anesthesia induction, direct laryngoscopy with Macintosh blade no. 4 of a direct laryngoscope failed to visualize the epiglottis, even with cricoid pressure, resulting in a grade 4 Cormack and Lehane view. Next, the AirWay Scope was easily inserted, and his glottic opening was clearly visualized. An 8.0-mm-internal-diameter tracheal tube was then advanced into the trachea without any difficulty. The AirWay Scope is a very useful airway device for orotracheal intubation; it provides an excellent view of the glottis without requiring alignment of the oral, pharyngeal, and laryngeal axes, and appears to be promising for use in patients with a difficult airway.

N2  - In line with the rising number of recreational divers, the otorhinolaryngologist has to deal with growing numbers of diving-associated disorders of the ear, nose and throat (ENT). Nevertheless, the majority of divers present to their ENT doctor for assessment of their fitness to dive. On the basis of long-term follow-up examinations and increasing experience in diving medicine, even divers with a history of ENT problems can be considered fit to dive. Therefore, diving is possible after tympanoplasty, surgery to improve hearing including stapesplasty, after implantation of middle ear amplifiers or cochlear implants, after sinus or scull base surgery and even after canal wall down mastoidectomy, provided that certain requirements are fulfilled. Assessing fitness to dive after inner ear barotrauma as well as after inner ear decompression illness requires meticulous consideration of residual damage and possible underlying conditions like vascular right-to-left shunts. This article is based on the new recommendations of the German Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society for the assessment of fitness to dive in the otorhinolaryngological field.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To demonstrate that 1) recent graduates of training programs in otorhinolaryngology-head and neck surgery are less likely to recommend/perform stapedectomy than more senior otolaryngologists; and 2) when surgery is recommended, referral is most commonly made to an otologist/neurotologist., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Survey of 500 regional otolaryngologists pertaining to their treatment of patients with hearing loss secondary to otosclerosis., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Otolaryngologists in community practice were provided with written surveys pertaining to their treatment of otosclerosis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Data were obtained from 179 general otolaryngologists treating adults and children in solo or group private practices in our geographic region. The majority (66%) diagnosed one to five new cases per year. Ten percent of surgeons graduating in the 1970s, 25% graduating in the 1980s, 50% graduating in the 1990s, and 90% of graduates in the 2000s never performed stapedectomy as part of their practices (P < .001). Similarly, a significant number of surgeons who formerly performed stapedectomies no longer do this surgery. A trend toward greater use of hearing aids for the treatment of otosclerosis was seen in more recent graduates (P < .08). When surgery was recommended, otologists/neurotologists received the majority of referrals (75%) from the practitioners surveyed., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Stapedectomy is performed and recommended less often by more recent graduates of otolaryngology training programs. Training requirements for both general otolaryngologists and neurotologists may need modification given current practice patterns for stapes surgery.

N2  - We evaluated auditory performance following cartilage tympanoplasty for the management of tympanic membrane retraction pockets. We performed a 230-patient retrospective study over a 10-year period (1990-2000) and compared pre-operative and postoperative audiograms. Postoperative audiograms were better in 49% of cases, identical in 16% and worse in 11%. Cartilage tympanoplasty for the management of tympanic membrane retraction pockets has a good postoperative functional outcome. Cartilage graft is useful for reconstruction of the eardrum and tympanic bone defects.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare the effect of remifentanil combined with desflurane or isoflurane on the quality of the operative field and surgical conditions, blood loss, and recovery during tympanoplasty or endoscopic sinus surgery., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Randomised, double-blinded clinical study., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS</ovid:b>: Sixty-four patients were scheduled for elective tympanoplasty or endoscopic sinus surgery. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: desflurane or isoflurane. After anaesthesia induction, all patients received a continuous remifentanil infusion of 0.2-0.5 microg/kg/min until a mean arterial pressure of 65-75 mmHg was achieved. Heart rate and mean arterial pressure were recorded throughout anaesthesia. Blood loss was measured at the end of surgery. Achievement of a bloodless operative field was rated on a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Following completion of surgery, the time to extubation and to achievement of an Aldrete score of nine or more was recorded., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Sixty-three patients were evaluated. The total dose of remifentanil and the total blood loss were similar in both groups (p > 0.05). Time to extubation and to an Aldrete score of nine or more for the desflurane group was significantly less than for the isoflurane group (p 0.05)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Although desflurane and isoflurane both enabled good surgical conditions (in terms of quality of operative field) and convenient induction of hypotension for tympanoplasty and endoscopic sinus surgery, the recovery characteristics of desflurane were better than those of isoflurane. Therefore, desflurane may be preferable to isoflurane in such circumstances.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess the role of the CT-scan in the preoperative evaluation of juvenile otosclerosis and to study additional outcome data., <ovid:b>DESIGN AND SETTING</ovid:b>: We performed a retrospective case series study from an academic referral hospital using data from 1992 to 2005., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: We selected patients younger than 18-year-old who had undergone primary stapedectomy for otosclerosis among the 10 stapedectomies performed over the study period and analyzed the patients' systematic pre- and post-operative audiograms and CT-scan findings., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: For this survey, complete data was available for 7 children, totaling 10 primary stapedectomies for otosclerosis. Their ages at diagnosis ranged from 10 to 17 years. In 4 children, CT-scan demonstrated bilateral findings typical of otosclerosis: poorly calcified foci near the fissula ante fenestram, associated with a hypodense edging surrounding the labyrinthine capsule in 2 children. The youngest patient had no CT-scan abnormalities. Stapedectomy was performed in one case and laser stapedotomy in 9 cases. Seven children were immediately improved following surgery and no postoperative facial palsy or prolonged vertigo was reported. The mean (S.D.) postoperative ABG was 6.5dB (+/-3.7). The mean closure was 19dB (+/-11.2). The mean change in high-tone bone conduction level was 1.8dB (+/-7.5). Six children had a postoperative ABG less than 10dB while in one, the ABG was inferior to 20dB., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Preoperative CT-scan is useful for the preoperative diagnosis of otosclerosis in children. The images seen must be distinguished from other footplate pathologies or deformities of the ossicular chain which are often associated with poorer surgical results. This survey provides additional evidence that stapes surgery is an effective procedure for treating juvenile otosclerosis.

N2  - To compare the safety and efficacy of the transobturator tape (Monarc) with the retropubic tape (tension-free vaginal tape, TVTR) for the treatment of urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) a prospective, single-blinded, multi-centre randomised clinical controlled trial was undertaken in four urogynaecology units in Australia. One hundred and eighty-seven women with USI were randomly allocated to undergo surgery with either the Monarc sling (n = 80) or TVT (n = 107). Outcome measures were intra-operative complications (especially bladder injury), as well as peri-operative complications, symptomatology, quality of life and urodynamic outcomes. At 3 months, data were available on 140 women, 82 (59%) TVT and 58 (42%) Monarc. The TVT group was significantly more likely to be complicated by bladder injury (7 TVT, 0 Monarc, p < 0.05). Blood loss and operative time were significantly less in the Monarc group, which was 49 mls (31) vs that of the TVT group, which was 64 mls (41) p < 0.05; 18.5 min (6.5) TVT vs 14.6 min (6) Monarc (p < 0.001). The subjective and objective stress incontinence cure rates were 86.6% (71) vs 72.4% (42) p = 0.77 and 79.3 vs 84.5%, p = 0.51 for the TVT and Monarc groups, respectively. Both groups reported similar improvement in incontinence impact and satisfaction with their operation, although return to activity was significantly quicker with the transobturator route (p = 0.029). The transobturator tape appears to be as effective as the retro-pubic tape in the short term, with a reduction in the risk of intra-operative bladder injury, shorter operating time, decreased blood loss, and quicker return to usual activities.

N2  - Taste change is a well documented but under emphasised complication of middle ear surgery and is usually related to damage to the chorda tympani nerve (CTN). However, the taste outcomes following cochlear implantation have not been previously recorded. One hundred and forty one patients who had received cochlear implants between January 1997 and April 2006 were questioned using a postal survey regarding changes in the sense of taste following cochlear implantation. Sixty seven per cent of questionnaires were returned. Forty three patients (45%) experienced changes in taste following their surgery. Eighteen patients (19%) said that their symptoms had not resolved by the end of the follow up period (mean 51 months). CTN division produced taste change in 86%. Fifty per cent of patients who had CTN preservation developed taste change, presumably related to occult trauma to the nerve. The difference in the number of patients describing taste change in the two groups was statistically significant (p < 0.05). Resolution of symptoms took a mean of 20 weeks. For those patients in whom taste change was noted, resolution of symptoms was more likely if the CTN was divided rather than preserved although the difference was not statistically significant (p < 0.5). This may reflect neuronal injury during surgery which then fails to heal normally. These results are comparable to taste outcomes in patients undertaking middle ear surgery for non-inflammatory disease such as stapedectomy. The symptoms can be extremely troublesome and may not resolve with time. Careful consideration of the CTN intra-operatively is recommended and in the event of injury, the taste outcome may be better if the nerve is divided rather than left in situ but damaged. These findings have significant implications for patients as bilateral implantation becomes more commonplace.<ovid:br/><ovid:br/> Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

T1  - MRI scanners and the stapes prosthesis.
A1  - Fritsch, Michael H
Y1  - 2007//
N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Physicians and patients alike have concerns regarding exposing in vivo implanted metal stapes prostheses to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. As MRI scanners become more powerful, the possibility for stapes prosthesis displacement due to ferromagnetic forces increases. It is hypothesized that some metal stapes prostheses may be exposed to powerful MRI scanners without leading to potential adversities for patients., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Literature review, retrospective case review, and physician survey., <ovid:b>SETTINGS</ovid:b>: Tertiary care, University Medical Center., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: A review of the medical literature,a retrospective case review, and a clinical survey were performed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In the history of stapes prostheses, 1 adverse patient outcome was causally substantiated when a defective stapes prosthesis was exposed to an MRI field. Otherwise, a review of the literature on experiments investigating stapes prostheses and MRI fields revealed a lack of any adverse clinical reports. In addition, 2 physician's surveys revealed no other cases of symptoms or damage to the ears of patients with stapes prostheses that had been exposed to an MRI scanner., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: All patients with a metallic stapes prosthesis may be sent to the MRI scanner, with the exception of 1 specific defective prosthesis type. The exception is a 1987 accidental mismanufacture of several lots of McGee pistons with a magnetic alloy. Patients with these specifically identified lots of McGee pistons should go to a computed tomographic scanner or be reimplanted with another prosthesis if MRI scans are mandatory. It would be advisable for manufacturers to use nonferromagnetic metals such as titanium for production of future stapes prostheses.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To examine the efficacy and safety of mastoid cavity obliteration using highly purified beta-tricalcium phosphate (beta-TCP) after mastoidectomy in middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Thirteen patients with cholesteatoma invading the mastoid cavity or showing severe pathologic changes in the mastoid cavity., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Twelve patients underwent mastoid obliteration with highly purified beta-TCP during the first- and/or second-stage operation of a 2-stage canal-up operation: 5 patients during the first and second stages, and 7 patients during the second stage only. One patient with cholesteatoma underwent mastoid obliteration with highly purified beta-TCP during a 1-stage canal-up operation. In total, beta-TCP was applied in 18 ear operations., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: All patients underwent multislice computed tomography (CT) before and after surgery to assess the condition of the middle ear. The amount of residual beta-TCP granules in the mastoid cavity was assessed using the following granular shadow grading scale: Grade 0, no granular shadow in the mastoid cavity; Grade 1, residual granular shadows in part of the mastoid cavity; and Grade 2, granular shadows in most of the mastoid cavity. To assess any harmful effect of beta-TCP implanted in the mastoid cavity, continuous postoperative discharge and delayed wound healing were recorded. In addition, the bone conduction threshold was assessed using pure-tone audiometry, and the patients were asked whether they experienced vertigo or dizziness during the postoperative follow-up., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All the patients who underwent multislice CT less than 11.4 months after mastoid cavity obliteration with beta-TCP were Grade 2 on the granular shadow grading scale, whereas all those who underwent multislice CT more than 53.8 months after mastoid obliteration were Grade 0. No patient had continuous postoperative discharge, delayed wound healing, or extrusion of beta-TCP granules. No patient showed deterioration of the bone conduction threshold more than 10 dB after mastoid cavity obliteration with highly purified beta-TCP or complained of postoperative vertigo or dizziness., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Highly purified beta-TCP may be safe and reliable for mastoid obliteration. Highly purified beta-TCP may also be useful in other surgical procedures, including posterior wall reconstruction of the external auditory canal and scutum plasty.

N2  - <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The classification and hearing result reporting system of middle ear surgery provide a set of standard that otologic surgeons should comply with when they investigate the efficacy of procedures or report the post-operative results of middle ear surgery. Keeping up with this system will, in turn, facilitate and activate the evidence-based clinical research they would ask for., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The aims of the project were to establish the standardized classification nomenclature, to propose a guideline for the post-operative result reporting system, and to develop a database management program for middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Nine otologic surgeons from seven university hospitals in Korea carried out a field survey on the nation-wide status of middle ear surgery and its records, and also collected the information regarding international classification and result reporting system from 2001 through 2004. To make a consensus, it also underwent a process of public audit and, a questionnaire investigation, as well., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The classification of surgery consisted of four kinds of procedures of mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, extraneous procedures, and concurrent procedures. Post-operative hearing result reporting consisted of basic requirement and reporting guidelines of hearing success. The basic requirements stated minimum follow up duration, and computing formulae of pure tone average (PTA) and post-operative air bone gap (ABG). The reporting guidelines included criteria of hearing success (Post-operative ABG <or= 20 dB, hearing gain >or=15 dB, or hearing level <or=30 dB), post-operative ABG grading of excellent, good, no or poor improvement, and comparisons of hearing improvement among the groups. Next, a database management program was developed using the standardized classification and result reporting system. Structure of database is composed of 144 fields including patient information/preoperative findings (45 fields), operative findings (36 fields), operative procedures (29 fields), and post-operative follow up (23 fields).

N2  - <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Artificial middle ear mucosa (AMEM), a sheet of mucosal cells grown on collagen gel populated with fibroblasts, is useful as graft material that is able to promote mucosal regeneration after middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Regeneration of the middle ear mucosa and pneumatization of the mastoid cavity is critical for good prognosis. We examined whether implantation of AMEM into damaged middle ear cavity would promote mucosal regeneration., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: AMEM was prepared as described previously using epithelial cells and fibroblasts isolated from the rabbit middle ear. We implanted AMEM into rabbit middle ear from which mucosa had been surgically removed and evaluated its histological and functional recovery 8 weeks later. Three other groups were used for comparison: a normal control group, a mucosa-eliminated group, and a collagen-implanted group., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: AMEM grew to be morphologically similar to the native middle ear mucosa. Electron microscope studies showed that implanted AMEM has basal lamina and cilia. AMEM implantation suppressed bone hyperplasia and granulation, leading to better mucosal regeneration. Mucosal gas exchange was also significantly improved after implantation.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To compare the effects of esmolol and remifentanil, used as adjuncts for induced hypotension on surgical conditions and short-term cognitive functions, during tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The study was conducted in Hacettepe University, School of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey between January 2005 and December 2006 following Institutional Ethical Committee approval, 40 ASA I-II patients, between 18 and 60 years of age were included in this study. With the induction of anesthesia, for group E, an esmolol infusion of 50-250 ug.kg-1.min-1 was titrated, following a bolus of 0.5 mgxkg-1; for group R, a remifentanil infusion of 0.2-0.5 ugxkg-1xmin-1 was titrated; to achieve a mean blood pressure (BP) of 55-65 mm Hg. Arterial BP were recorded continuously throughout the operation. Mini Mental State Test (MMS) was performed at the preoperative 30th minute (MMSP), postoperative 30th minute (MMS30), 60th minute (MMS60) and 24th hour (MMS24). Surgical field was evaluated by the blinded surgeon, using a 6 point category scale., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Patient demographics were similar in both groups. Sustained controlled hypotension was sufficient in all of the groups throughout surgery. Surgical field scores were lower in group R (p<0.05), although the scores were </=2 in both groups, which was regarded as adequate for tympanoplasty. Four patients in group R (20%) and one patient in group E (5%) showed cognitive function decline between MMSP and MMS30. Within both groups, there were statistically significant differences between MMS60 and MMSP, MMS24 and MMSP, MMS60 and MMS30, MMS24 and MMS30, but the results were similar between the groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Remifentanil or esmolol provided adequate induced hypotension and similar operating conditions and their effects on cognitive functions in the short postoperative period are similar for tympanoplasty.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the quality of perceived sound in relation to the audiometric result after stapedotomy., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Ninety-eight patients with otosclerosis, who underwent stapedotomy between 2004 and 2005, participated in this retrospective study. Audiometric data were obtained before and after stapedotomy. Patients filled out two questionnaires: the Amsterdam Post Operative Sound Evaluation and the Operation Benefit Profile, which is based on the Glasgow Hearing Aid Benefit Profile., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There were 83 responders and 15 nonresponders; 83% indicated that their hearing was now better compared to preoperatively. The sounds that gave the highest percentage of distortion were "high pitched sound" (15%) and "loud sound" (13%). The groups with an air-bone gap of 0 to 10 dB and 10 to 20 dB report a relatively high number of patients who experience distortion. The audiometric data correlate well with the Operation Benefit Score., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Audiometric improvement does not necessarily mean an improvement in perceived sound and vice versa. But the audiometric outcome is significantly related to the patient's experienced handicap, benefit of the operation, residual difficulty, and overall satisfaction.

N2  - <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The improved biocompatibility of Bioverit II coated with a nanostructured surface shows promising qualities for use in human reconstructive middle ear surgery. In the case of chitosan-hydroxyapatite composite prostheses, further investigations regarding composition of the material, degree of purity and design are necessary before clinical application., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The selection of optimal materials for reconstructive middle ear surgery continues to be a problem. In the present study novel materials were tested as total ossicular replacement prostheses (TORPs) in an animal model., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Bioverit II coated with a nanostructured surface and chitosan-hydroxyapatite composites were placed in the middle ear of 40 rabbits. Uncoated Bioverit II was used as control. After an implantation period of 28, 84 or 300 days petrous bones were extracted, embedded in epoxy resin and examined by light microscopy., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Uncoated and coated Bioverit prostheses revealed a mucosal coverage and a little osseogenic response after 28 days. The results of the coated Bioverit prostheses slightly surpassed those of the plain prostheses. Chitosan-hydroxyapatite composite prostheses were mostly found to be dislocated after 28 days. Formations of granulation tissue and fibrotic capsules were observed around these implants. This reaction could be caused by the instability of the composite material or may be due to impurities present in the chitosan.

N2  - Patients with diffuse obliterative otosclerosis have more extensive footplate pathology than annular cases. As a result of this more skill is required for diffuse otosclerosis cases, and postoperative hearing results are usually worse than annular cases. In this retrospective study we compared the preoperative audiological features of annular and diffuse otosclerosis patients. The subjects were 60 patients with conductive hearing loss who had undergone stapedectomy. Annular and diffuse groups were comprised of 30 patients each. Annular otosclerosis was defined as the footplate pathology involving the annular ligament only, where the footplate of the stapes is very thin and retains its bluish color. On the other hand diffuse, obliterative otosclerosis was defined as the pathology involving the whole footplate and also in some cases extending beyond the confines of the annular ligament. In each group preoperative air- and bone-conduction levels at 125-6000 Hz and 500-4000 Hz were noted respectively. Average air-bone gap for the obliterative otosclerosis group was 37.5 dB; the same value for the annular group was 23.8 dB (p<0.05). The gap characteristics of the audiogram were different for the two groups. The annular group had an air-bone gap which was nearly constant for all the frequencies. In the diffuse otosclerosis group, the air-bone gap was more prominent in the low frequencies and it decreased at higher frequencies. No difference was noted in bone-conduction thresholds, and Carhart notch between the two groups. This study demonstrated that a large air-bone gap in patients with conductive hearing loss may be a sign of diffuse obliterative otosclerosis. This may warn the surgeon that a more challenging surgery is possible, and the patient may have a less favorable hearing result. Therefore, in the presence of a large air-bone gap, it may be appropriate to inform the patient of the strong possibility of diffuse otosclerosis.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: The sensorineural hearing loss (HL) after middle ear surgery has been explained by the noise generated by drilling, without considering the vibration generated by the burr., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The role of temporal bone vibration in the etiology of the HL was evaluated., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: An electromagnetic shaker was used to vibrate the bony external ear canal of guinea pigs at different frequencies ranging from 32 to 1,000 Hz and at intensities ranging from 4.2 to 18.8 m/s for 15 minutes. The hearing threshold was measured with auditory evoked responses. A total of 30 animals were tested., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: After vibration, 60% of the guinea pigs developed a threshold shift (TS) exceeding 10 dB at two frequencies, with average TS of 8.8 dB across all frequencies and animals. The exposure to vibration at higher frequencies (range, 500-1,000 Hz) produced stronger TS than did the exposure to lower frequencies (range, 32-250 Hz). The vibration-induced TS showed prominent recovery so that after 7 days, TS was 2.4 dB on average and 27 of 30 animals had recovered. After 14 days, the TS was 1.3 dB. The vibration excitation measurements showed that at lower frequencies, the vibration transmission into the skull was significantly greater than at higher frequencies, at which the transmission was heavily attenuated. There were no acoustic resonances detected in the skull. The frequency of vibration and the hearing frequency in auditory brainstem response were significant determinants in the model explaining the vulnerability of vibration on hearing. Hearing loss primarily occurred at higher frequencies. The HL was mostly reversible, consistent with the results observed after human temporal bone surgery., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: We conclude that in the guinea pig model, the temporal bone vibration at higher frequencies produced a more severe HL than did the vibration at lower frequencies, although the vibration at higher frequencies caused less efficient transmission from the vibrating probe to the temporal bone. The guinea pig model may be useful in the development of surgical techniques and in the understanding of temporal bone pathology.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To identify the 'stapedotomy' learning curve of 2 UK otolaryngologists., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A retrospective review of the outcome of the first 100 stapedotomy operations by each surgeon. Included in the study was a postal survey of the incidence of stapes surgery by UK otolaryngologists., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Two tertiary referral centres., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: All ears in which primary stapedotomy was performed for otosclerosis. Non-otosclerotic cases and malleus stapedotomy cases were excluded., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: One surgeon used the technique of small fenestra stapedotomy with either a Teflon wire or titanium piston, but without vein graft interposition, whilst the second employed the technique of stapedotomy with vein graft interposition, and a Teflon piston., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: The first 100 stapes operations performed by each surgeon were subdivided into consecutive groups of 10. Using a postoperative air-bone gap of 20 dB or better as a definition of 'success', the 'success rates' of each group were plotted on graphs - the learning curves. The end point of the learning curve was defined as the point 'where the curve reaches its plateau'., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The learning curves of both surgeons included 70-80 operations. Both surgeons had one 'dead ear' in their first 15 cases. The postal survey showed that some trainers only perform a small number of stapes surgeries, whereas some otolaryngologists who regularly perform stapedotomies were not trainers., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: This is a mismatch of trainers and trainees in stapes surgery. If the current trend of decline in stapes surgery continues, it will take many years for some otolaryngologists to complete their learning curves.

N2  - Nowadays, it is widely accepted that patients must be informed about the risks associated with any type of surgical procedure. Usually, the information provided consists of quoting a list of risks and their probability of occurrence based on data from the literature, and, more appropriately, the figures reflecting the surgeon's personal experience. As a rule, such data are sufficient to hold up in court in the event of a lawsuit, but may be insufficient to help patients make the most appropriate choice. We report two cases that presented complications following stapedotomy. Both cases had a sensorineural hearing loss and a vestibular deficit. This paper aims at describing the important psychological and social consequences of these complications. The potential impact of such complications on the quality of life and the projects for the future of these young patients was predictable. In order to better assist patients in choosing amongst options, we have taken action and modified our approach in advising our patients eligible for stapedotomy procedures.

N2  - Sensorineural hearing loss and/or vertigo are rare but severe complications of stapes surgery for otosclerosis, ranging from 0.2 to 3%. Management of such complications depends on the underlying cause: intravestibular protrusion of the prosthesis, perilymph fistula, labyrinthitis, and reparative granuloma extending into the vestibule. Surgery is mandatory in cases of intravestibular prosthesis or of persistent perilymph fistula. In cases of suppurative labyrinthitis or reparative granuloma extending into the vestibule, prognosis is usually poor, despite aggressive medical therapy or revision surgery. CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging can frequently help to determine the cause of the inner ear complication of stapedectomy. Demonstrative cases are presented to illustrate the prominent place of imaging in managing sensorineural complications of stapes surgery.

T1  - Microtraumatic stapedotomy.

Y1  - 2007//
N2  - Several modifications have been introduced during the 35 years following the first stapedectomy. The size of the footplate fenestration into the vestibule defines the type of the surgical technique, varying from total stapedectomy to partial stapedectomy or small fenestra stapedotomy. This paper presents a new microtraumatic modification of stapedotomy. After the incudostapedial joint is separated and following the fracture of the stapes crura, the stapes superstructure with the stapes tendon intact is left lying or bending on the promontory. Then, a 4.5-mm-long Schuknecht prosthesis is inserted and the oval window is sealed with small pieces of connective tissue filling the oval window niche and the area between the stapes crura. The results of the new microtraumatic technique with regard to hearing were similar to the standard small fenestra stapedotomy (closure of the air-bone gap). However, multifrequency tympanometry revealed that the new technique provides the patient with a complete physiological middle ear function postoperatively, which was not the case when the other stapedotomy techniques were used. This was reflected in a better hearing quality and less loud-noise intolerance reported by the patients who had been operated on with the new microtraumatic technique.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Inferior turbinate hypertrophy is one of the most common causes of nasal airway obstruction in children. Medical treatment often produces very little improvement. Radiofrequency therapy has recently been shown to be safe and effective in volumetric tissue reduction of the turbinates in adults, but no report has been published about its use in children. We prospectively evaluated the safety and effectiveness of radiofrequency volumetric tissue reduction (RVTR) for the treatment of nasal obstruction caused by inferior turbinate hypertrophy in children., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We followed up 93 children less than 9 years of age who underwent RVTR over 12 months. This surgery was performed with other procedures, such as tonsillectomy with or without grommet insertion (57 patients), tympanoplasty (10 patients), or grommet insertion alone (26 patients). Clinical examination, a medical questionnaire, and scores recorded pre- and postoperatively using Gertner-Podoshin plates were used to assess treatment outcomes 1 month, 6 months and 1 year after surgery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: No adverse effects were encountered. One primary bleed due to tonsillectomy was the only complication in this group. Eighty-seven children (94%) had significantly improved nasal breathing postoperatively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The results of this study demonstrate that RVTR is a safe, effective method for the treatment of turbinate hypertrophy in children. In addition, our data demonstrates good patient acceptance over a period of 1 year.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: This study was undertaken to assess a transcanal osteotome technique for removing symptomatic ear canal exostoses. Outcome measures included healing rates and the rate of complications., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective study in a private practice., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A straight 1-mm osteotome and a curved 1-mm osteotome were used by way of a transcanal approach to incrementally remove obstructive ear canal exostoses. If anterior or superior bone growths were closely approximating the tympanic membrane, they were partially removed with a 1.5 mm cylindrical end- and side-cutting burr. Healing rates were monitored with weekly postoperative visits., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Two hundred twenty-one ear canals (140 patients) were consecutively treated with this technique. Healing was achieved at 2 to 8 (average 3.50) weeks, with 90% healed by 4 weeks. There were 4 mobilizations of a full-thickness segment of anterior bony canal wall; 3 exposures of periosteum anterior to the anterior bony wall; 1 tear of the tympanic membrane requiring a tympanoplasty; 18 anterior and 11 posterior tympanic membrane tears that healed spontaneously; 3 instances of sensorineural hearing decrease; 3 cases of new-onset postoperative tinnitus; and 1 instance of postoperative positioning vertigo. There were no lacerations of the tympanic membrane by an osteotome, no facial nerve injuries, no soft tissue stenoses of an ear canal, and no skin grafting of an ear canal., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The described technique of using osteotomes transcanal for removal of symptomatic obstructive ear canal exostoses promoted rapid healing and was effective and safe.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: In modern reconstructive middle ear surgery imaging plays an essential role as a diagnostic tool, especially in pre-operative planning. Nowadays imaging of surgical results as a matter of quality control in post-operative follow-up becomes more important., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Conventional tomography was performed in 10 temporal bone specimen using the CommCat IS 2000-system in order to evaluate anatomical structures and inserted middle ear prostheses (PORP/TORP). This imaging technique has not been used in middle ear surgery beforehand., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Using conventional tomography characterization of anatomical structures of the temporal bone as e. g. the semicircular canals appeared to be of superior quality to comparable conventional radiographic imaging. Concerning imaging quality (contrast; resolution) conventional tomography allowed similar findings like computed tomography (CT)-scans in some of the investigated specimen while showing inferior sharpness quality due to technical reasons. Further advantages of conventional tomography in contrast to CT were the requirement of just 2.5 % of the CT's irradiation exposure, lack of metallic artefacts caused by implanted prostheses and the feasibility of distance- and angle-measurement of inserted prostheses towards the tympanic membrane which coincided extensively with the temporal bone preparation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Conventional tomography enables detailed anatomical imaging of the temporal bone region which outperforms conventional radiographic imaging, requires less irradiation dose than CT and helps avoid problems like metallic artefacts. This technique enhances immediate quality-control and seems to be therefore a promising tool for postoperative evaluation after reconstructive middle ear surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess chorda tympani nerve function before and after different types of middle ear surgery. The hypothesis was that in cases with cholesteatoma, iatrogenic injury to the nerve results in less postoperative taste disturbance than those undergoing myringoplasty or stapedectomy., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective questionnaire study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: ENT Department of a district general hospital in England., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Adult patients undergoing middle ear surgery in which there would be elevation of the anulus., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: Patients' change in taste sensation after surgery with follow-up to demonstrate subsequent recovery., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A significantly higher incidence of taste disturbance follows myringoplasty and stapedectomy than for procedures in which the initial diagnosis was cholesteatoma, regardless of the extent of injury sustained by the nerve. The most common complaint after chorda tympani nerve injury is of a metallic taste sensation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Despite the small patient cohort, the results support the hypothesis that iatrogenic chorda tympani nerve injury in surgery for cholesteatoma results in less postoperative taste disturbance than that for otosclerosis. This may be because the disease process of cholesteatoma renders the nerve hypofunctional. The situation after myringoplasty is less clear. A larger study may help validate these findings.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To analyze predictive factors of outcome after ossiculoplasty using a standard ossicular prosthesis system., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective review of 140 ossiculoplasties, performed by the same senior surgeon, with titanium prostheses., <ovid:b>SETTINGS</ovid:b>: Academic hospital and tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: All patients undergoing ossiculoplasty with Spiggle and Theis or Kurz titanium total and partial prostheses. Documented, postoperative follow-up had to be provided. A total of 129 patients (140 ears; 53 men and 76 women) were evaluated., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: These included ossiculoplasties using 75 Spiggle and Theis prostheses (30 partial and 45 total) and 65 Kurz prostheses (35 partial and 30 total)., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Mean preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps and the changes in mean hearing loss were analyzed using a four-frequency (500, 1,000, 2,000, and 3,000 Hz) pure tone average. Success rate was defined as postoperative air-bone gap within 20 dB. A one-way analysis of variance was used to analyze group differences. A multivariate statistical analysis was then undertaken to define the significant factors., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There were no statistical difference between the Spiggle and Theis and the Kurz prostheses. Multivariate statistical analysis has identified the predictive value of the presence or absence of the malleus handle and the mucosal status of the middle ear in the prognosis of ossiculoplasties., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Anatomical and technical factors diversely affect the functional outcome of tympano-ossiculoplasties. A better knowledge of their predictive value will enable accurate, preoperative, individual assessment when counseling patients with regard to the success of any proposed intervention. The use of these factors will also permit precise matching of future series to allow accurate comparisons.

We excluded patients with perforations associated with cholesteatomata, polyps, and acute infections. We administered a questionnaire discussing the options for the operation, and found most males preferred the endaural approach, and most females preferred the postaural approach., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: There was a significant preference by younger age groups for the postaural approach, especially younger females. They were more concerned about the site, visibility, and cosmetic result from the scar, and could camouflage the scar behind the pinna by hair or a traditional headscarf.

N2  - Positive surgical indications for an only hearing ear were evaluated in order to improve patients' quality of life. Fifteen cases of surgery involving an only hearing ear over the past eight years were retrospectively reviewed. Of eight perforated chronic otitis media cases, seven underwent type one tympanoplasty and one underwent simple underlay myringoplasty regardless of otorrhoea at the time of surgery. Of six cholesteatoma cases, two received the canal wall up method and four received the canal wall down method. Ossiculoplasty was carefully performed in six cases. Hearing was improved in seven cases, whereas it remained unchanged in seven cases and deteriorated in one case. Of nine patients, two did not need a hearing aid after surgery. Five patients with severe combined hearing loss (>90 dB) were able to communicate with a hearing aid, alleviating their anxiety regarding hearing loss. Only hearing ears with chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma can be successfully treated by tympanoplasty with or without ossiculoplasty.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To develop an ideal supportive packing material for ossiculoplasty, tympanoplasty, or other otologic procedures., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Several materials, namely, Carbylan-SX (P-C; Sentrx Surgical, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT), Gelfoam (P-GF; Pharmacia & Upjohn, Kalamazoo, MI), and Merogel (P-MG; Medtronics, Inc., Minneapolis, MN), were prepared and then placed into a Hartley guinea pig's (Elm Hill, Chelmsford, MA) middle ear cavities through a large myringotomy incision. The contralateral ear underwent a large myringotomy without packing material being placed. Preoperative and posteroperative auditory brainstem response studies were performed using Intelligent Hearing system software. The animals were examined weekly. Two weeks after packing placement, the animals were killed, and the temporal bones were harvested. Whole temporal bone sectioning was performed to analyze the presence of implant, surrounding inflammation, presence of osteoneogenesis and fibrosis, or adhesions., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All the materials, except the P-MG, were easy to place into the middle ear cavity. The P-MG contains woven strands that are difficult to trim into the small sizes needed for placement. The P-MG group had a smaller average amount of implant present compared with the other groups at 2 weeks. The degree of osteoneogenesis was similar among the P-GF, P-C, and P-MG groups. The P-MG and P-C groups contained the lowest amount of fibrosis between the implant and surrounding middle ear structures., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study demonstrates promising results with P-C as a potential supportive packing material for otologic procedures. P-C compares favorably with P-MG and P-GF in a guinea pig model with respect to ease of placement and amount of fibrosis.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To identify prognostic factors affecting outcome in lateral tympanoplasty for total or near-total tympanic membrane perforation., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective case series., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Patients were those presenting with total or near-total tympanic membrane perforation undergoing lateral tympanoplasty from 1999 to 2004. We systematically collected demographic, clinical, audiologic, and outcome information. Student t test was used to determine group differences. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between success of grafting (dependent variable) and the independent variables. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the relationship between postoperative air-bone gap (ABG) and independent variables., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There were seventy-seven cases (58 primary and 19 revision cases) with average follow-up of 17 months. Successful tympanic membrane grafting occurred in 91% of cases. None of the independent variables studied was predictive of the success of graft incorporation (P > .05). The mean preoperative ABG was 29.8 +/- 10 dB and improved to a postoperative ABG of 16.5 +/- 11 dB (P < .001). Smaller preoperative ABG and normal malleus handle were associated with smaller postoperative ABG. In revision cases, mastoidectomy was associated with better functional results., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Successful grafting of near-total and total tympanic membrane perforations occurred in 91% of the cases and was independent of demographic, disease, and technical variables. Disease variables (preoperative ABG and status of malleus handle) had a greater prognostic value on postoperative ABG than other variables. In revision tympanoplasty, mastoidectomy is associated with a better functional outcome.

T1  - Promontory drilling in stapedectomy: an anatomical study.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Anatomical variants such as an overhanging facial nerve or promontory can impede access to the footplate during stapedectomy. Drilling away bone from the cochlear promontory may be required. In the case of a floating or depressed footplate, it has been recommended that a "pothole" be drilled in the inferior margin of the oval window. There is little published information on the anatomy of the promontory with respect to these maneuvers., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Twenty temporal bones were studied. A series of measurements was made to assess how much bone may safely be removed without risking damage to the underlying cochlear endosteum and, hence, spiral ligament and stria vascularis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The bony promontory is thickest posteriorly, and here, the endosteum has least lateral projection. The promontory becomes thinner closer to the oval window. Moving anteriorly, the bone becomes thinner and the underlying endo steum more closely follows the bony contour. The stria vascularis and spiral ligament may be less than 0.2 mm inferior to the inferior margin of the oval window posteriorly. This distance is at least 0.3 mm at the midpoint of the footplate (range, 0.3-0.5 mm)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Bone may be removed inferiorly to the posterior one-third of the footplate from lateral to a line that makes an angle of 35 degrees with the superoinferior axis of the footplate. In creating a "pothole" in the case of a floating or depressed footplate, the authors recommend that it be created at the midpoint of the inferior margin of the oval window and should not exceed 0.3 mm in diameter.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate whether the performance of stapes surgery by residents during residency has decreased during the last 40 years, and if so, whether such a decrease has impacted the number of general otolaryngologists performing stapedectomy in the private practice setting., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Survey questionnaire of members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A short questionnaire was mailed to 1,700 members of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Data collected included age, year of residency graduation, fellowship (if any), practice setting, geographic location, number of stapedectomies performed in residency, and number of stapedectomies performed currently., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Seven hundred fifty-six (44%) of 1,700 surveys were returned; 558 (74%) of 756 respondents did not complete a fellowship and were included in the general otolaryngologist group. Overall, 41% of general otolaryngologists are performing stapes surgery. There was a significant decline in the number of resident stapedectomies performed between 1960 and 1986; since 1986, this number has plateaued to an average of 8 to 9 (self-reported) cases per resident. More recent graduation from residency trended toward decreased inclination to do stapedectomy, although the result was not statistically significant. Increasing number of stapedectomy cases performed in residency correlated with an increased likelihood of performing the operation in practice., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Despite a decreasing case volume of stapes surgery in residency, stapedectomy remains an operation performed by general otolaryngologists.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: The palisade tympanoplasties-technique with using of tragal and conchal autografts for reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and the auditory canal wall was described., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The operation started with the endaural incision. Tragal and conchal autograft palisade fragments with perichondrium for reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and the auditory canal wall have been used up to 1996 in 15,300 cases. We placed palisaded cartilage fragments parallel to the manubrium of the malleus in type I tympanoplasties and in type II or III procedures parallel to the long process of the incus. The "tunnel plasty" in the eustachian tubal entrance is performed with "simmering", "architrave" and "anti-architrave" to keep the tubal entrance open. This "tunnel plasty" results in a nice reconstruction of the tympano-meatal niche. The "annulus-stapes plate" in type III tympanoplasties replaces the function of the incus, crossing the promontory and reducing adhesions. This annulus-stapes bridge is fixed with a further palisade cartilage, "step plasty", which connects the "tunnel-plasty" with "annulus-stapes plate". The palisade-epitympanum-antrum plasty allows ventilation of the antrum via a tunnel constructed of well-fitting parallel pieces of cartilage fixed by self-tension (no glue) and replacing the bony canal wall. The "columella-tunnel plasty" has an L-shaped notch in the "annulus-stapes plate" fixing a columella of cartilage, placed in the oval window. Only in a case with a narrow oval window niche, a type IV palisade plasty can be performed or a prosthesis placed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The "annulus-stapes cartilage plate" is more stable reconstruction in type III tympanoplasties than are incus of foreign body interpositions. Adhesions on the promontory are found more often with fascia than with cartilage fragments. Histologic study of autograft cartilage showed good preservation of cartilage cells even 26 years after transplantation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The use of palisade cartilage technique brings very good functional and better long-term results.

N2  - The aim of this study was to assess and quantify the current surgical practice of ossiculoplasty among British otolaryngology consultants, using a postal questionnaire. Ossiculoplasty is not a very common procedure. It is only performed by otologists with a special interest in ossiculoplasty. Among the 280 respondents (response rate 51.9 per cent), only 179 (63.9 per cent) performed ossiculoplasty. The majority of the consultants (86.5 per cent) used artificial prostheses, and 63.7 per cent used patients' own ossicles (autografts). Most of the consultants (77.6 per cent) performed ossiculoplasty with primary tympanoplasty surgery rather than with primary cholesteatoma surgery (46.3 per cent). The majority of the consultants (50.8 per cent) performed less than 10 ossiculoplasties per year. This is the first survey on ossiculoplasty surgery in the United Kingdom.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The objective of this study was to analyze functional results after stapes surgery in patients with congenital nonprogressive conductive deafness resulting from an isolated fixation of the stapes according to age and surgical procedure., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: The authors conducted a retrospective case series from March 1993 to December 2003 in patients from two tertiary referral centers., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Twenty-eight patients were operated on by stapedotomy or partial stapedectomy using Teflon stapes prostheses. The median age at surgery was 14.2 years (range, 8.3-29.1 years). Main outcome measures were clinical and audiometric evaluation before and after surgery. Mean air conduction (MAC) and bone conduction (MBC) thresholds were recorded at 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz. The evaluation of functional outcome was based on the MAC gain, the MBC comparison, and the mean postoperative and residual air-bone gaps., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The median preoperative MAC was 50 dB (range, 19.0-65.0 dB) with a 35.0 dB median dB air-bone gap. With a mean follow up of 19 months, postoperative hearing improvement was statistically significant: median gain of 32.5 dB (P<.001) and median residual air-bone gap of 3.5 dB. The MBC was also statistically improved with median pre- and postoperative MBC of 11.5 and 6.5 dB, respectively (P<.001). Results were not dependent on the age group or type of surgery (stapedotomy or partial stapedectomy). No perceptive hearing loss was observed despite one gusher case., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Surgical treatment of isolated congenital stapes ankylosis allows good functional results regardless of age or type of surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to present our experience on facing the dehiscent high jugular bulb (HJB) during middle ear surgery in the past 2 decades., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective review., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Secondary referral hospital., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: From January 1982 to June 2002, consecutive 1,657 patients underwent surgical intervention for middle ear cleft diseases, a total of 1,857 operations. Of them, 10 ears (0.5%) in nine patients were proven to have dehiscent HJB during operation for adhesive otitis media in four ears and for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma in six ears., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Each patient underwent otoscopic examination, radiographic examination, and audiometry before and 6 months after operation., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Otoscopic examination revealed atrophic changes in the pars tensa with adhering to the promontory in two ears, attic retraction in one ear, and both findings in seven ears. All lesions were located beneath the basal turn of the cochlea and the round window niche at anteroinferior and/or posteroinferior quadrants. Active bleeding was encountered in two ears (20%) while elevating the tympanomeatal flap, which was treated by pressure compression associated with gelfoam sheet, then covered with an autologous cartilage to protect the dehiscent bulb. For the remaining eight ears, the bulbs were reinforced with fascia, perichondrium, or autologous cartilage. All 10 ears were allowed completion of the planned surgery without complications., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: HJB is not a contraindication for middle ear surgery. Awareness of this pitfall may lessen the operation risk.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: We evaluated the surgical outcome of tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media in post-irradiated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Nineteen ears were treated in 15 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who had undergone radiotherapy in this retrospective clinical series. Only patients with simple perforations of the tympanic membrane and normal or near-normal eustachian tube function were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent type I tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All patients had been treated with radiotherapy of 64.8 to 81.0 Gy. The intervals between radiotherapy and surgery ranged from 17 months to 20 years. The tympanic membranes in 10 of 19 ears were intact after surgery. Otorrhea had subsided in 11 ears (58%), and the incidence of otorrhea was decreased in 6 ears (32%). Thirteen of the 15 patients (86.7%) reported that their quality of life had improved., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Surgical intervention benefits some patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma with chronic otitis media resulting from radiotherapy.

N2  - The paper presents a comparative analysis of efficacy of ossiculoplasty (OP) using different transplants. A total of 202 operations were performed. Prostheses made of the fragments of the auditory ossicles, or a cortical layer of the temporal bone (n=81), of nail plate (n=56), titanium implants (n=65) were applied. A satisfactory result was achieved in 72-87% ossiculoplasties. Functional outcomes of OP did not vary significantly with type and material of the prosthesis. Main causes of poor OP results were fixation or displacement of the prosthesis with fibrous tissue; in case of titanium prostheses -- perforation of the tympanic membrane with prosthesis extrusion.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Adhesion formation following ossiculoplasty surgery has been implicated as a cause of the progressive deterioration of an initially good postoperative hearing result. Scar tissue between the partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (PORP) and adjacent middle ear structures is a common finding at revision surgery., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This study aims to investigate the effects of simulated scarring on the microacoustic transmission characteristics of a PORP in the fresh cadaveric human temporal bone., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Cortical mastoidectomy and extended posterior tympanotomy permitted access to reflective markers placed on the stapes footplate. A sound stimulus at 80 to 95 dB was presented to the closed external ear canal and displacements were measured with the laser Doppler vibrometer. PORPs were placed in cadaveric specimens, and the shaft of the prosthesis was cemented to the adjacent promontory using dental cement. Serial measurements were made from the stapes footplate as the adhesive was allowed to harden, a process that we have taken to simulate the gradual fixation of the prosthesis by scarring in the live patient., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There was a consistent reduction in stapes footplate displacement as the cement hardened., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The gradual adhesion of a PORP to the promontory produces a consistent reduction in microacoustic transfer to the stapes footplate in the fresh human cadaveric model.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The purposes of this study were to determine the prevalence of abnormalities in the mastoid cavity and middle ear in a nonotolaryngologic population and to correlate the results with clinical data., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective, cross-sectional study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: An academic tertiary care centre., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We evaluated 100 adults and 30 children from May to July 2003. Patients who had a history of mastoid or middle ear surgery or were presently suffering from otitis media were excluded. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted for the suspected intracranial pathology., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: The T2-weighted image was reviewed. The abnormality detected by MRI was divided into (1) mastoid cavity abnormality and (2) middle ear abnormality. All patients were asked to complete a questionnaire pertaining to the symptoms of the mastoid or middle ear pathology and the history of the otitis media. Also, their ears were examined carefully by an otoscope or otomicroscope., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In both groups, most of the abnormalities were found in the mastoid cavity. Analysis of the clinical data revealed that abnormal MRI findings of the mastoid cavity were significantly correlated to clinically significant mastoid or middle ear disease in adults., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Incidental MRI abnormalities in the mastoid cavity and middle ear detected in a nonotolaryngologic population were relatively uncommon compared with incidental paranasal sinus abnormalities. However, clinicians should remember the possibility of the pathologies that demand active treatment among these abnormalities, especially when a high signal abnormality is found in the mastoid cavity of an adult.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To identify the stapedotomy learning curve of two U.K. otolaryngologists., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A retrospective review of the outcome of first 100 stapedotomy operations by each surgeon. Included in the study was a postal survey of the incidence of stapes surgery by U.K. otolaryngologists., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Two tertiary referral centers., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: All ears in which primary stapedotomy was performed for otosclerosis. Nonotosclerotic cases and malleus stapedotomy cases were excluded., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: One surgeon used the technique of small fenestra stapedotomy with either a Teflon-wire or titanium piston but without vein graft interposition, whereas the second used the technique of stapedotomy with vein graft interposition and a Teflon piston., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: A moving average with a window of 15 dB was used to plot learning curves for the postoperative air-bone gaps. Using a postoperative air-bone gap of 20 dB or better as a definition of 'success,' the success rates with the increase in surgical experience of both surgeons were plotted on graphs, the learning curves. The end point of the learning curve was defined as the point where the curve reached its peak, and the results were sustainable., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There was no clear-cut end point in both learning curves, although it appears that there is a landmark point at 60 to 80 cases for both surgeons. Both surgeons also had one "dead ear" in their first 15 cases. The postal survey showed that some trainers only performed small numbers of stapes surgery, whereas some otolaryngologists who performed stapedotomies regularly were not trainers., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The study supports a learning curve in stapes surgery. To maximize the training opportunity of trainee surgeons, it may be advisable for learning centers to form network to provide target training for the trainee who has demonstrated the necessary dexterity and temperament of an otologist.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To present long-term results with a semi-implantable middle ear implant, the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB), and analyze pre- and post-operative results of audiologic tests., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective chart review with additional patient interview and audiologic testing., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: One tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>SUBJECTS</ovid:b>: Twenty patients who met the selection criteria of the manufacturer were evaluated at least two years after implantation., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Monaural Implantation of the VSB in 20 patients, in two of these 20 patients implantation of the second ear in a second stage., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Assessment of benefit and satisfaction using the standardized International Outcome Inventory for Hearing Aids, the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, and Visual Analogue Scales in all patients. Fifteen patients agreed to undergo audiologic testing at follow-up including pure-tone- and speech audiometry in silence and noise. The majority of patients (13/20) reported to be satisfied or very satisfied with the VSB. Aided speech perception was comparable between the VSB and the hearing aid preoperatively. When compared to the preoperative audiograms, residual hearing from 0.5-4 kHz was significantly worse in the operated ear with 8 dB (Wilcoxon signed rank test p < 0.001) but only 2.6 dB in the non-operated ear (Wilcoxon signed rank test, p > 0.05). Major surgical complications did not occur. Permanent alteration in taste occurred in three patients and revision surgery was necessary in another three patients., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Satisfaction with the VSB was not superior to conventional hearing aids in subjective and in audiometric terms. Because of its impact on residual hearing and the requirement of implantation middle ear surgery, implantation of the VSB should be limited to patients with relevant side effects of hearing aids, e.g., severe chronic otitis externa.

N2  - Pleomorphic adenoma (PA) rarely occurs in the external auditory canal (EAC). A case of PA complicated with chronic otitis media is reported. The patient was a 36-year-old male who began to experience a hearing loss in the left ear in 1996. He sought medical attention only after ear pain developed in April 2003. At the initial examination, a tumor covered by smooth skin was seen filling the left EAC. Pure-tone audiometry showed residual hearing at low frequencies and scale-out across middle to high frequency range. The CT and MRI findings led to a diagnosis of a tumor of the left EAC complicated with an inflammatory middle-ear lesion. The tumor was excised en bloc with the overlying skin, and tympanoplasty was performed. The pathological diagnosis was PA of the left EAC and inflammatory granuloma of the middle ear.

N2  - The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate the relation between audiometric and psychometric measures after tympanoplasty from the perspective of preoperative selection of patients and postoperative assessment of the results of reconstructive middle ear surgery. Hearing (dis)ability was measured by means of pure-tone audiometry and a validated self-assessment questionnaire: the (modified) Amsterdam Inventory of Auditory Disability and Handicap (m)AIAD. Average hearing thresholds and (m)AIAD scores were evaluated for 80 patients, pre- and 12 months postoperatively. The average improvement of the air conduction threshold in the operated ear was 5.4 (+/-14.3) dB; the average improvement in the (m)AIAD score was 2.9 points (+/-12.1). Although not very strong, the audiometric improvement and increase in (m)AIAD score are significantly related. After the calculation of postoperatively measured mean scores on the (m)AIAD for different 10-dB intervals of postoperative hearing loss averaged over both ears, an interesting relation between the (m)AIAD score and hearing losses emerges. The (m)AIAD score is almost independent of hearing loss for postoperative hearing levels between 25 and 40 dB. Residual hearing loss has to become less than 25 dB before a smaller hearing loss corresponds with a higher (better) (m)AIAD score. For losses larger than 40 dB the (m)AIAD score clearly decreases with increasing hearing loss. Finally, even small residual hearing losses lead, on average, to (m)AIAD scores that are substantially lower than the score for normally hearing subjects. In general, the patient benefit seems related to the magnitude of improvement in the air-conduction thresholds, rather than to the achievement of a certain threshold level. In addition, even small residual hearing losses (less than 25 dB HL) still lead, on average, to (m)AIAD scores that are substantially lower than the scores for normally hearing subjects.

N2  - Stapedotomy is primarily performed to treat hearing loss secondary to otospongiosis, although some patients find that the accompanying tinnitus is more bothersome than the hearing loss. We prospectively studied 23 consecutive patients with tinnitus secondary to otospongiosis who had undergone stapedotomy, and we compared their pre- and postoperative medical and audiologic findings. Patients' annoyance with their tinnitus was quantified by means of a visual analog scale, and their air-conduction thresholds were determined by measurements of a 4-frequency pure-tone average (0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz). Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t test and Fisher's exact test. In the group as a whole, the mean tinnitus annoyance visual analog scores were 8.34 preoperatively and 1.56 postoperatively, a highly significant difference. Clinically, 22 of the 23 patients (95.7%) achieved satisfactory control of their tinnitus (improvement or complete resolution) following stapedotomy. With respect to hearing loss, all patients clinically improved postoperatively, and audiometry confirmed improvement at all 4 frequencies between 0.5 and 4 kHz. An air-bone gap of less than 10 dB was noted in 17 patients (73.9%). We conclude that in addition to improving hearing, stapedotomy also provides good control of tinnitus.

N2  - <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The epidemiological characteristics of otosclerosis and its treatment in Andalusia resemble those of other populations with similar socioeconomic levels. Two complementary approaches, such as questionnaires and pure-tone audiometry, are required to assess the effectiveness of otosclerosis surgery (OS) reliably and precisely., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: We describe a new method to assess effectiveness in OS. It is based on the results of pure-tone audiometry and a specially designed quality of hearing questionnaire (QHQ). The objectives of the study are: (i) to report the general epidemiologic profile of otosclerosis in Andalusia; (ii) to study the effectiveness of OS in our community using conventional methods; and (iii) to study the outcomes of OS using the QHQ and to compare them to those obtained using conventional methods., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: All 31 hospitals in the public healthcare system of Andalusia were studied. They were graded into four groups using a specially designed grouping system. The data were obtained from the minimum basic dataset. The prevalence of otosclerosis in Andalusia was calculated from the incidence data, the duration of the disease and life expectancy. To assess the effectiveness of OS, 475 clinical records from 15 hospitals representing all 4 groups were analysed. Effectiveness was assessed by conventional methods, using data obtained from pure-tone audiometry, and by using version 1.02 p of the QHQ., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The incidence of clinical otosclerosis was 5.67 patients/100,000 inhabitants/year. The calculated prevalence was 0.287%. The number of cases increased progressively during the study period (p<0.001). The 15-45-year age group was the largest (62.2%) and 68.4% of patients were females. The most frequent type of otosclerosis was estapediovestibularis (fenestral), non-obliterative (91.8%). Only 48 cases (2.3%) of cochlear and 45 (2.2%) of obliterative otosclerosis were reported. The most frequently employed therapeutic procedures were stapedectomy and stapedotomy (75.70%). The average total and preoperative lengths of stay were 3.59 and 1.04 days, respectively. There were significant differences between the different types of otosclerosis. Improvement in the air-bone gap was 15.37+/-1.19 dB (n=164) and the overclosure or operative damage was 0.49+/-0.85 dB (n=164). A gap improvement of 10-40 dB was observed in 61.4% of patients. The > 65 years age group showed the best gap improvement but the largest variability. The quality of hearing measured by the QHQ showed that, in general, a better gap improvement was associated with a higher quality of hearing (Pearson correlation r=0.183; p<0.05). The 15-45-year age group had the worst gap improvement but, in contrast, the better quality of hearing.

N2  - <ovid:b>PURPOSE OF REVIEW</ovid:b>: Reconstruction of the tympanic membrane is a common procedure in otology today. Many different materials have been used for this purpose, including a wide array of autologous tissues. This article focuses on the use of human acellular allograft dermal matrix (AlloDerm, LifeCell Corporation, Branchburg, New Jersey) in tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>RECENT FINDINGS</ovid:b>: The choice of graft materials has expanded to include human dermal allograft tissue. Recent reports show promising results for AlloDerm reconstruction of the tympanic membrane, including animal experiments and in humans., <ovid:b>SUMMARY</ovid:b>: AlloDerm has become an acceptable alternative to the use of autologous tissues in tympanic membrane surgery, particularly in type I tympanoplasty. This paper discusses the recent literature on the topic, outlines the authors' experience with the use of AlloDerm, and describes the authors' operative technique.

Bone conduction was slightly impaired after operation and hearing improved after a revision myringoplasty performed for reperforation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Erosion of the bone of the labyrinth can also be observed in noncholesteatomatous otitis media. The presence of a fistula is not always associated with profound hearing loss. Overlying pathologic tissue can be removed without damaging the membranous labyrinth.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: A cross-sectional observational study was designed to evaluate patient satisfaction after stapedotomy., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Two validated questionnaires, the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS) and the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI), were used to assess patients for whom audiometric data were available., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The response rate was 79%. The PIADS score showed that 96% of patients reported an improvement in quality of life. The HHI score, however, showed that 32% of patients still experienced a marked degree of handicap after surgery. The HHI scores correlated positively with postoperative audiometric data, and the PIADS scores correlated positively with the degree of change in audiometric data., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The results of this study support the role of small fenestra stapedotomy as a primary treatment for otosclerosis. The study also identifies a certain subpopulation of patients with residual handicap who may require further aural rehabilitation.

Y1  - 2005//
N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To present the experiences of cochlear implantation (CI) in patients with otitis media-related lesions., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: Of the 9 patients with otitis media-related lesions studied for cochlear implantation, one was implanted cochlear in second-stage operation after mastoidectomy and received reconstruction of the posterior ear canal wall with cartilage with perichondrium; one with chronic otitis media (perforation) had CI and tympanoplasty with cartilage with perichondrium in one-stage operation; three with silent otitis media had CI and modified mastoidectomy in one-stage operation; three with mastoid dysplasia and middle ear adhesions had CI and tympanic exploration in one-stage operation; one with cholesteatoma localizedin attic had CI and atticotomy and reconstruction with cartilage with perichondrium., <ovid:b>RESULT</ovid:b>: All devices worked properly. There were no otitis media-related complications., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Patients with chronic suppurative otitis media must have all disease eradicated and do the utmost to reserve anatomic landmark before CI. Patients with silent otitis media can have CI in one-stage operation, if the drainage of Eustachian tube, attic and antrum is satisfying. Patients with cholesteatoma localizedin attic can have CI in one-stage operation, but it is necessary to remove all lesions and reconstruct attic. The infection maybe an important cause of mastoid dysplasia and serious sensorineural deafness. Implanting electrode though the ear canal and promontony is a good method if the mastoid is sclerotic type and it is too difficult to implant though the facial recess. In order to avoid the retraction of drum and electrode dropping off, we can use cartilage with perichondrium to rebuild the drum, the posterior ear canal wall and the attic.

However, the use of such a rigid material in tympanic membrane reconstruction causes controversies as to the audiologic aspect. The purpose of this study was to assess overall and frequency-specific hearing results after primary cartilage tympanoplasty with island technique in comparison to the hearing results after primary tympanoplasty with temporalis muscle fascia., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING</ovid:b>: This study was a retrospective review of selected cases between 1999 and 2002. Primary cases with intact ossicular chain, normal middle ear mucosa, and subtotal perforation of the tympanic membrane were included in the study. Fifteen patients were in the cartilage group, whereas 10 patients were in the fascia group. Preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps at the frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were compared., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Both groups were statistically similar on the aspect of the severity of middle ear pathology and the preoperative hearing levels. Mean postoperative gains in air-bone gap were 11.9 dB for the cartilage group and 11.5 dB for the fascia group. There were no statistically significant differences in the postoperative frequency-specific gains in air-bone gap between the 2 groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Although cartilage is the ideal grafting material in problem cases, its comparable acoustic properties, especially in the form of cartilage island, to those of fascia will allow a more liberal application in less severe cases, in which functional outcome is more essential.

N2  - The objective of this study is to determine the nature, duration and severity of chorda tympani symptoms in post-stapedotomy patients when the nerve has been known to have either sustained surgical manipulation or division. The study design was retrospective and blind, based at a tertiary Otology Referral Center (Gloucestershire Royal Hospital). All successive patients undergoing stapedotomy operated upon by the senior author (JMR) between November 1991 and October 1998 were included. The main outcome measures were postoperative graded dysgeusia (questionnaire) and post operative electrogustometry score, comparing the chorda tympani cut group and the chorda tympani preserved group. Sixty stapedotomies were performed in the study period. After a minimum interval of 8 months, questionnaire data were obtained in 55/60 (92%), and electrogustometry studies were carried out in 48/60 (80%). Symptoms of dysgeusia were experienced in the chorda tympani nerve cut (CC) group in 95% and in the chorda preserved (CP) group in 52%. For those with symptoms, duration was 6.7 months (+/-4.9 SD) and 3.4 months (+/-3.7 SD) for the CC and CP groups, respectively. From the electrogustometry data, after 8 months, the risk of total loss of response is significantly higher in CC patients (94%) than in CP patients (25%) (P = 0.0001). Also at 8 months, 54% of CP patients had normal ipsilateral electrogustometry responses compared with 6% in the CC group. In conclusion, cutting the chorda tympani results in significantly greater symptoms than when subjected to manipulation only, and these symptoms are likely to be more long lasting. Therefore, it is our recommendation that where possible the chorda be preserved. The risk of severe chorda symptoms when the chorda is cut is small (<5%). Preoperative consent to include dysgeusia is advised.

N2  - Despite the wide variety of ossiculoplasty techniques that are available, success rates are limited. Current use indicates that surgeons prefer ceramic, autograft bone, and plastic pore prostheses. During the past decade, titanium prostheses have been used with great promise. Although their use is not widespread, satisfaction rates are high. An earlier study of ossiculoplasty showed that titanium prostheses were effective in reducing conductive hearing loss. To date, the surgical-handling attributes of titanium middle ear prostheses have not been assessed. We report the results of our survey of 32 otologic surgeons who used the open Tubingen titanium prosthesis for primary and revision ossiculoplasty during tympanoplasty in 400 patients at 12 academic and nonacademic otolaryngology clinics, most of them in Germany. Because the audiometric efficacy of titanium prostheses has been previously reported, our primary outcomes measures included ease of use with respect to the amount of time required to prepare the implants for placement and the surgeons' overall impression of the intraoperative handling characteristics of the implants, taking into consideration factors such as positioning, length adjustment, visibility, and the stability of the coupling. Surgeons also compared the properties of the titanium implant with those of gold, ceramic, and autograft implants that they had used in the past. Based on the results of 383 of the 400 ossiculoplasties, our survey revealed that the titanium implant was significantly superior to the others in all measured respects.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: There are transmastoid, transtemporal and combined approaches for surgical management of endaural encephaloceles. The advantages of a transmastoid approach are the exploration and option of surgical treatment of the middle ear cavity without craniotomy. Nevertheless there are recent studies preferring the transtemporal or combined approach because of the better survey., <ovid:b>PATIENT</ovid:b>: We present a 27-year old male patient, who developed hearing loss and otorrhea of the right side. He underwent middle ear surgery associated with cholesteatoma three times before. On examination there was a smooth pulsatile mass taking origin in the roof and almost filling the external auditory canal. High-resolution CT and MRI scans of the petrous bone demonstrated a spherical soft tissue mass communicating with the middle cranial fossa. The encephalocele was exposed and resected through a transmastiodal approach. Behind the cele a relapsing cholesteatoma was found and resected in the same session. The laterobasilar defect was sealed with ear cartilage and a perichondrium flap., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: There are three different surgical approaches to manage laterobasilar encephaloceles. Due to the history of a previous cholesteatoma we performed a transmastoidal approach. A transtemporal approach alone would have failed to notice the relapsing cholesteatoma and would have led to a greater trauma.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to measure the mass loading effect of an active middle-ear implant (the Vibrant Soundbridge) in cadaver temporal bones., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Implantable middle ear hearing devices such as Vibrant Soundbridge have been used as an alternative to conventional hearing aids for the rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss. Other than the obvious disadvantage of requiring implantation middle ear surgery, it also applies a direct weight on the ossicular chain which, in turn, may have an impact on residual hearing. Previous studies have shown that applying a mass directly on the ossicular chain has a damping effect on its response to sound. However, little has been done to investigate the magnitude and the frequency characteristics of the mass loading effect in devices such as the Vibrant Soundbridge., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Five fresh cadaver temporal bones were used. The stapes displacement was measured using laser Doppler vibrometry before and after the placement of a Vibrant Soundbridge floating mass transducer. The effects of mass and attachment site were compared with the unloaded response. Measurements were obtained at frequencies between 0.1 and 10 kHz and at acoustic input levels of 100 dB sound pressure level. Each temporal bone acted as its own control., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Placement of the floating mass transducer caused a reduction of the stapes displacement. There were variations between the bones. The change of the stapes displacement varied from 0 dB to 28 dB. The effect was more prominent at frequencies above 1,000 Hz. Placing the floating mass transducer close to the incudostapedial joint reduced the mass loading effect., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The floating mass transducer produces a measurable reduction of the stapes displacement in the temporal bone model. The effect is more prominent at high frequencies.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Assess the safety of performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on patients with stapes prostheses., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Survey and animal model., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A survey regarding implant usage, MRI procedures, and adverse outcomes after MRI in patients previously undergoing stapes procedures. Guinea pigs implanted with ferromagnetic 17 to 4 stainless steel, 316L nonferromagnetic stainless steel, titanium, and fluoroplastic stapes prostheses underwent a MRI in a 4.7 Tesla MR system., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Three adverse outcomes were reported on the clinical survey. One adverse event occurred during an MRI performed on a recalled ferromagnetic prosthesis. The other two adverse events were probably not secondary to MRI exposure. No damage or inflammation was observed in the region of the oval window or vestibule of implanted guinea pigs exposed to a 4.7 Tesla MR system., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The combination of prior studies, the clinical survey, and the absence of histopathologic evidence of damage in the guinea pigs is compelling evidence that MRI for patients with stapes prostheses is safe. Implanting physicians should feel comfortable clearing a patient for a MRI in a 1.5 Tesla or 3.0 Tesla MRI. It is imperative for the physician to qualify the field strength when clearing a patient to undergo a MRI.

N2  - We prospectively studied 48 otosclerosis patients over a 2-year interval. Forty-four had stapedotomy, and four had stapedectomy. Demographics, clinical history, and pre- and postoperative audiometry results were recorded. A questionnaire asking about tinnitus (intensity, pitch) and including a visual analog scale quantifying the degree (1-10) of annoyance caused by the tinnitus was completed pre- and postoperatively (4-10 months and 14-48 months, respectively). Ninety-one percent of the otosclerosis patients reported the presence of tinnitus, and 39.58% reported severe disabling tinnitus (SDT; 7-10 on the visual analog scale). High-pitch (whistle) tinnitus was present in most patients, and white noise (radio static, waterfall, rain) was present in others. No patient described the tinnitus as a low-tone noise (buzzing). Ninety-one percent of patients reported tinnitus reduction or total remission after surgery. Ten of 19 patients with SDT reported complete remission of tinnitus, 7 reported improvement postoperatively, and 2 reported no change. No patient reported worsening of tinnitus. Small postoperative air-bone gaps (four tonal average) correlated with remission or reduction of tinnitus in SDT patients. Tinnitus pitch, gender, and age of patients were not related to decrease of tinnitus postoperatively. A larger preoperative air-bone gap correlated with larger reduction of tinnitus after successful surgery. A lower preoperative bone conduction level correlated with more intense tinnitus before surgery and greater reduction postoperatively. We contacted 25 patients from 14 to 48 months after surgery, and all reported that their tinnitus status had not changed since the early follow-up. Tinnitus is very prevalent in otosclerosis patients; almost one-half of patients have SDT preoperatively, and stapes surgery improves this symptom in 91% of cases. Preoperative air-bone gap and bone conduction level and a postoperative airbone gap seem to influence the degree of postoperative tinnitus reduction.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: This prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was designed to compare the effects of desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane when combined with remifentanil for induced hypotension on surgical conditions and operative field during tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Sixty patients undergoing tympanoplasty were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized into three groups of 20 each to receive the inhalation anaesthetics desflurane, isoflurane or sevoflurane. Propofol 2 mg kg(-1) was administered for induction of anaesthesia in all groups. All patients received a continuous infusion of remifentanil which was titrated between 0.2 and 0.5 microg kg(-1) min(-1) to achieve a mean blood pressure (BP) of 60-70 mmHg. Nitroglycerine was infused if this BP could not be achieved. Arterial pressures were recorded continuously throughout the operation. Surgical conditions were assessed every 20 min by the blinded surgeon using a six-point category scale (0-5)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: One patient in the desflurane group and two patients in isoflurane group required nitroglycerine to maintain desired mean BP. Sustained controlled hypotension was sufficient in all of the groups throughout surgery. Category scale scores were < or =3 throughout the study, except one patient in the sevoflurane group who had a score of 4 at the 60th minute of the operation. No difference was found among groups when haemodynamic parameters and surgical category scale scores were compared. There were no postoperative respiratory and circulatory complications., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Desflurane, sevoflurane or isoflurane combined with remifentanil provided adequate induced hypotension and similar operating conditions and any of them could be safely and equally used in anaesthesia for tympanoplasty.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: In the year 2000, the Otological Society of Japan proposed a new criteria to assess the levels of hearing known as Criteria 2000. However, these criteria are intended to assess pure tone threshold after tympanoplasty and the results do not necessarily reflect the hearing condition from the patient's perspective. Thus, it is essential to study the relationship between the subjective evaluation of post-operative hearing based on the patient's own assessment and the objective assessment by audiometry., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The present study is a questionnaire-based survey on the levels of post-operative hearing in 460 patients whose degree of satisfaction with their levels of hearing was assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS). The hearing level was assessed based on the Criteria 2000 established by the Otological Society of Japan., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The post-operative results indicated a success rate of 78.7%. According to the questionnaire-based survey, 64.4% patients considered their hearing as "improved". The average VAS score was the highest in the "improved" group and gradually decreased when in the "deteriorated" group. The highest success rate was obtained in patients who assessed their hearing as "improved" and the lowest rate was seen in those who assessed their hearing as "deteriorated". On the other hand, the success rate in the three groups, "slightly improved", "unchanged", and "slightly deteriorated", was almost similar and did not relate to the objective audiometry findings. Therefore, except for the "improved" and deteriorated" groups, there is no relation between the subjective self-assessment and the objective post-operative hearing., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: A bi-directional approach, one from an audiological (objective) and one from the patient's perspective (subjective), especially using VAS, is quite useful for the post-operative assessment of hearing.

N2  - The objective of this study was to evaluate, over the long-term, the anatomic and functional outcome of canal wall-down mastoidectomy performed for chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma and chronic otomastoiditis resistant to all conservative treatment. The study was made through a retrospective review of 338 cases of consecutive primary canal wall-down mastoidectomies performed between 1974 and 1998. Included were 259 cases with sufficient data. In all cases, functional reconstruction was performed at the same time as the mastoidectomy. Demographic and clinical data were collected from each file. From the clinical data, the surgical techniques, complications, the number of follow-up visits necessary to ensure cavity cleanliness, details of care provided over the period 1 to 24 years (mean, 7 years) after the operation, and audiometric data from admission and from the latest postoperative follow-up were retained. Canal wall-down mastoidectomies were followed up an average of 10 times during the first 6 months after operation, twice a year over the 6-year period following surgery, and less than twice a year beyond the 6-year period. Care was dispensed for meatal stenosis, scars, infections, polyps, and beads of cholesteatoma. Surgical revisions were performed because of residual or recurrent cholesteatoma in 6.1% of the cases, because of perforation of the tympanic membrane in 7.3% of the cases, and to improve hearing in 12.2% of the cases. At the last consultation, 1 to 24 years after surgery, cavities were found to be dry and self-cleaning in 95% of the cases, and still humid, with otorrhea, in 5% of the cases. Over the long-term, the hearing threshold remained unchanged in 41.3% of the cases. It was improved after surgery by 10 to 19 dB in 15.4% of the cases, by 20 to 29 dB in 11.5% of the cases, and by more than 29 dB in 3.8% of the cases. The hearing threshold was thus improved or at least remained unchanged in 72.0% of cases. Hearing losses occurred in 28% of the cases: by 10 to 19 dB in 11.9%, by 20 to 29 dB in 6.5%, and by more than 29 dB in 9.2% of the cases. A sensorineural hearing loss of more than 60 dB at all frequencies occurred immediately after the operation in 2 cases (0.7%). There was 1 case of facial paralysis (0.3%). Four patients (1.5%) complained of persistent vertigo. Canal wall-down mastoidectomy is an adequate treatment for chronic otitis with cholesteatoma or chronic otomastoiditis. The anatomic and functional results are satisfactory, and the rate of complications is acceptably low. A tympanoplasty can be performed simultaneously. Thus, for the large majority of patients, only a single intervention is required; however, a small minority can benefit from a revision tympanoplasty. In order to obtain these results, both the patient and the surgeon should engage in a long-term follow-up.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To describe an effective technique for mastoid cavity obliteration in canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy for chronic otitis media and review its efficacy in producing a dry, low-maintenance, small mastoid cavity., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective clinical study of a consecutive series of procedures from 1995 to 2000., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center and institutional academic practice in otology and neurotology., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Sixty consecutive procedures for active chronic otitis media with a minimum follow-up of 12 months (mean, 31 mo; range, 12-80 mo)., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: All patients had canal wall down mastoidectomy with simultaneous tympanoplasty including split-thickness skin grafting. An inferiorly pedicled, periosteal-pericranial flap was used in conjunction with autologous bone pate to obliterate the mastoid cavity. The additional length provided by the pericranial extension of the flap permitted it to reach superior to the lateral canal and into the sinodural angle, with improved coverage of bone pate and better reduction of cavity size., <ovid:b>OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: The primary outcome measure was control of suppuration and creation of a dry, low-maintenance mastoid cavity, which was assessed using a previously developed semiquantitative scale. This scale includes a temporal dimension to assess control of infection. Secondary outcome measures included postoperative complications (i.e., hematoma, infection, flap necrosis, and meatal stenosis) and incidence of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Forty-nine ears (82%) maintained a small, dry, healthy mastoid cavity. Five ears (8%) had intermittent otorrhea easily controlled by topical treatment. Six ears (10%) had suboptimal control of otorrhea, of which four had meatal stenosis. There were no residual or recurrent cholesteatomas. Outcomes remained stable over progressively longer follow-up, up to 80 months., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Obliteration of a canal wall down mastoid cavity by a postauricular periosteal-pericranial flap with autologous bone pate is a reliable and effective technique that results in a dry, trouble-free mastoid cavity in 90% of patients with active chronic otitis media.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - This study investigates the test-retest distributions and the interval for true score change of the (modified) Amsterdam Inventory for Auditory Disability and Handicap [(m)AIAD], when the latter is used to measure the effect of an intervention. In a previous study the reliability and validity of the (m)AIAD in a cohort of hearing impaired patients were found to have satisfactory high values. In this prospective study, 66 patients underwent a tympanoplasty operation. Preoperatively and postoperatively pure tone audiometry was performed, and at the same time the subjective hearing ability was established by means of the (m)AIAD. The correlation between threshold change and score change was 0.35 (Pearson's r). Scores on the (m)AIAD had to change by at least 16 to be qualified as a true change. For only nine of 66 subjects this criterion was fulfilled. No clear relation exists, except for these nine subjects, between threshold change and score change in this patient population. The study also shows that disability questionnaires have their limitations, when using them to measure the result of a medical intervention in an individual patient.

Between September 1998 and October 2000, 23 titanium middle ear implants (23 TORP) were used for reconstruction of the ossicular chain after tympanomastoidectomy. Preliminary functional results were obtained in 23 cases., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Average follow-up time was 18 months (range, 12-40) and no adverse reactions or extrusions occurred. Seven of 16 canal wall down tympanoplasties (43.7%), and 3 of 7 canal wall up tympanoplasties performed (42.9%) had a postoperative air-bone gap of between 0 and 10 dB., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Preliminary results show that titanium prosthesis provide a promising hearing result after total ossicular reconstruction, although long-term results are not yet available. The low weight of these prostheses may be the reason for the decrease in the air-bone gap.

As the population ages, the otologist should expect to perform more surgeries on elderly patients. Short- and long-term hearing results after primary stapes surgery are good, regardless of age. Approximately 90% of patients obtain closure of their ABG to within 10 dB. Long-term results demonstrate that hearing decreases over time after stapedectomy at a rate of approximately 1 dB/y for both young and elderly populations. Sensorineural hearing loss accounts for most of this decrease and a relatively small ABG is maintained in many patients. However, at least 10 to 20% of patients will redevelop conductive hearing loss after undergoing stapes surgery and will desire revision surgery to correct this hearing loss. With modern otologic equipment, including the laser, most patients undergoing revision stapedectomy should obtain significant improvement in hearing, regardless of age., <ovid:b>SUMMARY</ovid:b>: Primary and revision stapedectomy are beneficial procedures in the elderly population. The success rate is similar to that in the younger population with otosclerosis.

N2  - Since the publication of Miodonski, Zollner and Wullstein different methods and grafting materials have been promoted in tympanoplasty. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the anatomical and functional results of tympanoplasty in comparison with the material used. The studies included a selected group of 142 patients who were operated on because of perforation of tympanic membrane. The analysed group consisted of 112 patients when perichondrium and cartilage were used to reconstruct the tympanic membrane. The comparison group consisted of 30 patients when fascia of the musculus temporalis was used to close a defect of the eardrum. In all cases before and after operation there was made tonal audiometry with indication for air and bone conduction within range from 500 to 4000 Hz, verbal audiometry after operation with indication of speech detection and speech reception threshold using mono-syllable NLA-93 test, tympanometry after operation and evaluation of anatomical results after surgery. The comparison of operation results showed that there was no significant difference between the two groups.

N2  - Specialist training at the registrar grade in the United Kingdom has undergone significant change in the recent past. One of the effects has been a reduction in the length of time spent in training. This and the application of the European working time directive have the potential to reduce trainees' surgical exposure. The proportion of tympanic membrane procedures performed by reconstructive otolaryngology registrars in the Grampian University hospitals was audited to monitor the impact of these changes. Case notes of all patients who underwent myringoplasty or tympanoplasty between July 1998 and June 1999 were analysed retrospectively. Details of the surgeons' grade were recorded. The proportion of myringoplasties performed by registrars as determined by the Royal College of Surgeons of England National Comparative Audit survey, carried out in 1995 before the widespread implementation of recommended changes in otolaryngology registrar training, was set as the gold standard. In the period July 1998-1999 registrars had performed fewer myringoplasties than the standard, 17 per cent versus 34.2 per cent respectively (p = 0.035). A strategy to increase registrar exposure to myringoplasty surgery was then adopted by the department and the proportion of myringoplasties performed by registrars re-audited prospectively. The proportion of myringoplasties undertaken by registrars increased in the period January 2001 to July 2001 compared to July 1998-1999, 53 per cent versus 17 per cent respectively (p < 0.0007). Changes in working practice can address shortfalls in registrars' exposure to surgical procedures.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: It is generally said that taste function deteriorates naturally with age. Taste function after middle ear surgery in elderly patients has not been clarified., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The taste function of the chorda tympani nerve on the normal and diseased sides was examined before and after middle ear surgery using electrogustometry in 79 patients aged>60 years, and the findings were compared with those in 228 young and middle-aged patients., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The threshold of electrogustometry on the normal side increased significantly with increasing age (p<0.0001). The rate of thresholds that were off the scale was highest in the>70 years age group. The preoperative threshold on the diseased side increased significantly with increasing age in patients with chronic otitis media (p=0.0029) and cholesteatoma (p<0.0001). In patients with chronic otitis media, the postoperative threshold of the>60 years age group tended to be higher than that of the<60 years age group., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: These findings suggest that the taste function of the chorda tympani nerve deteriorated on the diseased side as much as on the normal side in elderly patients. Therefore, in most cases, we do not have to pay as much attention to the chorda tymapani nerve when performing surgery in elderly patients compared to young and middle-aged patients.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The objective of this study was to examine clinical and audiometric outcomes of a laser partial promontory technique in stapedotomy cases with a narrow oval window niche., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: We conducted a retrospective chart review., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: This study was conducted at a tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: We studied 59 patients who underwent a partial promontory technique with stapedotomy between 1994 and 2000. Seventy-two patients who underwent primary stapedotomy without promontory technique served as a control group., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Preoperative and postoperative audiometric results were obtained for 59 patients undergoing laser stapedotomy with a narrow oval window niche. The partial promontory removal was performed with a KTP laser. Results were compared with 72 primary laser stapedotomy cases without the promontory technique within the same time period and analyzed using paired Student t test., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Ninety percent of the partial promontory cases were successful (air-bone gap [ABG] <10 dB). The mean postoperative ABG was 5.1 dB, which was comparable to the non-promontory cases (p = 0.7). The mean change in postoperative bone conduction was also comparable (p = 0.98). There were no cases of sensorineural hearing loss. An overhanging facial nerve was present in 32% of the narrow niche cases and a dehiscent facial nerve was encountered in 17% of these cases., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Partial laser removal of the promontory as an adjunct to laser stapedotomy cases with a narrow oval window niche is a safe, effective technique with comparable results to primary laser stapedotomy.

N2  - Diving has become increasingly popular. With the growing number of patients who want to dive, there is an increasing number of divers who require their regular medical examination. As ENT problems are the most common disorders in divers, otorhinolaryngologists regularly have to assess the diver's fitness. It should be noted that an ENT examination does not certify complete fitness to dive! Diving can be resumed 3 months after middle ear surgery, especially after tympanoplastic type I, II and III with insertion of a PORP, when there is regular middle ear ventilation without atrophic scars of the tympanic membrane. Even after stapes surgery, diving can be resumed when there are no signs of vestibular irritation during a provocation test. By 3 months after sinus surgery, the diver should perform a test dive under supervision before fitness to dive can be certified. After inner ear barotrauma, the diver remains fit to dive depending on his hearing ability in the involved ear. After inner ear decompression illness, one should look for a vascular right-to-left shunt before diving can be resumed. These and many more aspects are discussed in this article on how to determine whether a diver with ENT problems is fit to dive.

N2  - A questionnaire survey was conducted in 324 patients with chronic, simple, suppurative otitis media who had undergone tympanoplasty 6 months or more previously to investigate post-operative hearing, tinnitus, vertigo, occlusive feeling of the ear and otorrhea. In addition, the overall satisfaction with tympanoplasty was assessed by VAS value. Subjective hearing improvement was observed in 73.1% of the patients whose hearing was poor and in 50% of those whose hearing was good before the operation. The degree of satisfaction assessed by VAS value corresponded with the subjective hearing assessment. As to tinnitus, 66.2% of the patients became aware of the disappearance or alleviation of symptoms. In the case of patients who had tinnitus before the operation, the degree of awareness of tinnitus and the degree of satisfaction assessed by VAS value coincided. However, no changes in the VAS value were observed in those who did not have tinnitus before the operation. As for vertigo, 30.5% of the patients who had vertigo preoperatively became aware of the disappearance of the symptoms after the operation. The degree of satisfaction assessed by VAS value corresponded with the presence or absence, severity and frequency of vertigo. As to the fullness of the ear, alleviation of the symptoms was subjectively noted by 85.9% of the patients who had symptoms before the operation. The degree of satisfaction assessed by VAS value corresponded with the severity of the symptoms in those who had symptoms before the operation. As for otorrhea, the disappearance of the symptoms was subjectively noted by 85.5% of the patients who had otorrhea before the operation. The degree of satisfaction assessed by VAS value corresponded with the post-operative changes in otorrhea. Based on the above results, it was assumed that the patients placed greatest expectation on hearing improvement when they underwent tympanoplasty. VAS is considered a useful method to evaluate the degree of satisfaction of patients after surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: The objective of this study was to present the technique of transfacial recess ossicular chain reconstruction (TFROCR) for potential use in selected patients with cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: The author conducted a retrospective case review of all candidates for TFROCR between August 1998 and March 2003., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: A tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: At first-stage tympanomastoidectomy, 22 ears (21 patients; 8 children and 13 adults) with cholesteatoma and ossicular discontinuity were identified as candidates for TFROCR. Seven patients had undergone previous tympanomastoid surgery., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: The first stage included canal wall up mastoidectomy with resection of disease, wide opening of the facial recess, cartilage graft tympanoplasty, and placement of silicone elastomer in the middle ear. Approximately 6 months later, patients underwent a second-stage postauricular procedure. Endoscopes were used to inspect the middle ear through the facial recess. When possible, TFROCR was then performed without elevating a tympanomeatal flap., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Variations in anatomy, disease control, and hearing results were studied., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Of the 22 candidate ears, 17 successfully underwent TFROCR, whereas 5 required traditional second-stage procedures with canal incisions. There were no surgical complications. Early hearing results are promising with an average air-bone gap of less than 20 dB. There have been no early failures from recurrent disease or prosthesis displacement., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: In carefully selected patients, TFROCR could be safe and effective for disease control and hearing restoration. It could provide for optimal prosthesis placement and almost immediate hearing improvement, avoiding the need for canal incisions, middle ear packing, and dry ear precautions. One must consider the potential risk of missing residual disease secondary to limited exposure.

N2  - We describe the case history of a 70-year-old female patient presenting with bilateral hearing disturbance, facial paralysis, and vertigo. Radiological tests of temporal bone revealed soft tissue in the mastoid and tympanic cavities, and T1 weighted MRI revealed prominent Gd enhancement of the middle skull basal meninges. Middle ear inflammation appeared to induce pachymeningitis and to exacerbate associated symptoms, leading to a decline in the patient's overall condition. Bilateral mastoidectomies were effective in improving her general condition. Her hearing improved only on the right side because ossiculoplasty was performed only on that side. Her facial movement progressively improved and pachymeningitis diminished over time. We speculate that removal of the infectious granulation within the middle ears and mastoids ameliorated the acute inflammation. The etiology remains unknown in this case.

N2  - This paper describes the Mills sleeve technique of ossicular reconstruction for defects of the incus long process and reviews the results of 27 procedures. A retrospective review of operations was performed by eight otologists. The results are compared with those from three other reconstruction techniques (cortical bone graft, cortical bone sleeve and incus autograft). Prostheses were supplied to surgeons who expressed an interest. Pre- and post-operative audiological data forms were analysed for each case along with a questionnaire about use of the prosthesis. The mean post-operative air bone gap (ABG) was compared with results from cortical bone sleeve, incus autograft and simple cortical bone graft reconstruction cases previously performed by the senior author. Twenty-seven procedures were performed. Closure of the ABG to within 10 dB was achieved for 44.4 per cent of Mills sleeve cases compared with 44.7 per cent for the cortical bone sleeve, 52.9 per cent for ossicular and 26.9 per cent for cortical bone grafts. The responses to a questionnaire sent to participating surgeons are discussed. For the current follow-up period (three months to three years) the Mills sleeve prosthesis appears to be safe and easy to use with audiological results at least as good as other reconstructive techniques.

N2  - The management of only hearing ears remains controversial because of the risk of postoperative hearing deterioration. We reviewed 12 cases of hearing ears alone operated on at the Hyogo College of Medicine Department of Otolaryngology from 1999 to 2002. All ears were dry at the final examination. Postoperative hearing results were evaluated based on the guideline of the Japan Otological Society (2000). An air bone gap within 15 dB was found in 9 cases (75%), hearing gain exceeding 15 dB was found in 6 cases (50%), the hearing level was within 30 dB in 4 cases (33.3%), and total successful cases numbered 10 (83.3%). Eight patients wore hearing aids before surgery, and 4 patients (50%) did not need them after the surgery. We suggest that tympanoplasty by skillful surgeons should be done to obtain a dry ear, to avoid a progressive hearing loss, to preserve or improve hearing, and to improve the quality of life. We also suggest that handling of ossicles should minimized in chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma.

N2  - Congenital absence of the stapes and the oval window is an anomaly reported in only sporadic cases. We present a 17-year-old male patient with congenital bilateral conductive hearing loss. The external auditory canal and the tympanic membrane appeared normal on both sides. An exploratory tympanotomy in the right ear revealed dehiscence of the the horizontal segment of the facial nerve, which was displaced inferiorly, occupying the area of the absent oval window. The stapes was totally absent and a malformed long process of the incus was attached by a fibrous band to the promontory. Manipulation of the facial nerve in association with stapedectomy or vestibulotomy was avoided in order not to injure the nerve. Instead, amplification with hearing aids was recommended to the patient.

Y1  - 2003//
N2  - The aim of the study was to analyze the incidence of anatomical variations and abnormalities of the facial nerve found during stapedectomy. Specific management in the case of an anomalous course of the facial nerve was also described. A retrospective analysis of clinical records of 316 stapedectomies was carried out in search for facial nerve anomalies. In 25 (7.9%) patients the facial nerve had an abnormal course. Twenty patients exhibited partial and two total overhang of the nerve over the oval window. In two of them the facial nerve was dehiscent in the tympanic segment and in three patients an obliterative type of the disease was also noted. The facial nerve dehiscence without the protrusion was found in two more patients. Another individual demonstrated otosclerotic bone over the facial nerve. In one case a duplicated facial nerve was found. Two branches of the nerve were almost covering the oval window (Fig. 1B). The piston was placed in the footplate between the branches of the duplicated nerve. The patient developed slight facial weakness (grade III in H-B scale) after the surgery. The function of the facial nerve returned to normal within 5 months. Anomalies of the course of the facial nerve can be found in about 8% of stapedectomies and they require specific management. The knowledge of the possible abnormalities and relevant procedures is crucial for safe and successful stapedectomy.

N2  - Since the publication of Miodonski, Zollner and Wullstein different methods and grafting materials have been promoted in tympanoplastic surgery. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the anatomical and functional results of tympanoplastic surgery with the use of cartilage and perichondrium grafts. The studies included a selected group of 112 patients who were operated on because of perforation of tympanic membrane. The analysed group consisted of 112 patients when perichondrium and cartilage were used to reconstruct the tympanic membrane. In all cases before and after operation there was made tonal audiometry with indication for air and bone conduction within range from 500 to 4000 Hz, verbal audiometry after operation with indication of speech detection and speech reception threshold using mono-syllable NLA-93 test, tympanometry after operation and evaluation of anatomical results after surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: The diagnosis of perilymphatic fistula (PLF) is difficult since no single clinical situation gives the diagnosis for sure. The goal of this study is to clarify the clinical situations where you must suspect a PLF., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Retrospective study of 20 patients that had an exploratory tympanotomy with a PLF confirmed peroperatively. An analysis of the symptoms, signs and complementary exams was done. The surgical findings and the postoperative evolution were noted., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: 100% of patients reported a hearing loss, 80% vertigo, 70% a tinnitus and 35% equilibrium problems. Every patient had an etiological event to explain the PLF (trauma 85%), stapedotomy (10%), other ear surgeries. Five patients had a positive fistula or Vasalva test. All patients except one had an hearing loss on the audiogram (sensorineural, mixte or conductive). 50% had a CT scan, 70% of which were abnormal. A VNG was done on 3 patients. The sites of the PLF were as follows: 90% oval window, 5% round window and 5% both windows. The hearing got better or was stabilised in 95% of patients after the operation. 64% saw an improvement of their tinnitus and 87% of their vertigo., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The diagnosis of PLF is difficult and a high index of suspicion is mandatory. One must look for an etiologic situation to explain the PLF. The audiogram is almost always modified, a mixte hearing loss being common due to the high incidence of ossicular trauma associated with PLF. The clinical clinical situations where you must suspect a PLF were identified as follows: An old trauma, a recent trauma, a history of otologic surgery particularly on the stapes and a preexisting hearing loss that aggravates. A diagnosis scale to evaluate the risk of PLF, based on clinical situations, physical exam and complementary exams was done to help the clinician in the evaluation of PLF.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate how much patients remember of the risks discussed with them about their otologic surgery and to evaluate whether a simple intervention, the addition of an information handout, improves recall., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A prospective, randomized trial was undertaken in the setting of an academic tertiary care centre., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Fifty patients undergoing a variety of otologic procedures, including mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, ossiculoplasty, and stapedectomy, were verbally consented by the operating surgeon with a standard checklist of potential surgical complications and side effects. Two surgeons participated in the study (40 patients and 10 patients). Patients were stratified into two groups: a higher education group and a lower education group. Within each group, patients were randomized to either a control group, consisting of a verbal explanation only, or an intervention group, which added a written handout to the verbal explanation. A follow-up telephone interview was conducted at an average of 20.6 days (range 14-53) to survey for recall of the complications discussed., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: The main outcome measure is risk recall. This is analyzed by education level and written sheet intervention. Other parameters examined are patient demographics, time elapsed from when the consent was obtained, and surgeon obtaining the consent., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: All 50 patients were interviewed in follow-up. Twenty-two patients received the handout (intervention arm), and 28 patients served as the control group. Overall recall, expressed as a percentage of risks explained, was 54% for the entire study group. For those who received the handout, the recall rate was 51%, whereas the rate was actually higher, at 56%, for those who did not receive the handout. This difference was not statistically significant. Of the specific risks discussed, patient recall was consistently high for the complications of facial nerve paralysis, 88%, and for complete hearing loss, at 88%. Other risks, such as dizziness, 31%, and change in taste, 36%, were not as commonly recalled. Receiving the handout made only a significant difference with one complication, facial nerve paralysis., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The addition of a handout did not significantly alter recall of potential complications of otologic surgery with the exception of facial nerve paralysis.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Surgical trauma leads to systemic changes in haemostasis. Haematological changes activated by surgery may become so prominent that changes caused by anaesthesia might be hidden or underestimated. Therefore, we have undertaken a prospective study to compare the behaviour of selected factors involved in the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Forty healthy adult patients scheduled for otological surgery were enrolled in the study. Upon receiving informed consent, they were randomly assigned to receive either inhalational (IA) or total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA). Platelet function (PFA100TM), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) panel, and generalized d-dimer (GFC) were studied during certain periods of anaesthesia to identify the changes in haemostasis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Statistically, no significant change in DIC parameters were encountered between the two groups. No statistical difference was found between the two groups in the measured coagulation parameters, but statistically GFC showed slight activation in the 1st hour of surgical intervention., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Presuming a minimal traumatic effect of surgical procedure on the determined variables, we conclude that different anaesthetic techniques have a negligible effect on platelet activation and fibrinolysis. The clinical relevance of coagulation activation and fibrinolysis during different anaesthetic techniques remains to be investigated.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: Because it is necessary to maintain controlled hypotension during middle ear surgery in order to avoid bleeding and as it is known that cochlear blood flow (CBF) is related to blood pressure (BP), it is useful to evaluate CBF modifications induced by anaesthetics in order to prevent cochlear damage. The aim of this paper is to evaluate, using laser Doppler flowmetry, which anaesthetic drug, out of sevoflurane and propofol, has the smallest effect on CBF., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Twenty consenting adult patients scheduled for myringoplasty under general anaesthesia for simple tympanic membrane perforation were studied. Patients were divided into two groups: the first group was treated with sevoflurane and the second with propofol. For the first group, CBF measurement was carried out on three different occasions: (i) at a basal low drug dosage; (ii) having increased the drug dosage to a higher level; and (iii) having reduced the drug dosage to the basal low level again. For the second group, CBF measurement was carried out on three different occasions: (i) 10 min after injecting a bolus of propofol; (ii) immediately after a second propofol injection; and (iii) 10 min after a third injection of propofol. A probe was placed over the promontory in order to measure CBF levels., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In the subjects treated with sevoflurane, after having increased the drug dosage, BP decreased significantly while CBF did not change significantly. In the subjects treated with propofol we recorded a significant reduction in BP, as well as a decrease in CBF., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The results obtained show that sevoflurane has a hypotensive effect without modifying CBF, while propofol, although having a similar effect on BP to sevoflurane, has less of a protective effect on inner ear microcirculation.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to evaluate the causes, the diagnosis, the treatment and the results obtained by revision surgery, in cases of stapedectomy failures., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Retrospective study of 50 recent cases operated on between January 1997 and December 2001. DIAGNOSIS OF THE FAILURE: All reoperated patients had clinical and audiological assessment; CT scan with virtual endoscopy., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The mean time of onset of failure was 23 months. The mean preoperative air bone gap was 25.5 dB. Otoscopy revealed a retraction pocket caused by poor eustachian tube function in 9 cases. CT scan proved to be very effective at differentiating the cause of the failure., <ovid:b>OPERATIVE FINDINGS</ovid:b>: In 11 cases the prosthesis was too short, in 8 cases the prosthesis had migrated out of the hole of stapedotomy and in 6 cases the piston was fixed in the stapedotomy hole. A partial or complete lysis of the long process of the incus was frequently associated, but in 9 cases it was the only cause of the failure. In all the cases when the piston was displaced, the stapedotomy was found to be covered by a thin mucous membrane, avoiding labyrinthine fistula. In 3 cases, the failure was due to recurrent otosclerosis. In 5 cases the failure was due to a local anomaly at the level of the oval window niche, 2 cases of failure were due to a malleus ankylosis. In 5 cases fibrous adhesion was found between the incus and the mucosa of the promontory. In one case a reparative granuloma was found at the level of the oval window., <ovid:b>TREATMENT</ovid:b>: In cases of partial lysis of the long process of the incus, a new prosthesis was placed in a 0.4 mm diameter stapedotomy, performed using a KTP laser. A 0.4 mm diameter piston was extended 0.2 mm below stapedotomy to avoid a new extrusion. Indeed some prosthesis extrusion could be due to increased movements of the ossicular chain in cases of eustachian tube dysfunction. In cases of complete lysis of the long process of the incus, or in cases of a very short long process of the incus, a piston was put in the stapedotomy and attached to the malleus manubrium. The results of revision stapedotomy were favorable in the absence of associated fibrous tissue adhesion or local malformation. The air bone gap was found to be less than 10 dB in 40 cases and between 10 and 20 dB in 8 cases. An impairment of the air bone gap was found in 2 cases. No case of bone conduction impairment was found in this series.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The incidence and the scale of recovery of the taste function after middle ear surgery is usually determined by the use of anamnestic data and electrogustometry., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Taste tests (regional chemical taste test, electrogustometry and subjective evaluation) were performed preoperatively, 2 to 3 weeks and 6 to 9 months after middle ear surgery. These results were evaluated by taking the scale of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) manipulation into consideration. Three groups were chosen: group 1: no or small CTN manipulation, n = 54; group 2: strong CTN manipulation, n = 14; group 3: severed CTN, n = 50., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: In a prospective study 118 patients were examined after middle ear surgery in the ENT-Department of the University of Rostock between 2001 and 2002. 61 females and 57 males, age from 7 - 81 years, were included., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Complaints were observed in all three groups, mainly in groups 2 and 3. These included taste disorders, taste phenomenon and numbness of the tongue. Using regional chemical taste tests, the taste loss of group 3 could be proven for those patients with complaints in 64 % and for those patients without complaints in 27 %. The electrogustometry is more sensitive than chemical taste test. All patients had pathological thresholds after chorda cutting (78 % no thresholds; 22 % elevated thresholds). 68 out of 118 patients (58 %) had a second follow-up after 6 to 9 months after middle ear surgery. The complaints are declining in all groups. In groups 2 and 3 a recovery of taste function could be observed. Even if the number of patients with severed chorda, who suffer from taste disorders, diminishes, a recovery of the taste function could only be observed in 30 %., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The scale of chorda manipulation is important for the recovery of the taste function after middle ear surgery. The CTN should be preserved intraoperatively, especially when an operation of the contralateral ear is planned as well.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Among other materials it is also possible to use autologous fat tissue for closing tympanic membrane perforations. In this study we have evaluated 44 consecutive myringoplasties with adipose tissue performed between 1999 and 2001., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHOD</ovid:b>: The indications were residual microperforations following tympanoplasty with temporalis fascia or tympanic membrane perforations due to trauma or chronic otitis media simplex. Myringoplasty with fat tissue was performed as an outpatient procedure and took about 15 minutes. The adipose tissue was harvested from the posterior side of the ear lobe in local anaesthesia. After refreshing the borders of the tympanic membrane perforation with a micro hook, the adipose tissue was positioned into the perforation by using a handheld or fixed ear speculum. The graft was covered with a silk strip soaked with Garamycine ointment. In bigger perforations a bed of gelfoam was put into the tympanic cavity in order to avoid adhesions between the graft and the promontorium., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A permanent healing of the tympanic membrane was achieved in 40 (91 %) out of the 44 patients. In 21 patients hearing improved between 5 -10 dB. Surgical complications did not occur., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Our results indicate that transcanal myringoplasty with adipose tissue is a simple and minimally invasive method for closing small to medium sized tympanic membrane perforations.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of stapes surgery after 20 years of follow-up and to compare the results between large fenestra versus small fenestra stapedotomy., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective clinical study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center (university hospital)., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: One hundred forty-two patients with otosclerosis treated by surgery., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Eighty patients had a total stapedectomy with House-wire prosthesis and 62 patients a stapedotomy with Teflon-piston prosthesis., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Preoperative, postoperative, and long-term hearing thresholds were compared. Patients filled in a questionnaire about the impact of surgery on the quality of life and postoperative symptoms., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The long-term pure tone average improvement did not differ significantly between the techniques compared with the preoperative values. The air-bone gap tended to enlarge as a function of time. The change in the pure tone average was 0.9 dB per year for both techniques. In the questionnaire, some patients reported vertigo, tinnitus, loud noise intolerance, and taste disturbances. Loud noise intolerance seemed to persist in the long term. Surgery had no effect on preoperative tinnitus., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: There were no statistically significant differences between the techniques regarding hearing results. Over the long term, both techniques are safe and effective in restoring hearing and improving quality of life.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To evaluate the results of partial and total ossicular reconstruction prostheses entirely made of hydroxylapatite., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: A retrospective review of cases followed-up between 1997 and 2000., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: One hundred adult patients (60 men and 40 women) were studied. The mean age was 55 years (range, 25 to 65 years). Fifty patients had a previous tympanoplasty. The series included 45 cholesteatomas (45%), 37 chronic otitis media without cholesteatoma (37%), 13 retraction pockets (13%), and 5 posttraumatic ossicular displacements (5%)., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: A one-stage ossiculoplasty with a partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (n = 65) or a total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (n = 35) was performed. This was associated with a simple mastoidectomy in 70 cases and a radical mastoidectomy in 10 cases., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: All patients were followed-up at 1 year, and 50 were reexamined 2 years after surgery. Clinical and audiometric data were collected in a database at each visit., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: A prosthetic extrusion was noted in two cases (2%). A prosthetic displacement occurred in 10 cases (10%). A revision surgery was carried out in 10 cases because of an ossiculoplasty failure or a disease recurrence. At 1 year, the residual air-bone gap was lower in cases with a partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis than those with a total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (16 +/- 9.3 versus 23 +/- 13.7 dB, p < 0.05). The gain in mean air conduction threshold was 21 +/- 12.8 dB in cases of partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis and 19 +/- 11.3 dB in cases of total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis (not significant). Revision surgery, canal wall-down mastoidectomy, or cholesteatoma yielded poorer functional results., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Partial ossicular reconstruction prosthesis and total ossicular reconstruction prosthesis entirely made of dense hydroxylapatite yielded high rates of air-bone gap reduction and high anatomic stability.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION</ovid:b>: Management of chronic perforation and severe posterior and/or attic Retraction Pocket (RP) or atelectasis of the tympanic membrane continues to be one of the most difficult problems for otologists., <ovid:b>AIM OF THE STUDY</ovid:b>: To analyse the usefulness of the tympanic membrane reconstruction with tragal cartilage., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: The study included 27 patients with chronic perforation or severe RP operated by the same surgeon, using tragal cartilage tympanoplasty. Seven supplementary procedures were required for recurrent cholesteatoma (second-look surgery)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There has been no recurrence of the retraction and the perforation. Nineteen ossicular reconstructions were necessary with acceptable hearing results., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Tragal cartilage has made a significant improvement in the tympanic membrane reconstruction procedure. A large thin cartilage combined with a titanium prosthesis can provide an excellent anatomical result, perfect stability and good functional outcome. When the eardrum is intact, we still use allografts of costal cartilage for the management of the retraction pocket or titanium prosthesis.

N2  - Otorhinolaryngologists throughout the UK routinely perform middle ear operations. Although the risk of serious complications in the hands of a well-trained surgeon is very low, some of the complications of middle ear surgery are devastating to the patient viz. facial nerve palsy and complete hearing loss. The subject of informed consent is highly topical because of clinical governance and medico-legal implications. We have audited the practice of the Consultant members of the British Association of Otorhinolaryngologists-Head and Neck Surgeons via a postal questionnaire with regards to their consenting process prior to middle ear operations. Our study looked at the practice of discussing different complications and the complication rates, the person consenting, time spent on consenting, and the documentation. We found that wide variations exist in the consenting process. The implications of the results are discussed. This study is particularly pertinent at the present time with the implementation of the new consenting standards document published by the Department of Health.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To review the outcome in consecutive patients who have undergone complete epitympanic and mastoid obliteration and concurrent tympanic membrane reconstruction over a 53-month period., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective review., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Tertiary referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Sixty-two ears in 56 sequential patients undergoing mastoid obliteration with major indications including recurrent infection, debris trapping in the canal wall-down cavity, intolerance of water exposure, calorically induced vertigo in an existing cavity, a semicircular canal fistula, and inability to wear a hearing device. Thirty-six ears in 33 patients who underwent second-stage surgery for ossicular reconstruction during the same time period are also reviewed., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Transplanted autogenous cranial bone is used to induce osteoneogenesis resulting in complete obliteration of the epitympanic and mastoid spaces while maintaining a mesotympanic space., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Success of obliteration, incidence of symptoms prompting intervention, hearing outcome, incidence of recurrent cholesteatoma, and incidence of eustachian tube dysfunction necessitating treatment and need for revision surgical procedures. RESULTS Complete take of the bony obliteration occurs in over 95% of cases; 90% of treated patients enjoy complete absence of original symptoms, whereas symptoms improved in the remainder. For over 95% of patients, existing eustachian tube function has been adequate after obliteration. To date, no patient has required revision surgical intervention., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Mastoid obliteration with autogenous cranial bone is a safe and extremely effective option for treatment of problematic canal wall-down mastoid cavities. Surgical techniques that include sterile harvest of the cranial bone graft mixed with antibiotic, revision of the cavity to expose viable native bone, inclusion of the epitympanic spaces in the obliteration, and complete coverage of the pAte with autogenous fascia have proven critical to successful outcome.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Although the temporalis fascia has been widely used since 1957as a graft in tympanoplasty, it can eventually become thin and atrophic. In addition, due to the lack of elasticity and resistance to pressure changes in the external ear canal, secondary perforations may also develop. Therefore, several authors have suggested that temporalis fascia should be strengthened by periosteum or replaced by cartilage., <ovid:b>MATERIAL/METHODS</ovid:b>: In the present paper the term chondrotympanoplasty is introduced to describe modified techniques of cartilage graft tympanoplasty and intratympanal chondroplasties. These techniques were used in 76 patients who were prospectively followed up for two years post-operatively., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In type I chondrotympanoplasty, the mean pre-operative air-bone gap was reduced from 20 dB to 8 dB at 2000 Hz. In 93% of these cases the cartilage graft was taken without problems and there was no perforation in the new eardrum. In two cases of type I chondrotympanoplasty who experienced acute post-operative otitis media, the cartilage graft was found to be relatively resistant to infection, as only a pinhole perforation was noted. Type III chondrotympanoplasty with endotympanic chondroplasty (intratympanal tubal chondroplasty and intratympanal stapes chondroplasty) was found to give good aeration in the cavity, an intact new eardrum, and remarkable hearing results, reducing the mean pre-operative air-bone gap from 25 dB to 10 dB at 2000 Hz., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Cartilage was found to be an excellent graft material and the described chondrotympanoplasties gave very promising results. Cartilage should be used more widely in tympanoplasty (chondrotympanoplasty).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and characteristics of tinnitus in otosclerosis and to evaluate the effects of stapes surgery on the course of this symptom., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Hospital ear, nose, and throat department., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND DESIGN</ovid:b>: Sixty-two patients (65 ears) scheduled to undergo stapes surgery were prospectively enrolled in the study. The incidence and characteristics of tinnitus were recorded using a specific questionnaire before surgery and 1 and 6 months after surgery. The frequency range of the tinnitus was noted during standard audiometric examination. Audiometric data were recorded following AAO-HNS guidelines., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: All patients underwent stapes surgery (either stapedectomy or stapedotomy)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Tinnitus was present at the time of surgery in 74% of the patients. It was severely disabling for patients in 24.6% of the cases. In patients who were preoperatively free of tinnitus, no tinnitus was noted in the postoperative period (1 and 6 months). In patients with preoperative tinnitus, tinnitus ceased in 55.9%, decreased in 32.4%, remained the same in 8.8%, and increased in 2.9% 6 months after surgery. Statistical analysis did not reveal any significant prognostic factors regarding the course of tinnitus., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: In otosclerotic patients who will undergo stapedectomy to improve hearing, stapes surgery may also improve tinnitus in most of them.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To review short- and longer-term results of type III tympanoplasties as performed by the senior author and to compare these results with those reported in the literature., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: Retrospective review of 96 type III tympanoplasties, with and without mastoidectomy, performed between April 1996 and August 2000., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: At a mean of 384 days postoperatively, 57.3% of patients had an air-bone gap of less than 20 dB. The average postoperative gap is 21.4 dB. Gap closure is best at 2000 Hz, with an average drop of 51% from initial value, compared with 34%, 39%, and 18% at 500, 1000, and 4000 Hz, respectively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Our results are similar to those published previously. We emphasize the improvement at 2000 Hz, which is an important frequency for speech discrimination. It would be interesting to see if it correlates with an improvement in quality of life.

N2  - The last 30 years have seen a gradual change in the management of otosclerosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the current practice amongst Irish otolaryngology consultants by a questionnaire and to compare it with the practice currently followed in Great Britain. Thirty-eight responses (67.9%) were available for analysis. The overall trend is towards centralisation with a reduction in the number of surgeons undertaking stapes surgery (39%). The majority of consultants (67%) who undertake stapes surgery would operate for a unilateral conductive loss and 67% would undertake bilateral stapes surgery. Stapedotomy is the only operation performed (100%) with none of the consultants performing partial or total stapedectomies.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To evaluate the clinical features of labyrinthine fistulae occurring as a late complication of middle ear surgery using the canal wall down technique., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: This was a retrospective study of the past 23 years, conducted at a single tertiary care center. The authors evaluated the backgrounds, clinical features, and surgical findings in 25 patients with labyrinthine fistulae, who had a history of ear surgery using the canal down technique and who underwent a second operation at their hospital., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: All the patients underwent revision surgery because of persistent or recurrent vertigo caused by labyrinthine fistulae, circumscribed labyrinthitis, or suppurative labyrinthitis., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: The clinical features of this disease entity were assessed by history, surgical findings, and the results of audiovestibular testing., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The patients had a long history of repetitive postoperative aural discharge before experiencing vertigo, which initially occurred 4 to 64 years (average, 20.2 years) after the previous operation. At the first visit to the authors' clinic, the results of a fistula test conducted with a Politzer's bulb were positive in 14 patients and negative in 5 patients. In the remaining 6 ears, pressure loading of the ear canal induced the sensation of vertigo without accompanying nystagmus. Surgical intervention showed that the fistulae were located at the lateral semicircular canal in 19 ears, at the footplate of the stapes in 4 ears, and at the promontory in 2 ears. Labyrinthine fistulae were closed with conchal cartilage, bone paste (bone dust mixed with fibrin glue), and/or temporalis fascia. In some patients, the fistulae were further covered with pedicled temporalis muscle. In 2 cases complicated by acute suppurative labyrinthitis, the mastoid cavity was obliterated after completion of the labyrinthectomy. The postoperative courses in all patients were uneventful., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: A labyrinthine fistula may be created by repeated and insidious infection of a mastoid cavity that has been exposed to the outside during canal wall down surgery. Intensive care of the opened mastoid cavity is essential to avoid this late complication.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To analyze outcome after otosclerosis surgery with stamedeotomy with blood clot sealing., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: Otosclerosis surgery was performed in 150 adult patients between 1997 and 1999 by five surgical teams (70% of the procedures were performed by senior surgeons) and followed for 18 months. Stapedotomy was carried out under general anesthesia with an intrameatal approach in 96% of the cases. Stapedotomy (n=120, 80%) was performed with a drill in 141 cases and by laser in 9 (6%). Ninety percent of the Teflon prostheses had a 0.4 mm diameter and a 4.5 mm length. The footplate opening was sealed with blood clots. Venous interposition (n=30, 20%) was performed in the event of partial or total stapedectomy which occurred in spite of an initial stapedotomy attempt., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The preoperative air-bone gap (ABG) was 32 +/- 10.3 dB. The gain in air conduction was 25 +/- 11.7 dB with 75% of the patients having more than 15 dB gain. The ABG was 10 +/- 5.4 dB with 73% of the patients having less than 5 dB gain. The interaural difference was 0.5 +/- 14.1 dB and the bone conduction (BC) variation was 1 +/- 7.5 dB. Functional failures were related to significant intralabyrinthine bleeding and revision procedure. The following factors had not effect on outcome: i) stapedotomy versus partial or total stapedectomy, footplate opening sealed by clots or vein, ii) diameter of the stapedotomy and/or the prosthesis, iii) surgical procedure performed by a junior surgeon., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Sealing the stapedotomy opening with blood clots appears to provide reliable and reproducible functional outcome that remains stable over time. In this study, changing from partial to total stapedectomy with vein interposition did not modify the functional outcome.

N2  - Repeated exposure to a topical aminoglycoside in patients with ear discharge can induce a delayed hypersensitivity reaction eventually. A postal survey conducted by the authors showed that 75% of UK otolaryngologists routinely prescribe topical aminoglycosides to their patients following ear surgery. This is a prospective study on the result of skin patch testing on 119 patients with chronic otitis media and 30 patients with otosclerosis who were scheduled for otosurgery. Any history of previous exposure to antibiotic eardrops for each patient was recorded. Overall, 14.1% of the patients had a positive skin reaction to one of the aminoglycosides (13.4% for Gentamicin; 12.8% for Neomycin and 4.5% for Framycetin). Sixteen per cent (16%) of the patients with chronic otitis media and 6.7% of the patients with otosclerosis were allergic to one of the aminoglycosides commonly found in antibiotic eardrops. Patients who received more than five courses of antibiotics eardrops previously had a greater tendency of developing allergy to the aminoglycosides (35.3%).

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: An efficient training program in ear surgery needs suitable models to learn the specific preparation techniques. However, conventionally fixed or fresh frozen ears of human corpses do not meet all demands. Therefore we investigated the feasibility of ears fixed according to Thiel for surgical training in the temporal bone lab., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Various surgical techniques on external and middle ears were evaluated on ears from cadavers fixed according to Thiel. Structure and consistency of the tissues were compared to vital conditions by means of a standardized questionnaire., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Structure and consistency of the tissues of the auditory canal, the tympanic cavity and the mastoid were comparable to vital conditions. Merely the cartilage of the auricle was considerable softened. This enabled a surgical preparation under conditions close to the intravital situation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Under the aspects of quality assurance and efficiency of continuous medical education in middle ear surgery, the Thiel fixation technique provides an excellent prerequisite.

N2  - The aim of this study was to examine the anatomical landmarks of the retrotympanum using two different techniques, virtual endoscopy (VE) and fiberoptic endoscopy, and to correlate the results furnished by the two methods. Ten otosclerotic patients who were due to undergo stapedectomy were scanned using high-resolution spiral CT. Selected CT datasets were processed with Navigator 2.0 software to obtain virtual endoscopic views of the retrotympanum. Subsequently, during the surgical procedure, fiberoptic endoscopy was performed with 2.7-mm 0 degrees and 30 degrees rigid endoscopes. The ability of the two imaging methods to identify specific anatomical structures was then compared. In all cases the pyramidal eminence, pyramidal crest and sinus tympani were clearly identified in both VE images and otoendoscopy recordings, while fiberoptic endoscopy seemed to be less satisfactory than VE for studying the facial sinus, sinus of Proctor and fossula of Grivot. The two techniques proved to be equally sensitive for visualizing the ponticulus and subiculum, while the stapedius tendon could be visualized only by means of fiberoptic endoscopy. Overall, VE imaging appears promising for rendering important anatomical details of the retrotympanum, allowing identification of osseous landmarks and exploring recesses that are difficult to visualize via otoendoscopy.

Only patients who required promontory drilling and who had complete preoperative and postoperative audiometric testing including bone conduction were included. Promontory drilling was performed with a skeeter drill to thin the promontory. Twenty-five stapedectomy patients who did not undergo promontory drilling were randomly selected from this same period as a comparison group., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In addition to the narrow oval window niche, associated anatomical findings were facial nerve overhang in five patients and an obliterated footplate in three patients. Ninety-six percent of cases were successful (<10 dB postoperative air-bone gap). The one unsuccessful case was a strut over the mobile footplate that was later successfully revised. No patients suffered from intraoperative or postoperative tinnitus or vertigo. The mean 4-frequency (500-4,000 Hz) pure-tone average revealed slight improvement in bone conduction postoperatively., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Drilling of the promontory in stapedectomy is required in only a small percentage of cases. Although audiometric results indicated the possibility of a slight amount of acoustic trauma from the drilling, the effect on hearing was minimal and not considered a contraindication to this procedure.

N2  - The intraoperative effect of the Argon and KTP laser was studied on 20 patients who had primary stapes surgery under local anaesthetic; 10 had Argon and 10 had KTP laser stapedotomy. Symptoms of inner ear disturbance such as dizziness and tinnitus were systematically recorded during the laser procedure. Both dizziness and tinnitus were relatively uncommon when the laser was used on the promontory. When the laser was used to transect the posterior crus, all the patients reported transient dizziness, probably from the thermal effect through the posterior crus into the inner ear. However, tinnitus was unusual during this stage. When the laser was used to fenestrate the footplate, only 30% of patients reported a transient dizziness as less laser energy was used. On the other hand, 55% of the patients experienced tinnitus during this stage, which indicates an acoustic effect on the inner ear. There is no difference between the Argon and KTP laser.

N2  - The last 30 years has seen a gradual change in the management of otosclerosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the current practice among British otolaryngology consultants using a questionnaire, and to compare it with the practice reported in a survey 8 years ago. A total of 353 valid responses (64.5%) were available for analysis. The overall trend is towards centralization, with a reduction in the number of surgeons undertaking stapes surgery (49.9%). The majority of consultants (81.3%) who undertake stapes surgery would operate for a unilateral conductive loss and 75.1% would undertake bilateral stapes surgery. Stapedotomy is the operation of choice (82%), with a few consultants performing partial or rarely total stapedectomies. Postoperative restrictions and follow-up times vary widely amongst surgeons, with the senior surgeons tending to be more conservative than the younger consultants.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Injuries of the ossicular chain have various etiologies. Skull traumas from blows to the temporal, parietal or occipital region with or without fracture of the temporal bone are the main causes of the ossicular injury; other modes of injury are rare. It depends on the type of trauma which kind of injury occurs. Mainly subluxations, luxations and fractures are to be observed. The incus is the ossicle which is the most often injured. Mostly, only one ossicle is injured, rarely two or all of them., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: From January 1997 to June 1999 we operated 19 patients with traumatic lesions of the membrane and the middle ear. In 4 cases the reason for the operation was an injury of the stapes. We observed 2 cases with broken stapes crura, 1 case with an impression of the stapes into the vestibulum with perilymphatic fistula and 1 case with subluxation of the stapes in the direction of the promontorium. By presenting 4 cases we want to point out the diagnostic possibilities and the operative management of such rare injuries. In all cases we applied the transmeatal approach for the operation of the middle ear. In 2 cases it was possible to place the stapes back in their anatomic position in order to re-establish the ossicular chain. In the other 2 cases we had to use middle ear prostheses which were interpositioned between the manubrium of the malleus and the footplate of the stapes., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In all cases the immediate post-operative hearing results and the long-term hearing results after 10 to 28 months were satisfying. We did not notice any post-operative complications, especially no vestibular symptoms. One patient's tinnitus was the same as before the operation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The diagnosis of a stapes injury is despite the use of sophisticated technology, especially the CT-scan of the temporal bone, often very difficult. A sensitive anamnesis seems to be very important. It depends on the kind of injury which operative technique is to be applied in order to re-establish the ossicular chain. In our opinion, it is useful to take - if it is possible - the autolog stapes for the surgical re-establishment of transmission.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The choice of the graft in ossicular chain reconstruction during middle ear surgery for cholesteatoma is a subject still discussed on. In order to clarify the discussion of reuse of the autologous ossicles obtained during middle ear surgery for cholesteatoma, we evaluated the probability of residual disease histologically and the safety of the ossicles after autoclavization, the most promoting alternative method to eradicate residual cholesteatoma and infection on them., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The specimens used in this study were eroded twenty-seven ossicles (22 incuses, 5 malleoli) which were removed from the 27 consecutive patients operated because of cholesteatomatous middle ear disease. They were grouped as follows: Group 1, Fifteen ossicles examined histopathologically directly. Group 2, Five ossicles autoclaved for 20 min at 134 degrees C and then examined histopathologically. Group 3, Five ossicles autoclaved for 20 min at 134 degrees C after mechanical surface cleaning by a fine diamond drill, examined histopathologically. Group 4, Two ossicles removed from two different patients were placed in their mastoid cavities in order to be examined after access in the second-look operation. While one ossicle was only autoclaved, the other was mechanically cleaned by a drill before autoclavization (for 20 min at 134 degrees C). The ossicles were examined histopathologically after the removal at the second stage operation performed 12 months later., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: In Group 1, all ossicles showed evidence of periosteal thickening. Additional findings were surface cholesteatoma or epithelia in 13 ossicles, surface inflammation in 12 ossicles, granulation tissue in 10 ossicles, osteitis in six ossicles. In Group 2, all five ossicles had preserved their lamellar structure but, no vital cells were seen. The lacunes that had the osteocytes was almost completely empty. The inflammatory cells were eliminated from the ossicles. In Group 3, ossicles were found well preserved with their lamellar structures and contours, with empty lacunes and eliminated inflammatory cells. In Group 4, in two ossicles of this group the lacunes were replaced by the new migrated viable osteocytes with evidence of new bone formation and neovascularisation. No new inflammatory focus or epithelia were found on the surfaces of the ossicles. The shape and the contour of the ossicles remained unchanged., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: In cholesteatoma surgery, ossicles with minimal erosion and adequate thickness can be used after autoclavization. In this study, it was observed histopathologically that the autoclaving autologous ossicles before ossiculoplasty in cholesteatomatous middle ear is a safe and reliable method.

Y1  - 2001//
N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The role mastoid cavity plombage played in restoring physiological function of external meatus in open method tympanoplasty was studied., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: 85 cases of cholesteatoma otitis media were performed open method tympanoplasty with the broken bits of their own mastoid process cortex, homological costal cartilage or U shape periosteum connective tissue valve. And plombage was performed at the same time. The reconstruction of ossicular chain (type 0 tympanoplasty): 10 ears did not undergo reconstruction due to increase ment of bone conduction threshold or were in preparation for the second phase operation; 40 ears underwent type III tympanoplasty; 35 ears underwent type IV tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>RESULT</ovid:b>: The total improvement rate of hearing was 76%, among which 80% were performed type III tympanoplasty and 71.4% underwent type IV tympanoplasty. After operation, the time waited till dry-ears was 19.8 +/- 65.31 days and the dry-ears rate was 97.6% (83/85). Six months after operation, 89.4% (76/85) had smooth external meatus and fine self-cleaning function and no recurrence was found., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: As to cholesteatoma otitis media that could not be performed closed method tympanoplasty, U shape periosteum connective tissue valve and mastoid process cortex were used. Mastoid cavity plombage with homological costal cartilage could effectively overcome the shortcomings of destruction of physiological structure of external meatus caused by open method tympanoplasty, the self-cleaning function of skins of external meatus was remained and the life quality of patients after operation was increased.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To promote the hearing, improve the appearance, shorten the therapeutic course in congenital malformation of external and middle ear, the program of primary restoration has been designed., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: Under general or local anaesthesia a Z-shaped incision is made in skin. After turn up the flap A (defective ear) and flap B(retroauricular skin), a periosteal flap C with pedicle in front is made and elevated from mastoid. Then made frameworklize on mastoid and perform tympanoplasty. Once the myringograft is put properly the flap C is turn into the mastoidal cavity to serve as the lining of anterior wall. Flap A is sutured with the edge of retroauricular incision to serve as the lower part of new auricle. Then use the flap B to wrap a siliceous frame to make the upper part of new auricle. Finally, the naked walls of mastoidal cavity are lined with free skin graft and the cavity is packed with vaseline gauze for two weeks., <ovid:b>RESULT</ovid:b>: Two cases of congenital malformation of external and middle ear were treated with the procedure mentioned above and were followed up for one and 3 years respectively. Both effects of shape and hearing were good., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The primary restoration for congenital malformation of external and middle ear designed by the authors is an excellent method worthy to be recommended.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To examine the relationship between doctor-parent communication patterns and parents' perceptions that they were listened to by the doctor., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Cross-sectional, clinic-based survey. Before the visit, parents were asked about the strength of their desires/preferences for being listened to; after the visit, they were asked if their desires were fulfilled and to rate their satisfaction with care. Encounters were audiotaped, transcribed, and coded for parent requests for information and action and physician responses to those requests. Coding was performed using an adapted version of the Taxonomy of Requests by Patients (TORP). Physician responses to parental requests for information were coded as brief, moderate, or prolonged fulfillment or as partially fulfilled, ignored, or denied., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Two private pediatric practices, 1 community based and 1 university based., <ovid:b>PARTICIPANTS</ovid:b>: Ten of 13 eligible physicians (participation rate, 77%) and 306 of 356 eligible parents (participation rate, 86%) who sought care for their children's respiratory illnesses. Parents were invited to participate if they spoke and read English and if their child was 2-10 years old, had a chief complaint of cold symptoms, and was seeing one of the participating physicians. Complete data were obtained for 287 doctor-parent encounters (94%)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Before the visit, 74% of parents reported that they considered it necessary for the physician to listen to their ideas about their child's illness. Among these parents, 62% (n = 130) reported after the visit that the physician had listened to their ideas. As the proportion of moderate-length responses to parent requests for information increased, parents were significantly more likely to report being listened to (P <.05). Multivariate results indicated a 59% probability of parents reporting that they were listened to when given moderate-length responses, 45% when given brief responses, 39% when given prolonged responses, and 12% when requests for information were only partially fulfilled, ignored, or denied. The length of response to parent requests for information was not related to overall parent satisfaction., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Parents who received moderate-length answers to their questions were most likely to report that they were listened to. Although it is assumed that lengthier, in-depth explanations result in higher satisfaction, this study suggests that more doctor talk does not necessarily constitute better communication.

Information on possible determinants was taken from a survey of otolaryngologists and primary care physicians in 1996 and from the 1996 Canadian census and physician demographic databases for 1996-1999., <ovid:b>PARTICIPANTS</ovid:b>: A total of 75 358 hospitalizations for TT placement of children and adolescents (aged </=14 years)., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: Small-area variation in rates of TT., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: An almost 10-fold difference between the areas with the highest and lowest rates was found (extremal quotient, 9.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 8.2-11.1; P<.001). Higher rates occurred in counties with higher percentages of high school graduates (parameter estimate, 0.01; 95% CI, 0-0.02; P =.049); and where referring physicians were more likely to be male (parameter estimate, 0.01; 95% CI, 0-0.02; P =.01), North American-trained (parameter estimate, 0.01; 95% CI, 0.01-0.02; P<.001), and have higher propensities to refer for surgery (parameter estimate, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.09-0.72; P =.02). Otolaryngologist opinion was not a significant predictor., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Substantial area variation in TT rates was observed. The opinion of primary care physicians was the dominant modifiable determinant, suggesting an area of research that may be important in reducing area variation in TT procedures.

N2  - Ossicular graft is usually considered as the reference for surgical substitution in ossiculoplasties. Nevertheless, according to the infectious risks, nothing but autografts or synthetic prosthetic substitutes should be used nowadays. Authors compare hearing results for 100 patients after ossiculoplasty with either ossicular autograft or calcium-phospathe chain reconstruction. Audiometric results were retreived using both Glasgow Benefit Plot study and post-operative air-bone gap thresholds closure. Significant hearing improvement was statistically demonstrated in both conditions, and 60% of the patients had a post-operative hearing gain. Autograft ossicular reconstructions did not show to provide higher results. Biocompatibility and functionnal properties of calcium-phosphate materials retreived in this study, indicate that those ceramic substitutes should be considered as the best alternative to autografts.

N2  - Bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA), based on the concept of osseointegration, offers the possibility of restoring hearing in case of conduction or mixed deafness. We report our experience with 87 in 74 patients implanted from 1989 to 1999. The patients were divided into two major groups, with bilateral agenesia (22 cases) or chronic otitis media (52 cases). Anatomical results are very good. We got 3 extrusions with no osseointegration, 10% local infections and 3 traumas. Functional outcome was excellent, with 73 patients being fitted with 81 HC200, HC300 or HC360 prostheses. One patient had a functional failure. We stress the importance of rigorous audiometric criteria and the determinant factors of osseointegration, essentially the surgical technique. In patients with chronic otitis, BAHA offers a functional solution for those with no benefit from an air conduction hearing aid and who are not operable or decline a new operation for tympano-ossicular reconstruction. For cases of ear malformation, BAHA can be a temporary solution that does not damage the inner ear. Indeed, rehabilitation with a BAHA does not exclude the possibility of functional tympano-ossicular surgery when the child is older and if the anatomic conditions are favorable.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Much controversy exists concerning the risk of inner ear barotrauma after stapes surgery in scuba and sky divers. Uniform consensus has not been established regarding poststapedectomy barorestrictions. The purpose of this study was (1) to determine the prevalence of adverse auditory and/or vestibular sequelae in patients after stapedectomy related to scuba and sky diving, and (2) to offer recommendations on barometric exposure after stapes surgery., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Survey questionnaires were mailed to 2222 patients who had undergone stapedectomies at a single tertiary otologic referral center between 1987 and 1998. Two hundred eight of the initial 917 respondents (22.7%) had snorkeled, scuba, or sky dived after stapes surgery, and 140 of these responded to a second questionnaire detailing dive protocols, otologic symptoms, and their relationship to the diving activities. Of the 140, 28 had scuba or sky dived. Their survey data were analyzed and their medical records were reviewed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Four of the 22 scuba divers (18.1%) experienced otologic symptoms at the time of diving. These included otalgia on descent (3/22; 13.6%), tinnitus (1/22; 4.5%), and transient vertigo on initial submersion (1/22; 4.5%). One patient had sudden sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo develop 3 months after scuba diving, which he related to noise exposure. He was subsequently found to have a perilymph fistula, which was successfully repaired. Of the 9 patients who sky dived, 2 patients (22.2%) reported otologic symptoms during the dive. No significant diving-related long-term effects indicative of labyrinthine injury were seen in any of the 28 patients., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Stapedectomy does not appear to increase the risk of inner ear barotrauma in scuba and sky divers. These activities may be pursued with relative safety after stapes surgery, provided adequate eustachian tube function has been established.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To determine the incidence of middle ear abnormalities in patients with bilateral otosclerosis, which could potentially affect successful stapedectomy, and the rates of success in these patients, including the chance of overclosure in the second ear., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective case review of operative and audiologic records., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Private otology practice., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: One thousand eight hundred patients underwent 3,600 primary stapedectomies for bilateral otosclerosis., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Analysis of perioperative and follow-up audiograms with associated operative findings, including obliterative otosclerosis and solid footplates, dehiscent or overhanging facial nerve, narrow oval window niche, promontory overhang, and ossicular fixation or malformation., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Audiologic stapedectomy success was determined as overclosure or closure of preoperative air-bone gap to less than 10 dB at 1 year or more of follow-up., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The rate of finding any abnormality was 25%. Abnormalities present bilaterally were found in 135 patients (7%), with otosclerosis requiring an oval window drillout as the most common finding (41%), followed by dehiscent or overhanging facial nerves (25%). Success in patients with abnormalities was 78% overall, with bilateral overclosure in 40%., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Abnormal middle ear findings during stapedectomy occur in a significant percentage of patients. Reasonable rates of success and overclosure can still be expected, but this is somewhat finding-specific. The predictive value of these findings, the associated rates of success with potential impact on surgical counseling, and planning for the "other ear" are discussed.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: The bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) is a well established mode of treatment and many studies show the audiological benefit, but none has assessed the benefit to the quality of life of patients. This study uses the validated Glasgow Benefit Inventory to quantify the changes in quality of life., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective questionnaire study., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Sixty consecutive patients receiving treatment with BAHA were enrolled in the study. The male/female ratio was 1.26 to 1; mean patient age was 45 years. The most common indication was hearing loss secondary to mastoid disease and surgery followed by congenital atresia and chronic discharge from the ear., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The response rate was 85%, which is high and adds weight to the results. The general benefit score was +34 (range, +27-+48), which is comparable to middle ear surgery but just below benefit from cochlear implantation. The social benefit was +21 (range, +12-+37) with only +10 (range, +2-+26) for the physical score. This pattern mirrors that reported for other ear interventions. Maximum benefit was noted in patients with congenital atresias followed by discharging mastoid cavities., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: This study is the first to demonstrate significant quality of life benefit from BAHA surgical intervention as measured by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To determine the incidence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) following stapedectomy in a patient group and the efficacy of the Epley maneuver in this group., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective study in a university-based tertiary referral system., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: The patient group comprised 63 patients who had undergone stapedectomy; a control group consisted of normal healthy individuals with no otolaryngological complaints. All individuals underwent the Dix-Hallpike maneuver for the diagnosis of BPPV. Patients who exhibited vertigo, torsional nystagmus (which reverses its direction on return to sitting position) preceded by a latent period, and the fatigability of these findings were considered to have BPPV. If the test result was positive, they underwent the Epley therapeutic maneuver., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Four of the patients who had undergone a stapedectomy showed characteristic findings of BPPV. No individual in the control group had BPPV. All patients responded well to the Epley maneuver., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Stapedectomy may be regarded as an etiological factor in BPPV. Because the fenestra is located in the posterior part of the stapes footplate, the pathophysiology appears to be related to utricular rather than saccular trauma. Correct measurement of the distance between the incus and stapes footplate is essential in stapedectomy. An Internet survey of the relevant literature in English shows a scarcity of publications on the incidence of BPPV following stapedectomy. In the present study, 63 patients who had undergone a stapedectomy were investigated for the presence of BPPV; all had Dix-Hallpike maneuvers performed for the diagnosis. Sixty-three individuals with no otolaryngological complaints made up the control group. Four of the patients who had undergone stapedectomy showed characteristic findings of BPPV, and no individual in the control group had BPPV; the difference between the two groups was statistically significant. All four of the patients diagnosed with BPPV responded well to the Epley maneuver. The pathophysiology appears to be related to utricular trauma. Correct measurement of the distance between the incus and stapes footplate is essential in stapedectomy.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study evaluates the effectiveness and safety of fiberoptic carbon dioxide (CO2) laser welding for graft closure of tympanic membrane perforations in an animal model., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING</ovid:b>: Tympanic membrane perforation was surgically induced in 11 eardrums of 7 given pigs. A lumbar facial graft was placed over the wound, and albumin drops served as a biologic solder. CO2 laser energy, transmitted through silver halide infrared transmitting fibers, was used for "spot-welding" along the circumference of the graft. The welded sites were evaluated by using a surgical microscope as well as by evaluating the sites histologically., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Healing started 3 to 4 days after surgery and was completed within 3 weeks with the formation of a neotympanum. Some inflammation with granulation tissue was noted in 5 eardrums., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE</ovid:b>: These preliminary results indicate that CO2 laser tympanoplasty with a fiberoptic delivery system may be a promising new technique for the clinical setting.

N2  - <ovid:b>HYPOTHESIS</ovid:b>: This study aimed to assess the possibility of hearing restoration after acoustic tumor removal., <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Hearing restoration surgery may be indicated after surgery of bilateral acoustic tumors or surgery of acoustic tumor in the only hearing ear. The choice is between cochlear implantation and brainstem implantation., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: From the temporal bone collection at the House Ear Institute, Los Angeles, the author histologically examined eight temporal bones from seven patients who had undergone acoustic tumor removal during their lifetime. Special emphasis was put on examining the patency of the cochlear turns and on survival of the spiral ganglion cells and cochlear nerve., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: This study showed that after translabyrinthine acoustic tumor removal, there is progressive osteoneogenesis of the cochlea associated with almost complete degeneration of the spiral ganglion cells and cochlear nerve. Similar findings were noticed after middle fossa removal of acoustic tumor with unsuccessful hearing preservation., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The histologic changes described in the cochlea and cochlear nerve represent the effects of ischemia resulting from inadvertent cutting of the blood supply during acoustic tumor removal. It is possible to do cochlear implantation after acoustic tumor removal provided that the result of promontory electrical stimulation test is positive (the cochlear nerve is intact) and that implantation is done at the time of acoustic tumor removal or shortly thereafter, before cochlear ossification is complete.

N2  - Optimal hearing is one goal of otologic surgery. This study examines the long-term functional success rate of cartilage as graft material for ossicular chain reconstruction in type III tympanoplasty. A retrospective review of seventy-nine patients having undergone type III tympanoplasty (53 with closed techniques and 26 with open techniques) was made. Lateral graft ("onlay") techniques were used in almost all cases. All operations were performed by one of the authors, a well-established otologic surgeon. Seventy-four percent of the reconstructions were performed in an one-stage procedure. The mean period of follow-up was 54 months (range 1-17 years). The results of air-bone gap closure and complications of the surgery are presented. Our results show that a significant percentage of patients gain a long-term substantial improvement in their hearing with minimal risk. However, this hearing improvement tends to decline eventually in a progressive manner. A post-operative air-bone closure equal or < 30 dB was achieved in 92.2% of the all cases (n = 79) with a mean gain of 9.72 dB. Functional outcomes in closed techniques were slightly better than in open techniques. There were few complications. Perforation and retraction of the tympanic graft were the most common observed complications. In conclusion, cartilage is an available, costless, reliable and technically easy to use graft material for functional reconstructions of the ossicular chain. It is a well-tolerated element in middle ear space as well as by the tympanic membrane, it has a very low risk of extrusion and a good long-term functional viability. Therefore, update cartilage is an interesting option in functional restoration of the ossicular chain as graft placed on the stapes capitulum.

N2  - Different policies on the treatment of tympanic membrane perforation in the pediatric age group continue to exist. Thirty patients were included in this study over a period of 2 years, where cartilage perichondrium composite graft (CPCG) was used to close the tympanic membrane perforation. Successful drum closure was achieved in 86.6% of cases, regardless of the site of perforation or the status of the operated ear. The graft was taken from the tragus and was placed in an underlay fashion with cartilage towards the promontory and the perichondrium immediately to the tympanic membrane remnants. The postoperative hearing gain although delayed up to 6 months was excellent either subjective or objective. So, CPCG has proved advantageous as a graft material to close perforation in the tympanic membrane in pediatric age group.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The antihypertensive drug clonidine is a centrally acting alpha2 agonist useful as a premedicant because of its sedative, anxiolytic, and analgesic properties. We examined the effect of clonidine given as an oral preanesthetic medication in producing a bloodless surgical field in patients undergoing middle ear microsurgery. We also evaluated whether the administration of clonidine would alter the reflex cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, anesthetic requirement, postoperative pain intensity and consumption of analgesics, and pre- and postoperative sedation and anxiety., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: A prospective, randomized, double-blind clinical trial was performed in 40 patients scheduled for elective middle ear surgery under general anesthesia. Twenty-one patients received clonidine (300 microg p.o.) 90 min prior to arrival at the operating theater and 19 received placebo (control group). The hemodynamic endpoint of the anesthetic management was maintenance of hypotension for producing a bloodless surgical field. The desired control of the cardiovascular system was attained with isoflurane (inspired concentration increments of 0.25 vol% up to a maximum of 1.5 vol%)+/-fentanyl (bolus of 1 microg. kg-1)+/-urapidil (bolus of 0.3 mg. kg-1) as needed. Intraoperative bleeding was assessed on a four-point scale from 0=no bleeding to 3=abundant bleeding., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: There was less bleeding in the clonidine group (mean+/-SEM) than in the control group (0.75+/-0.3 vs 1.1+/-0.4, P<0.05). Patients given clonidine required a mean inspired isoflurane concentration of 0.63+/-0.1 vol% as compared with 1.01+/-0.2 vol% in controls (P<0.05). Fentanyl requirements were also significantly lower (57.10 vs 79.42 microg. kg-1, P<0.05). Four clonidine-treated patients required urapidil to achieve satisfactory hypotension as compared with 11 controls (P<0.05). Clonidine attenuated the associated cardiovascular response following laryngoscopy and intubation, and was more effective than placebo in achieving a satisfactory preoperative sedation and decreasing intensity of postoperative pain. Preoperative anxiety and incidence of adverse events was similar in both groups., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Premedication with clonidine reduced bleeding in middle ear microsurgery, attenuated hyperdynamic response to tracheal intubation, and reduced isoflurane, fentanyl, and urapidil requirements for controlled hypotension.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: The authors report the results of a survey of members of the American Otological Society (AOS) and the American Neurotology Society (ANS) regarding their use of prostheses currently available for ossiculoplasty and stapedectomy. These findings are compared with a similar study presented by one of the authors in 1989., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Questionnaires were sent to the entire membership of the AOS and ANS with questions regarding biomaterial and prosthesis usage for stapes and chronic ear surgery, as well as satisfaction with each type of prosthesis used. Of the 575 questionnaires mailed, 274 (47%) were returned. Only 248 of the respondents performed middle ear surgery (43%), and their responses constitute the database for this study., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: For those respondents performing stapes surgery in both 1989 and 1999, the mean number of cases per year has increased from 32 to 37 (p < or = 0.004). The mean number of chronic ear cases has also increased from 95 in 1989 to 110 in 1999 (p < or = 0.001). As a biomaterial, hydroxyapatite prostheses are used by most surgeons (82%), followed by autograft and homograft bone (72%), autograft and homograft cartilage (62%), and Plastipore (59%). (Although 62% of respondents use cartilage, only 4.4% ranked it first in preference.) In 1989, bone was used most (93%), followed by cartilage (78%) and Plastipore (81%). Hydroxyapatite, which had just been introduced as a biomaterial, was used by only 9% of respondents. For stapes prostheses in 1999, the majority of respondents used stainless steel/platinum (71%), bucket handle (69%), or partial fluoroplastic (56%) prostheses. There was a high overall satisfaction rate in the use of most of these prostheses (> 85%), with several exceptions. The lowest satisfaction rate was 71% for Plastipore partial ossicular replacement prosthesis and total ossicular replacement prosthesis. Usage and satisfaction rates are presented for specific types of implants and compared with the earlier survey findings., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The current use of implants in middle ear surgery demonstrates a specific pattern with a high degree of user satisfaction. The preference for implants by respondents has remained stable over the past 10 years; there has been a decrease in the percentage of use of bone, cartilage, and Plastipore with a corresponding increase in the use of hydroxyapatite.

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - After using tibial cortical bone allografts in reconstructing the middle ear over a period of ten years, the authors analyze their results. They compare the functional and anatomical outcome at 4 years of 24 patients who received this allografts with a series of 25 patients who underwent incus transposition. Results were analyzed in two different ways: the Air Bone Gap and the Glasgow Benefit Plot. The discussion addresses the techniques used to reduce risks of iatrogenic transmission of viruses and prions, the current legislation in Belgium and the comparative costs, after refunding of the various reconstruction materials. The authors conclude that, because the present-day preparation techniques offer a certain security with regard to transmission risks and because of its numerous advantages (mechanical properties, tolerance, cost and availability), tibial cortical bone still has a promising future.

N2  - Among the 595 stapedotomies performed between 1992 and 1999 (surgeon R. Hausler), there were 40 cases (6.7%) where the facial nerve had an abnormal course. In 32, a partial nerve prolapse over the oval window was noted with (6 cases, 1 being a duplicated nerve around the oval window) or without (26 cases) dehiscence in the long bony canal. In 8 cases, there was a total prolapse of the nerve over the oval window, with 2 special cases: facial nerve having an inferior course over the oval window and the promontory; facial nerve being widely spread over the oval window and the promontory. Concomitant anomalies of the stapes were seen and several patients had dysmorphic syndromes with conductive hearing loss since early childhood. Stapedotomy was performed in 39 patients. In the 32 cases of partial nerve prolapse, a small piston (0.4 mm) was placed in the lower part of the oval window which was sometimes enlarged towards the promontory, except when the nerve was duplicated: the prosthesis was placed into the footplate between the nerve branches. In the 8 patients with total facial nerve prolapse, the prosthesis was either placed directly in a burr hole into the promontory just below the oval window (6 cases), or, when the nerve ran over the promontory and over the oval window, the prosthesis was placed above the oval window at the site where the facial nerve is usually located (1 case). In the case where the nerve was spread widely over the oval window and the promontory, no prosthesis was placed. In the 39 patients where a stapedotomy was performed, the average hearing level gain ranged from -15 dB to 40 dB (average: 18 dB) at 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 kHz. The average residual air-bone gap was < 30 dB in 36 patients (92.3%), < 20 dB in 30 (77%) and < 10 dB in 16 (41%). A post-operative additional hearing loss > or = 10 dB occurred in 3 cases (10, 12.5 and 12.5 dB). There were no cases of post-operative deafness or facial palsy. This analysis shows that in many cases with an aberrant course of the facial nerve, stapedotomy using adequate and sometimes non-conventional techniques can give post-operative hearing improvement.

T1  - Patients' perceived outcomes after stapedectomy for otosclerosis.
A1  - Meyer, S E

Y1  - 2000//
N2  - We conducted a retrospective study of 29 patients who had undergone stapedectomy for otosclerosis to determine how well their subjective perceptions of hearing improvement correlated with objective audiometric measurements. Patients expressed their assessments of hearing function by completing two versions of the Hearing Disability and Handicap Scale (HDHS). One version of the HDHS was based on patients' retrospective recollections of their hearing impairment prior to surgery, and the other reflected their assessment of their current function. We evaluated these HDHS data both separately and in conjunction with pre- and postoperative audiometric findings. Following surgery, the group's mean pure-tone average improved significantly, from 58 to 27 dB--that is, the average patient had a moderately severe hearing loss preoperatively and only a mild hearing loss postoperatively. Significant improvement was also reflected in the difference between the mean pre- and postoperative HDHS scores, although some patients indicated that they experienced almost no improvement. Overall, our findings indicated that there was a relationship between objective and subjective assessments of hearing improvement following surgery, but that it was weak. Although most patients perceived significant improvement, the degree of that perceived improvement cannot be predicted from the pure-tone audiogram. We conclude, therefore, that a significant difference between audiometric findings and HDHS self-assessments is useful in identifying patients who might benefit from additional counseling and/or aural rehabilitation.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Outpatient tympanomastoidectomy is common in many medical centers. However, failure of same-day discharge is often the result of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV). Many times this leads to hospital admission after tympanomastoidectomy, and it is often difficult to predict before surgery whether PONV will be an issue that impedes same-day discharge., <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To determine the clinical factors correlated with the incidence of PONV requiring hospital admission after chronic ear surgery by hypothesizing that the complexity of a particular case, as measured using a 10-point scale, is predictive of surgical time or failure of same-day hospital discharge., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective medical chart review of 103 patients having mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media over a 2-year period., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We recorded patient age, clinical data, surgical times, types of agents used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia, use of prophylactic antiemetic drugs, types and doses of analgesic agents, and PONV. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to determine which variables were associated with PONV that required hospital admission., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: One third of patients studied were safely discharged from the hospital the day of surgery, and 92% were discharged within 23 hours. The most common cause for observation admission to the hospital was PONV. The only variable in multivariate analysis that significantly correlated with PONV mandating hospital admission after tympanomastoid surgery was a history of motion sickness or PONV (odds ratio, 5.21; P =.02). Although severity of disease did not correlate with length of hospital stay, it directly correlated with length of surgery., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: A history of PONV or motion sickness is predictive of PONV and length of hospital stay. Routine planning for a 23-hour overnight observation stay seems warranted for all patients undergoing tympanomastoidectomy, despite severity of disease.

T1  - Tympanic membrane Patcher: a new device to close tympanic membrane perforations in an office setting.
A1  - Kartush, J M
Y1  - 2000//
N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess a new device intended to cover tympanic membrane (TM) perforations in an office setting., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Not all patients with TM perforations require or choose tympanoplasty surgery. Alternatives to surgery (e.g., paper and plastic onlay) have limitations that prompted a need for an alternative method. A new, simple device, designed to be inserted into the perforation, is made out of a very soft silicone in the shape of a sealed tympanostomy tube. The TM Patcher is self-stabilizing without adhesives., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: An outpatient office., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Twenty-nine patients with 30 consecutive dry TM perforations, who volunteered to participate in the study. Patients with known cholesteatomas or persistent drainage were excluded., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: In the office, patients had the Patcher inserted into their dry TM perforation. No anesthetics were needed., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Hearing was tested before and after patching by conventional audiometry. The ears were assessed for Patcher position, perforation status, and infection., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Patients with normal ossicular chains had immediate improvement of hearing. No patient experienced hearing loss. Twenty-six of 30 patients (87%) were free of infection. Two patients (7%) with persistent drainage were taken to surgery and were found to have mastoid disease (cholesteatoma or granulation tissue). Three patients (10%) had rare otorrhea after patching and were treated by drops or temporary removal of the Patcher. Two of these three ears subsequently became dry and then healed. Small perforations often healed or became smaller (46% of 3-mm perforations) despite failure of tympanoplasty or conventional office patching with a flat piece of paper or plastic. Perforations >5 mm did not heal; however, these patients simply continued wearing their Patcher and benefited by protection of their middle ear, typically with improved hearing and resolution of tinnitus. Occasional spontaneous lateralization was allowed to occur in the small perforations, which often later healed. In larger perforations, the Patcher was simply repositioned., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The Patcher is a safe and effective alternative for office patching of dry perforations when surgery is contraindicated or is refused by the patient. New materials should increase healing rates when applied to a Phase II Patcher.

N2  - Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is a connective tissue disorder characterized by osseous fragility, blue sclerae and hearing loss. In order to assess the impact of stapedotomy on improving hearing on OI, a retrospective, one-group, pre-test-post-test design was used to compare the pre-operative and post-operative audiograms of nine OI patients, treated with stapedotomy for their mixed hearing loss. Operative findings included fixation or thickening of the stapes footplate with normal superstructure configuration and hypervascularization of the promontory mucosa. Immediate post-operative results showed a significant improvement (p < 0.05) from 250-4000 Hz in air conduction and from 250-2000 Hz in bone conduction. A significant closure of the air-bone gap between 250-2000 Hz was also achieved (p < 0.05). The long-term results remained satisfactory with a mean threshold shift of 8 dB HL and an almost unchanged air-bone gap. These satisfactory results and the lack of complications make stapedotomy an appealing method for the management of OI-associated hearing loss.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To improve the techniques required to perform a stapedotomy without prosthesis (stapedioplasty)., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: New infrared lasers were evaluated for potential use in otological surgery in guinea pigs. A prospective human trial of 34 primary stapes operations using the Argon ion laser was performed, with 11 stapedioplasties and 23 conventional stapedotomies as controls., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: Laser-tissue interactions were evaluated for temporal bone and live guinea pig tissues, measuring crater histology and labyrinthine temperature elevations. Patients undergoing stapedioplasty had Argon ion laser cuts with endoscopic assistance made in the anterior crus and footplate to mobilize the posterior segment of the stapes while the anterior portion remained fixed., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Diode laser (808-nm) vaporization craters and temperature elevations in the vestibule were suitable for clinical use. Overall, stapedioplasty patients' hearing was improved with air-bone gap closure to a mean of 8.3 dB (SD +/- 9.8 dB)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Patients with anterior footplate otosclerosis are candidates for stapedioplasty preserving the annular ring and stapes tendon and eliminating prosthesis complications. High-resolution small endoscopes, coupled with Argon ion or diode lasers promise to improve stapes visualization, enhancing the ability to perform minimally invasive surgery on the stapes footplate.

N2  - In 548 stapes operations performed in Berne during the period 1994-1998, an anomaly of the course of the facial nerve was observed in 37 cases. 29 exhibited partial prolapse of the nerve over the oval window, with or without dehiscence of the bony canal, while 5 showed total prolapse of the nerve over the oval window. In one case the nerve was duplicated round the oval window and in a further instance the facial nerve was situated over the promontory and also over the oval window. In one other case the nerve was spread widely over the oval window. Concomitant anomalies of the stapes were frequently observed. The following surgical techniques were employed: in the case of partial prolapse of the nerve, a small piston was placed in the lower part of or in the oval window, which was widened towards the promontory. In cases of total prolapse of the facial nerve the prosthesis was drilled straight into the promontory. Where the nerve was duplicated the prosthesis was placed in the footplate between the nerve branches, and where the nerve ran over the promontory and over the oval window the prosthesis was placed above the oval window. In the case where the nerve was spread widely over the oval window, no prosthesis was inserted. 78% of patients had a residual air-bone gap of 20 dB or less; in only three cases did hearing fail to improve. One patient with Crouzon disease involving a complex anomaly had a hearing impairment of 22 dB. There was no deafness, facial paralysis or vertigo with nystagmus.

AB-PAS staining of epithelia revealed abundant secretory cells and their products (glycoconjugates). In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies demonstrated that the secretory cells of the middle ear mucosa with COM expressed MUC5B mucin mRNA and its product MUC5B mucin., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The MUC5B mucin gene and its product were identified in the middle ear secretory cells of patients with COM. Its expression was extensive in pseudostratified mucosal epithelia and related to infiltration of inflammatory cells in the submucosa of the middle ear cleft with COM, suggestive that inflammatory cell products are involved in the production of MUC5B.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Middle ear surgery sometimes leads to unpleasant auditory impressions such as distortion or hyperacusis that cannot be detected by conventional audiometric testing., <ovid:b>METHOD</ovid:b>: Sixty-one patients with conductive hearing loss caused by otosclerosis underwent audiological evaluation, which included a questionnaire followed by testing of the audiometric threshold, speech audiometry, and assessment and quantification of loudness perception with a commercial system (WESTRA). This investigation includes the postoperative measurement of hearing improvement and the patients' subjective impressions regarding hearing increase, distortion of speech, and hyperacusis., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Hearing improved in 88% of the patients. A quantification of this hearing increase was possible with pure tone audiometry and the Freiburg speech discrimination test. Reduced hearing threshold and lack of improvement in speech discrimination was confirmed by conventional hearing measurements. However, the presence of hyperacusis and distortion of speech could be determined by conventional audiometry in only 50% of cases. It was interesting to note that the subjects who reported speech distortion and hyperacusis in the questionnaire were identified by their increased loudness perception using the categorical loudness scaling., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: Category loudness scaling appears to be a valuable additional clinical test to characterize postoperative phenomena as distortion of speech and hyperacusis in patients undergoing stapes surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: The goal of our investigation was to facilitate research on clinical negotiation between patients and physicians by developing a reliable and valid classification system for patients' requests in office practice., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: We developed the Taxonomy of Requests by Patients (TORP) using input from researchers, clinicians, and patient focus groups. To assess the system's reliability and validity, we applied TORP to audiotaped encounters between 139 patients and 6 northern California internists. Reliability was assessed with the kappa statistic as a measure of interrater agreement. Face validity was assessed through expert and patient judgment of the coding system. Content validity was examined by monitoring the incidence of unclassifiable requests. Construct validity was evaluated by examining the relationship between patient requests and patient health status; patient request fulfillment and patient satisfaction; and patient requests and physician perceptions of the visit., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The 139 patients made 772 requests (619 requests for information and 153 requests for physician action). Average interrater agreement across a sample of 40 cases was 94% (kappa = 0.93; P <.001). Patients with better health status made fewer requests (r = -0.17; P = .048). Having more chronic diseases was associated with more requests for physician action (r = 0.32; P = .0002). Patients with more unfulfilled requests had lower visit satisfaction (r = -0.32; P <.001). More patient requests was also associated with physician reports of longer visit times (P = .016) and increased visit demands (P = .006)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Our study provides evidence that TORP is a reliable and valid system for capturing and categorizing patients' requests in adult primary care. Further research is needed to confirm the system's validity, expand its applicability, and explore its usefulness as a tool for studying clinical negotiation.

N2  - <ovid:b>STUDY OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: To determine the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting when a combination of ondansetron and promethazine is given prophylactically, and to ascertain the effect of postoperative nausea and vomiting on recovery room duration and patient satisfaction., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: University-affiliated tertiary-care hospital., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: 87 ASA physical status I and II adult patients scheduled for middle ear surgery., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: Patients were randomly assigned to receive one of the following interventions intravenously: ondansetron 4 mg (Group 1), promethazine 25 mg (Group 2), ondansetron 2 mg plus promethazine 12.5 mg (Group 3, combination), or placebo (Group 4)., <ovid:b>MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS</ovid:b>: Independent, study blinded observers recorded complaints of nausea and number of episodes of vomiting for 24 hours following the patient's first response to commands. All patients were contacted the day after discharge to inquire about nausea and vomiting. The awakening time, postanesthesia care unit and day surgery unit durations, opioid use, and side effects were recorded. At the end of the 24-hour period, the study blinded observers asked patients for an overall assessment of their global anesthesia experience using an 11-point scale. During the 24-hour period, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was reduced from 74% (placebo) to 39% (promethazine; p = 0.03) and 29% (combination; p = 0.003). Compared with placebo, the severity of vomiting was significantly less in the combination group (p = 0.04). The number of very satisfied patients correlated negatively with the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (p < 0.0001) and with the severity of vomiting (p = 0.003)., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: The prophylactic use of an antiemetic with middle ear surgery may reduce postoperative nausea and vomiting over 24 hours, and the ondansetron/promethazine combination or promethazine alone are cost-effective choices. Finally, the combination reduced significantly the severity of vomiting.

N2  - Our goal was to investigate the postoperative differences in hearing between patients who had their stapedius tendon sacrificed and those whose stapedius tendon was preserved during laser stapes surgery for otosclerosis. To that end, we performed a retrospective review by mailing extensive questionnaires to patients who had been operated on between 1994 and 1997. We also performed routine and special audiometric testing to augment the subjective data. Seventy-nine of 124 questionnaires (64%) were returned. Of the respondents, 75 patients had undergone additional pre- and/or postoperative audiometric testing, including tests to evaluate "hearing in noise" and to determine the "uncomfortable loudness level" (dynamic range). We found no statistically significant differences between the two groups with respect to their subjective responses and their audiologic test results. The responses to the questionnaire indicated that in most cases, hearing was improved by stapes surgery. We conclude that the stapedius tendon should be preserved whenever possible during stapes surgery, provided that it does not jeopardize the exposure or outcome.

N2  - Much debate exists over the management of mucosal chronic suppurative otitis media in children, with the majority of it centred around the correct timing to perform either a myringoplasty (an operative repair of the tympanic membrane) or type I tympanoplasty (reconstruction of the tympanic membrane when there is an intact and mobile ossicular chain). Further discussion will use the term tympanoplasty to mean both of the above definitions. We present the findings of a recent survey of UK ENT consultants questioning their opinions on various management aspects of mucosal CSOM in the paediatric population. We also present an extensive review of the literature to provide us with published evidence in order to analyse the results of the questionnaire.

A1  - Radpour, S
Y1  - 1999//
N2  - The outcomes of tympanoplasty in the elderly are generally no different from those in the young. Although some reports suggest that hearing results were not as good in patients older than 60, the instance of graft failure in these patients did not differ greatly by age. Patients older than 65 do have the highest incidence of perioperative death or complications, with elderly men being at a greater risk than elderly women. The risk is also higher in patients who have concomitant diseases, such as coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebral vascular disease, dementia, and peripheral vascular disease. The presence of coexisting disease is more important than age itself, although physiologic age is more important than chronological age.

N2  - Large tympanic membrane perforations usually require a surgical tympanoplasty for closure. Reducing surgical costs and risks has encouraged investigators to examine nonsurgical office procedures for healing these perforations. Growth accelerators are the most promising agents. We study here the closure of large acute perforations using weekly applications of 1 mg of 1% hyaluronic acid (HA), 0.4 microg basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), or 1.0 microg epidermal growth factor (EGF) directly to the tympanic membranes of the experimental ears. Control ears were treated with 0. 1 mL Vasocidin. Complete closure was obtained in 100% of the ears treated with HA and EGF and 85.7% of those treated with bFGF by day 21, compared with 63.6% of the controls by day 32. Moderate-to-severe ipsilateral and contralateral external canal hypertrophy was noted in 14.2% and 37.5% of the ears treated with bFGF and HA, respectively, but was not seen in ears treated with EGF or in the control group.

N2  - Among different types of lasers, the erbium laser exhibits particularly favourable characteristics for ear surgery. Experiments with application of erbium laser pulses to the isolated stapes connected to an inner ear model confirmed that there was virtually no thermal effect to the inner ear liquid and that the border damage zone on the stapes footplate perforation did not exceed 5-10 microm. Erbium laser pulses, however, produce pressure waves due to the explosive ablation of tissue. Pulses of 10 to 17 J/cm2 producing pressure waves between 140 and 160 dB appear to be a limit for clinical application. With these criteria, an in-house built erbium YAG laser with a fiberoptic delivery device was used in 15 patients for stapedotomy. A special microhandpiece, where a zirconium fluoride fiber was connected to a quartz tip, was developed. In addition, three patients had stapedotomy with a commercially available Zeiss (Opmi TwinER) microscope equipped with a micromanipulator-operated erbium laser beam. One year after surgery, the air-bone gap was closed in all patients to within 20 dB between 0.5 and 3 kHz with only minor permanent bone conduction threshold losses (< 20 dB). However, we observed an immediate postoperative middle and high frequency loss of up to 75 dB on bone conduction threshold measurements 2 h after surgery, suggesting an acoustic traumatization by the erbium laser. This threshold shift recovered close to preoperative values within 6 h. These observations prompted us to discontinue the clinical use of erbium laser for stapedotomy until the problem of temporary acoustic traumatization is resolved.

N2  - To rehabilitate most cases of conductive hearing loss closure of ear drum perforations and rebuilding of the ossicular chain can be performed. Due to the great number of biocompatible bone substitute materials available it is occasionally difficult for the surgeon to choose the most favorable substitute. Autogenous structures (ossicles, cortical bone, cartilage) and allogenous tissues (ossicles, cortical bone, cartilage, dentin) are possible bone replacement materials. Xenogenic tissue is currently not used in middle ear surgery. Ionomer cement is a hybrid material for replacement of bone but does not fit direct classification of the various classes of alloplastic materials in current use: that is, metals (gold, steel wire, platinum, titanium), plastics (polyethylene, polytetrafluorethylene) and ceramics (ceramic oxide, carbon, calcium-phosphate ceramic, vitreous ceramic). For restoration of the sound conductive apparatus preference is given to autogenous ossicles because cortical bone is resorbed and cartilage weakens over time. Most surgeons do not use allogenous tissue, because of the possible transmission of such infectious disease as immunodeficiency syndrome or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Only dentin deserves special attention as a possible bone substitute in the middle ear because its form can be preserved during sterilization. Based on the observations available to date, it becomes apparent that titanium implants hold greater promise than gold. Form-stable synthetic materials are not generally recommended due to foreign body reactions which have been confirmed by many investigators. Ceramic materials (e.g. ceramic oxide, carbon, calcium-phosphate ceramic, glass ceramic) are well tolerated in the middle ear and have also proved to be useful over time. Hybrid bone substitute ionomer cement is easily workable and well integrated, showing a good functional outcome. For many years good results in otosclerosis surgery have been achieved with a prosthesis made of platinum-wire and Teflon. Short-term follow-up periods hold great promise with pistons made of gold. Autogenous ossicles, ionomer cement and recently titanium protheses--as far as usable--are employed by the author for reconstructing the middle ear. For the time being platinum-Teflon prostheses and gold are used in otosclerosis surgery.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: To determine the applicability of alloplastic materials as bone substitutes it is now standard procedure to test materials for possible toxic effects and to study their behavior in animal models and cell cultures. This is especially important with respect to middle ear implants that can be put at risk by recurrent infections and require additional testing in a bacterially contaminated environment., <ovid:b>MATERIALS AND METHODS</ovid:b>: In the present study ionomeric cement (V-O CEM), bioactive glass ceramic and hydroxyapatite were subjected to contamination with S. aureus, E. coli, Pr. mirabilis, Ps. aeruginosa and Enterococci using agar diffusion and microbial suspension tests and examined for their antibacterial activity. A special feature of V-O CEM that had to be considered was that it could be implanted in two physical states (as a viscous substance and a fully hardened material)., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The agar diffusion test showed that an antibacterial effect of freshly mixed V-O CEM was demonstrable for up to 60 min. In the microbial suspension test growth of E. coli was found to be promoted after 48-h incubation by V-O CEM set for 1 h. S. aureus exhibited a depressed growth, while Pseudomonas cultures demonstrated cell death after 48 h. V-O CEM set for 24 h and 7 days, respectively, exerted a similar though less pronounced effect. Using the microbial suspension test, a comparison was also made of the antibacterial activities of 24-h V-O CEM, bioactive glass ceramic and hydroxyapatite against cultures of S. aureus, Pseudomonas and E. coli. The inhibitory effect of hydroxyapatite on the growth of S. aureus was found to persist beyond the 48-h incubation period. There was slight growth of E. coli in the presence of bioactive glass ceramic after 48 h, whereas hydroxyapatite produced inhibition of microbial growth. V-O CEM inhibited the growth of Pseudomonas, unlike bioactive glass ceramic and hydroxyapatite, which transiently promoted bacterial growth., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Our findings showed that V-O CEM, bioactive glass ceramic and hydroxyapatite exhibited material-dependent bacterial colonization and thus resembled polymeric bone substitutes (susceptible to invasion by S. epidermidis) and metals (sensitive to S. aureus). In general, users of bone substitutes should conduct preclinical tests in order to obtain advance information on the properties of possible replacement material. Since there can be varying interactions between the materials studied and bacterial growth, material-specific effects on bacterial growth should be investigated. While it is recognized that in vitro studies are an inadequate simulation of the clinical situation, they still provide some insight into the likely behavior of a bone substitutes in human sites.

N2  - Absence of the long process of the incus with or without absence of the stapes head accounts for more than 80% of ossicular discontinuities. Total or partial replacement prostheses, made of various materials, are interposed to restore the transfer function of the middle ear. To simplify ossicular reconstruction, reduce operative times and costs, improve functional outcomes, and avoid the risk of infections, we have adopted, during the past 10 years, a technique that makes use of a personally designed alloplastic prosthetic device. The prosthesis connects the malleus to the footplate, even in the presence of the stapes superstructure. This malleus-to-footplate prosthesis consists in a plastipore-coated steel piston and hydroxyapatite head, complete with a groove. The groove is placed beneath the malleus neck after dissection of the tensor tympani tendon and the shaft of the piston on the footplate. Two hundred ninety primary ossiculoplasties with the malleus-to-footplate prostheses were performed in 265 patients from 1986 to 1995 in the ENT Department of the University of Verona. The average postoperative air-bone gap at 0.5 to 3 kHz was 11 dB at 1 year and 14 dB at 5 years. These outcomes are significantly better than those personally obtained previously with ossicular or alloplastic prostheses. No extrusions occurred. The structural characteristics of the malleus-to-foot-plate prosthesis endow the prosthesis with a high degree of biocompatibility and stability and optimal sound-transfer function. The rationale for this particular ossiculoplasty procedure is discussed.

N2  - One hundred sixty-five middle ear procedures were performed with an endoscope, a camera, and a video monitor instead of the microscope. The endoscope offers the following advantages: 1) it visualizes the whole tympanic membrane and the ear canal without having to manipulate the patient's head or the microscope, 2) it extends the operative field in transcanal procedures into structures usually hidden from the microscope (anterior tympanic perforation, posterior retraction pocket, facial recess, and hypotympanum), and 3) it visualizes structures from multiple angles as opposed to the microscope's single axis along the ear canal. Disadvantages of the endoscope include the one-handed surgical technique, a loss of depth perception, limited magnification, and the need for training. The endoscope holds the greatest promise in tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma surgery and should increase the utilization of transcanal over postauricular procedures.

N2  - In the otological literature, the results of middle ear surgery are frequently reported by closure of the air-bone gap and improvement of the air-conduction threshold in dB HL. These parameters are valid as a reflection of the technical success, but do not evaluate the effect of surgery on binaural hearing. In the literature two methods have been proposed for predicting patient benefit in reconstructive middle ear surgery: the Rule of Thumb and the Glasgow Benefit Plot. Both methods are based on the arbitrary cut-off level of 30 dB HL for normal or socially acceptable hearing. However, a reliable preoperative prediction of patient benefit can only be made after validation of the definition of normal or socially acceptable hearing expressed in dB HL by means of a questionnaire measuring the limitations of adequate hearing. A clear relationship is found between the subjective hearing ability and the air-conduction thresholds that supports 30 dB HL as the cut-off level for normal or socially acceptable hearing. Further validation of this cut-off level in a more extensive prospective study is needed to provide a significant prognosis for normal or socially acceptable hearing.

N2  - Fixed head malleus syndrome is a rare anatomoclinical entity first described by Goodhill in 1966. We present a series of 9 patients who underwent surgery between 1991 and 1997 and discuss the technical procedures used and functional outcome. Ossicular mobility can be re-established with two surgical methods. The more simple method consists in a classical incus transposition with malleus neck section. The more physiological method consists in drilling the synostosis fixing the malleus without disrupting the ossicular chain; stapedotomy is associated in certain cases (Type III).

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: This study aimed to challenge the classical hypothesis that a negative preoperative 512-Hz Rinne tuning fork test (bone conduction greater than air conduction) is a necessary condition to allow consistent objective and subjective hearing improvement with surgery for otosclerosis., <ovid:b>STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: The study design was retrospective (chart review and questionnaire)., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: The study was conducted at a Florida Ear and Sinus Center at Sarasota, Florida, a tertiary otology-neurotology referral center., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Patients who underwent primary laser stapedotomy with equivocal (air=bone) preoperative 512-Hz Rinne test results participated., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: KTP laser stapedotomy was performed., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Audiologic measurements of air-bone gap closure and patient assessment of hearing improvement and satisfaction were conducted., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The air-bone gap was closed to within 10 dB in all cases. There were no complications. Eighteen patients were questioned about their results. Hearing improvement was subjectively described as "excellent" or "good" by 17 (94%), and 16 (89%) thought the surgery was "absolutely" worthwhile., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: The preoperative 512-Hz Rinne test results need not be negative to achieve significant air-bone gap closure and subjective appreciation of improved hearing.

N2  - This study reports the evaluation of the hearing results after 62 implantations of a pure gold (99.9%) piston in cases of otosclerosis. A retrospective analysis of the pre- and postsurgery audiological results of these patients was carried out by microcomputer. This study shows that the use of a pure gold piston ((K-piston) with a diameter of 0.4 mm gives good results in cases of stapedotomy for otosclerosis. The hearing results show a closure of the pure-tone average (PTA) air-bone gap to within 10 dB was 70.9% (44/62) and to within 20 dB in 95.1% (59/62). A residual airbone-gap of > 20 dB was seen in three cases (4.8%). A postoperative overclosure of bone conduction thresholds was discovered for all frequencies measured. Sensorineural hearing loss (> 10%) did not occur and there was no decline in the speech discrimination. The future for this new generation of stapes pistons seems to be promising.

N2  - Long-term outcomes of surgery have been analysed for 684 patients with OMCP in terms of possible implications of the severity and kind of pathological processes in the middle ear as well as the operative procedure on functional and anatomic results of tympanoplasty. Early surgical interventions in OMCP are preferable because they allow "closed" tympanoplasty. Maximal removal of hypertrophic inflammation-affected parts of the tympanic mucosa promotes functional effectiveness of the operation in view of higher position of the stapes achieved with the help of combined prostheses. The "open" variant of the operation performed because of cholesteatoma is made with maximal removal of the posterior bone wall of the external acoustic meatus in order to revise facial and tympanic sinuses and to enable better conditions for cavity to exercise postoperative self-cleaning.

N2  - The efficacy of hyaluronic acid (HA) foam in the prevention of middle ear adhesions and other structural abnormalities in guinea pigs undergoing experimental tympanoplasty was investigated. Postoperative changes in the middle ear were evaluated by light microscopy after 6 weeks. The presence of adhesions, diminution of airspace, new bone formation, tympanic membrane (TM) formation, and mucosal inflammation was characterized by an objective grading system. Results were compared to absorbable gelatin sponge (AGS) and a control group (no middle ear packing). The control group showed the best average scores for all parameters tested except for adhesion formation. However, these results were statistically significant only when compared with those of the AGS group for airspace preservation, new bone formation, and TM formation. Although the HA foam group showed better average results than did the AGS group for all parameters tested, none were statistically significant. Although HA foam appears to be a promising middle ear packing agent, further experimental trials are warranted before any firm conclusions may be made.

N2  - Four Plastipore prostheses, removed at revision surgery 7-10 years after implantation, have been examined. The gross appearance of the prostheses was preserved. The prostheses were surrounded by a fibrous tissue capsule and showed fibrous tissue ingrowth localized in peripheral zones. Foreign-body giant cells and macrophages were detected in small numbers. Histologic evidence of breakdown of the prostheses, in the form of microdisintegration of the walls of micropores, was detected on a small scale. Compared to the massive foreign-body reactions reported in short-term studies, the tissue reaction apparently subsides with time and becomes insignificant. Strict criteria for insertion should be regarded.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To assess the prognostic value of pathologic and technical variables influencing the functional outcome of tympanoplasty., <ovid:b>PATIENTS AND STUDY DESIGN</ovid:b>: Retrospective review of the records of 544 patients affected by chronic otitis with or without cholesteatoma, operated on by the senior author in a city hospital ENT department. Follow-up was provided systematically by the same institution., <ovid:b>INTERVENTIONS</ovid:b>: These included tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy in 339 cases, canal wall up technique in 134 cases, and canal wall down in 71 cases. Three hundred twenty-six (60%) were primary, and 218 (40%) were revision procedures. Myringoplasty was performed with autologous temporalis fascia, ossiculoplasty with incus interposition, or partial or total ossicular prostheses. Mean follow-up was 14 months (range, 12-50 months)., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES</ovid:b>: Hearing results were defined according to the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium Guidelines. A one-way analysis of variance was used to determine group differences. Multiple logistic regression analysis was subsequently carried out on the different pathology groups via the hierarchical log linear model. A probability value of p < 0.05 was the level of significance., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The status of the mucosal lining, the mastoidectomy, the availability of the malleus handle, and the tympanic membrane perforation were all significantly predictive of the hearing outcome but with differing weight according to the pathologic condition., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Anatomic and technical factors diversely affect the functional outcome of tympanoplasty. A better knowledge of their predictive roles and weights may be useful in both the surgeon's judgment and in the information given to the patient.

N2  - In order to prevent complications which occur in classical stapedoplasty, authors applied a new atraumatic procedure in 138 patients with otosclerosis. Along with preserved ossicular chain, stapedotomy was performed and a piston-wire prosthesis placed. Disarticulation of incudostapedial joint was the next part of the procedure with removal of suprastructure of the stapes. Early and late cochlear disorders were rare while the final functional effects were much better. This paper analyzes numerous advantages of this procedure with directives for promotion of our work in the future.

N1  - Comment in (CIN)
N2  - Electrocochleography (ECoG) is an objective, electrophysiologic test useful in the clinical diagnosis of endolymphatic hydrops, or Meniere's disease. The purpose of this study was to determine if the position of the needle, using transtympanic methodology, gives a variable SP/AP (summating potential/action potential) response. SP/AP ratios were obtained during routine tympanoplasty procedures. After the tympanic membrane remnant was removed using a lateral graft technique, precise needle placement was obtained at the medial and lateral round window niches, as well as on the promontory. SP/AP ratios were obtained in these three needle positions. There was no significant difference in the SP/AP ratio responses despite the location of needle placement. The use of transtympanic electrocochleography can give very good wave form morphology and consistent results. Therefore, if elevated SP/AP ratios do occur, they are thought to be due to a pathologic process of the ear and not needle placement.

N2  - Cartilage has shown promise as a graft material to close perforations in the tympanic membrane (TM), particularly in cases of advanced middle ear pathology. Although it is similar to fascia, its more rigid quality tends to resist resorption and retraction. However, it is this rigid quality that has led many to anticipate a significant conductive hearing loss when using cartilage to reconstruct the TM. Because little has been reported in the literature comparing hearing results using cartilage with results using other grafting materials, this retrospective study was conducted to compare the hearing results of patients with cartilage tympanoplasty with results in patients who underwent revision tympanoplasty using perichondrium. Both series of patients had undergone type I tympanoplasty, and the middle ear pathology was considered to be similar between the two groups. TM closure was achieved in all 22 patients undergoing cartilage reconstruction, but three of the 20 patients undergoing perichondrium reconstruction had a recurrent perforation during the follow-up period (approximately 1 year). The average pre- and postoperative pure-tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG) was 21.1 dB and 6.8 dB for the cartilage group and 17.9 dB and 7.7 dB for the perichondrium group, respectively. These gains in hearing were statistically significant (P < 0.001 in each case), but there was no statistically significant difference in hearing results between the two groups. Analysis of the PTA-ABG as a function of percentage of TM reconstructed showed no statistically significant difference in hearing results due to percentage of cartilage used. These results indicate that cartilage tympanoplasty offers the possibility of a rigorous TM reconstruction with excellent postoperative hearing results.

N2  - <ovid:b>BACKGROUND</ovid:b>: Presently, there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved adhesive bone cements for the surgical fixation of prosthetic materials in the middle ear. A promising new cement, 4-META/MMA-TBB opaque resin, has shown remarkable adhesive properties as a bone cement in vivo. The cement is composed of 4-methacryloyloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride (4-META) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) as monomers and tri-n-butyl borane (TBB) as an initiator., <ovid:b>METHODS</ovid:b>: An electromagnetic semiimplantable hearing device presently under development was implanted into the middle ear of six cats using 4-META/MMA-TBB resin to cement a titanium-encased magnet to the incus. The animals were subsequently killed (at a mean of 9.6 months) to assess the (temporal bones and specifically the magnet-incus complex in each animal., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: The titanium-encapsulated magnet was firmly adherent to all incuses without any failure of the cement-bone interface. Histopathologic examination of the implanted temporal bones demonstrated lack of middle ear inflammation. Transmission electron microscopy of the incuses demonstrated a unique "hybrid layer" in the bone-side subsurface of the bone-cement interface that elucidates the mechanism of interfacial adhesion., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Our investigation highlights the special biomechanical properties as well as the biocompatibility of 4-META/ MMA-TBB resin that make it an attractive bone-bonding agent for use in otologic surgery, including its potential usefulness during ossicular reconstruction.

N2  - Absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam) has been used for many years in middle ear surgery. Although the sponge is generally well tolerated, fibrosis occasionally forms in the mesotympanum; some studies indicated that the absorbable gelatin sponge may be responsible. Many of these studies lack statistical analysis. We prospectively studied three absorbable hemostatic agents in the middle ear of adult male Sprague-Dawley rats to determine which promotes fibrosis to the greatest degree: absorbable gelatin sponge (Gelfoam), absorbable gelatin sheet (Gelfilm), or absorbable collagen sheet (Instat). The materials were implanted in the middle ear through a post-auricular approach and the temporal bones were serially harvested at different time intervals so we could examine histologic changes. The nonimplanted ear served as surgical control. Examination of the specimens at 6, 8, and 10 weeks by light microscopy revealed that although absorbable gelatin film and collagen-absorbable hemostat are well tolerated in this animal model, absorbable gelatin sponge promoted the presence of fibrosis to a significantly greater degree, (p = 0.0344). We conclude that absorbable gelatin sponge promotes fibrosis more frequently than do collagen-absorbable hemostat and absorbable gelatin film in this animal model.

N2  - Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), or the Van der Hoeve-de Kleyn syndrome, is a heterogeneous group of connective tissue disorders. The key features in this disease are bone fragility with a tendency to spontaneous fractures and deformations. The classical traid of symptoms involves a conductive and/or sensorineural hearing impairment together with a tendency to spontaneous bone fractures and blue sclerae. Between January 1988 and December 1994, ear surgery was performed on eight ears of six OI patients who presented with mixed hearing loss preoperatively. Pathological changes observed in the middle ear were atrophy and/or fractures of the stapedial crura in combination with thickening and fixation of the stapes footplate. Partial stapedectomy was performed in seven cases and a neo-window was created in the promontory of one patient when an overhanging facial canal obscured visualization of the oval window niche. Pre- and postoperative bone conduction thresholds did not differ in any of the patients. Postoperatively, mean values of the air-bone gap in the main speech frequency range were below 10 dB. Functional results following stapes surgery in patients with otosclerosis during the same time interval (n = 857) did not differ significantly. These data indicate that stapes surgery in OI patients can be performed with the same functional predictability as in otosclerosis patients, even though the underlying etiology is considerably different.

N2  - In a type IV tympanoplasty, the stapes footplate is directly exposed to incoming sound while the round window is "shielded," usually with a fascia graft. Postoperative hearing results are quite variable, with air-bone gaps ranging from 10 to 60 dB. A cadaveric human temporal bone preparation was developed to investigate the middle ear mechanics of this operation to identify causes of variable results and to test predictions of a recently described theoretic model of type IV tympanoplasty. The ear canal, tympanic membrane, malleus, and incus were removed so as to expose the stapes and round window to the sound stimulus. A "cavum minor" chamber (air space adjacent to the round window) was constructed around the round window niche. The round window could be isolated from sound by placing an acoustic shield over this chamber. The mechanical properties of the shield, cavum minor, annular ligament, and round window membrane were varied experimentally. Stapes velocity as determined by an optical motion sensor was used as a measure of hearing level. The largest stapes velocity occurred with a mobile stapes and round window, a stiff shield, and a well-aerated cavum minor. Partial fixation of the stapes or round window caused a decrease in stapes velocity. Acoustic shields of conchal cartilage or Silastic silicone rubber sheeting (approximately 1 mm thick) provided near-optimal shielding. A temporalis fascia shield resulted in a stapes velocity 10 to 20 dB less than that seen with a cartilage or Silastic silicone rubber shield at low frequencies. A cavum minor air space as small as 16 microL was sufficient for unrestricted stapes motion, provided the air was in contact with the round window membrane. These results qualitatively matched predictions of our model, but there were some quantitative differences. The clinical implications of our results are that in order to optimize postoperative hearing, the surgeon should 1) preserve normal stapes mobility, preferably by covering the footplate with a very thin split-thickness skin graft, not a fascia graft; 2) reinforce a fascia shield with cartilage or Silastic silicone rubber; 3) create conditions that promote aeration of the round window niche; and 4) preserve the mobility of the round window membrane.

N2  - Preservation of the posterior canal wall in mastoidectomy is essential for rebuilding normal tympanum and conductive structures, and has been widely recommended. However, controversies remain about the technique due to its complications and diverse results reported. This paper analysed the causes of four failed cases in detail and proposed measure to reduce morbidities and promote success. The review includes case selection, operation staging, surgical techniques and lesion removal etc.

N2  - The use of local anaesthesia for middle ear surgery is long established and has many advantages. However, it is only performed by a small number of UK otolaryngologists (20%). This lack of enthusiasm is due to concerns that patients may not tolerate the discomfort during the operation. Therefore, a survey was conducted on patients who had middle ear operations: stapedotomy, myringoplasty, ossiculoplasty and mastoidectomy. The intense sensation of noise during the operation (29.6% of patients) and anxiety (24%) were the most common discomforts, followed by dizziness (14.8%), backache (13.9%), claustrophobia (9.3%) and earache (1.9%). In spite of these discomforts, 89% of patients still preferred local anaesthesia to general anaesthesia for a similar procedure. The author suggests that good patient selection, pre-operative explanation and the use of appropriate sedation are the important factors for local anaesthesia ear procedures to be acceptable to patients.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To identify a consensus on the postoperative barorestrictions after stapes surgery and to examine the clinical barotrauma experience within this patient population encountered by the surveyed physicians., <ovid:b>DATA SOURCE</ovid:b>: A 34-item survey was developed, allowing for detailed analysis of physician demographic data, practice characteristics, surgical experience, and clinical experience with barotrauma after stapes surgery. The postoperative restrictions addressed by the survey included those for air travel, snorkeling, and scuba diving. Recommendations for the use of ventilation tubes and hyperbaric oxygen therapy were investigated as well., <ovid:b>STUDY SELECTION</ovid:b>: Surveys were mailed to 419 active members of the American Otological Society and the American Neurotology Society as listed in the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) 1994-1995 Conjoint Directory. A total of 284 (67.8%) surveys were returned, of which 53 were not sufficiently completed and were excluded in the statistical analysis., <ovid:b>DATA EXTRACTION</ovid:b>: The demographic data and clinical experience were analyzed to determine statistical association with the postoperative recommendations using chi 2 or Fisher's exact tests. The kappa statistic was used as a measure of consistency between physicians' recommended restriction for a specific activity after a stapedectomy or stapedotomy., <ovid:b>CONCLUSION</ovid:b>: No consensus was demonstrated as to restrictions from activities such as air travel, snorkeling, or scuba diving. Despite this lack of consensus, no significant difference was demonstrated in the prevalence of barotrauma reported within the responding physicians' practices based on their individual recommendations for these activities.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - This study was performed to investigate the efficacy of esmolol, an agent used in hypotensive anesthesia for middle ear surgery. We compared 20 ASA I-II patients to 20 controls in whom we administered routine anesthesia. All patients were premedicated with intramuscular 0.05 mg/kg atropine, 1 mg/kg pethidine and 25 mg promethazine. Anesthesia was induced with 0.004 mg/kg fentanyl and 5 mg/kg thiopental sodium. Succinylcholine 1.5 mg/kg was administered to facilitate intubation. Isoflurane, nitrous oxide, oxygen, 0.08 mg/kg vecuronium bromide and controlled ventilation were used for anesthetic maintenance. Before the controlled hypotensive period, nitrous oxide was discontinued and an esmolol infusion started. We registered hemodynamic values (via noninvasive and invasive radial artery cannulation), central venous pressure, electrocardiography, body temperature, end-tidal carbon dioxide levels, periferal oxygen saturation, and arterial blood gas analysis. Mean infusion rate of esmolol was 330 +/- 10 micrograms/kg/min. We found significant decreases in systolic blood pressure (28.7%), mean blood pressure (26.5%) and diastolic blood pressure (33.4%). The operative field was virtually bloodless. Hemodynamic values recovered to normal or to within -12.45% of normal at the end of intravenous esmolol infusion. During the postoperative period, no side effects were observed. In conclusion, esmolol is an appropriate hypotensive agent for patients undergoing middle ear surgery under hypotensive anesthesia because it yields no side effects, it is easy to control administration and it provides the desired degree of hypotension without complications.

Y1  - 1996//
N2  - Craniometaphyseal dysplasia (CMD) is a genetic bone disorder involving an abnormality of modeling of the long bones and sclerosis of the cranium. Both conductive and sensorineural hearing may be frequently associated with this syndrome. Conductive hearing loss is due to attic fixation of the lateral ossicular chain and hyperostosis formation with stapes ankylosis. Two patients with CMD were treated surgically. Two of three ears operated on had closure of the air-bone gap, whereas the third ear failed ossicular reconstruction because of hyperostosis of the promontory with deepening of the oval window.

N2  - In order to identify factors that could influence the success of tympanoplasties in adults, a retrospective study of 291 tympanoplasties performed on patients aged 15 years and older during the years 1984-1989 was carried out. Surgical success was defined as an intact membrane after two years follow-up and hearing improvement of at least 15 decibels. The success rate of the tympanoplasties was 90%. A functioning eustachian tube was found to be important for graft take. No difference was found in the rate of graft take regardless of whether fascia of the temporal muscle or tragal perichondrium was used or if fibrin glue was used. An audiological improvement was seen in 77% of the patients, and no significant difference regarding hearing gain was found between the different prostheses. It is concluded that tympanoplasty in adults is a simple operation with a high probability of success which can improve the quality of life of those operated upon.

N2  - <ovid:b>INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES</ovid:b>: Comparison of reports of the functional results of middle-ear surgery is difficult because there are no standardized criteria, such as; auditory activity, histology, evaluation of functional results, follow-up period, etc. Moreover, surgeons and patients often disagree over the results obtained. The functional results obtained in 246 middle-ear operations performed in our department for postotorrhea sequelae were analyzed., <ovid:b>MATERIAL AND METHOD</ovid:b>: Using the SMYTH and PATTERSON criteria, benefits were analyzed in 246 patients for whom functional results were available., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Benefits were analyzed by type of surgery, type of ossiculoplasty, presence or absence of stapedial superstructure, and subjective patient assessment., <ovid:b>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Results were analyzed as surgical evaluation of functional outcome in relation to subjective patient assessment. Guidelines for standardizing criteria for the functional evaluation of middle-ear surgery are proposed.

N2  - The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) is a measure of patient benefit developed especially for otorhinolaryngological (ORL) interventions. Patient benefit is the change in health status resulting from health care intervention. The GBI was developed to be patient-oriented, to be maximally sensitive to ORL interventions, and to provide a common metric to compare benefit across different interventions. The GBI is an 18-item, postintervention questionnaire intended to be given to patients to fill in at home or in the outpatient clinic. In the first part of the paper, five different ORL interventions were retrospectively studied: middle ear surgery to improve hearing, provision of a cochlear implant, middle ear surgery to eradicate ear activity, rhinoplasty, and tonsillectomy. A criterion that was specific to the intervention was selected for each study, so that the patient outcome could be classified as above and below criterion. In all five interventions, the GBI was found to discriminate between above- and below-criterion outcomes. The second part of the paper reports on the results and implications of a factor analysis of patient responses. The factor structure was robust across the study, and so led to the construction of subscales. These subscales yield a profile score that provides information on the different types of patient benefit resulting from ORL interventions. The GBI is sensitive to the different ORL interventions, yet is sufficiently general to enable comparison between each pair of interventions. It provides a profile score, which enables further breakdown of results. As it provides a patient-oriented common metric, it is anticipated that the GBI will assist audit, research, and health policy planning.

N2  - <ovid:b>SUMMARY</ovid:b>: Agenesis of the cervical portion of the internal carotid artery (ICA) may result in blood supply to the ipsilateral cerebral hemisphere being provided by an enlarged inferior tympanic branch of the ascending pharyngeal artery. This enlarged vessel, passing through Jacobson's canal and anastomosing with the likewise enlarged caroticotympanic branch of the ICA in front of the promontorium, may simulate a middle ear mass. We present five patients with this unusual anatomical variant, three of which underwent biopsy of what was believed to be a middle ear tumour. One patient experienced rupture of an arterial aneurysm in the middle ear successfully treated with endovascular application of detachable platinum coils. It is mandatory for ENT-surgeons and radiologists who perform head-and-neck examinations to recognize this anatomical variant, not mistaking it for a tumour, since biopsy of a large artery supplying the brain may have disastrous consequences. In patients with otorrhagia, an arterial aneurysm must be considered as a possible source of bleeding, in some cases amenable for treatment with an endovascular technique. The diagnosis of "aberrant internal carotid artery"" is usually made with CT of the temporal bone or MR of the skull base. Cerebral angiography is in most cases not necessary, unless an endovascular procedure is planned.

N2  - The authors present their combined experience with large cartilage-perichondrial composite grafts used to reconstruct total tympanic membrane perforations in 294 ears. Patients chosen for this procedure had failed earlier tympanoplasty surgery or were identified as poor candidates for conventional facial tympanoplasty because of the perforation size. Successful perforation closure was achieved in 97% of ears with chronic otitis media characterized by absence of the tympanic membrane, including portions of the anterior annular ligament. Hearing results in general were good, considering the advanced stage of the disease, which required the use of alloplastic ossicular prostheses (PORP and TORP) in 76% of ears. Hearing improvement was maximal at 2000 Hz regardless of the method of ossicular reconstruction. Closure of the air-bone gap at this frequency to within 10 dB was achieved in 87% of type I tympanoplasties, 73% of type III (PORP), and 70% of type III (TORP) tympanoplasties. Although cartilage autografts have also been promoted to reverse tympanic membrane atelectasis, the authors believe that the above preoperative conditions are strong indications for this grafting technique, which is described in detail.

N2  - One hundred sixty-two otosclerotic patients who underwent a stapedotomy between October 1991 and April 1994 were examined after experiencing postoperative vertigo. Twenty-eight complained of dizziness. In sixteen patients, we observed vertigo and nystagmus only within the first six postoperative days; in these cases, special treatment was not necessary. However, in twelve patients in whom vertigo persisted even after their stay in the hospital, the problem seriously affected their quality of life and their return to work. In these cases, an individualized diagnostic and therapeutic procedure was indicated. Case reports demonstrate the usefulness of several diagnostic methods (analysis of the case history, audiogram, investigation of the vestibular system, and elimination of non-vestibular causes of vertigo. But only high-resolution computed tomography scans of the temporal bone showed definite results. Air bubbles at the end of the prosthesis as indirect sign of perilymphatic fistula, bad position of the piston, new centers of otosclerosis, cicatrices, and in one case fracture of the prosthesis. Ten of the twelve patients required revision surgery. In most patients with persisting vertigo following stapedotomy, revision surgery was justified. However, high-resolution computed tomography is recommended.

N2  - Among 42 Japanese patients with otosclerosis who underwent stapes surgery, 22 patients including 10 received total stapedectomy, 6 partial stapedectomy and 6 stapedectomy, were investigated on preoperative and postoperative tinnitus by sending questionnaire. The tinnitus was evaluated by "tinnitus score" advocated by the Japan Audiological Society, and the changes of the scores were analyzed according to pre- and postoperative hearing change, type of stapes surgery and pitches of preoperative tinnitus. In these 22 patients, tinnitus score was improved in 68%, unchanged in 27% or worsened in 5%. Tinnitus was completely disappeared in 6 patients or 27.3%. Tinnitus score became more markedly improved in the patients received partial stapedectomy or stapedotomy than those who received total stapedectomy. Tinnitus score was more likely improved in the patients who had a low pitched tinnitus and presumably had no cochlear otosclerosis preoperatively.

N2  - The inverse procedure in stapedoplastic with the primary stapedectomy was done in 55 patients with otosclerosis. The early cochleo-vestibular disorders (1.8-3.6%), graver sensoneural damage after 6 months (1.8%) and bone--air conduction gap were significantly better in relation to the patients operated in classical way. Many advantages of inverse procedure were analyzed in prevention of inner ear lesions and better functional outcome.

N2  - <ovid:b>OBJECTIVE</ovid:b>: To analyze clinical presentation, modes of detection, growth pattern, operative findings, and results of surgery in children 3 years old or older who had extensive congenital cholesteatoma (keratoma)., <ovid:b>DESIGN</ovid:b>: Survey, case series., <ovid:b>SETTING</ovid:b>: Two academically affiliated medical centers: a children's hospital and an eye, ear, and throat hospital, both located in major metropolitan cities., <ovid:b>PATIENTS</ovid:b>: Twenty-five children selected according to specified criteria., <ovid:b>INTERVENTION</ovid:b>: Tympanomastoid surgery, ie, canal wall up and canal wall down, some with ossicular reconstructive surgery., <ovid:b>MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE</ovid:b>: Audiologic assessment (speech reception threshold) and recurrence (recidivism) of cholesteatoma., <ovid:b>RESULTS</ovid:b>: Incidence of recidivism, 52%. Hearing maintained within the range of normal to mild hearing impairment postoperatively in 91% of the patients for whom complete data are available., <ovid:b>CONCLUSIONS</ovid:b>: Congenital cholesteatoma may grow for years without causing signs or symptoms and, having grown without early detection, can extend to involve the epitympanum and mastoid antrum, cause ossicular erosion, and even extend to the middle cranial fossa. To adequately remove a congenital cholesteatoma that has gone undetected for many years, exposure of the anterior epitympanum is often necessary and removal of both the body of the incus and the head of the malleus often is required. Since congenital cholesteatoma usually develops in a child with a well-pneumatized mastoid that would create a large mastoid bowl if exteriorized, the otologic surgeon is likely to hesitate in using the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique. Alternatives to the canal wall down mastoidectomy technique, which can achieve reasonably good hearing results and avoid creation of a large mastoid bowl, include planned two-stage canal wall up surgery or canal preservation with primary reconstruction and close follow-up with otomicroscopy and serial computed tomographic scans.

N2  - Hearing conservation or gain are important parameters of tympanoplastic surgery. The frequency of this surgical procedure and the difficulty in obtaining tissues due to the increased risk of H.I.V. transfer has made the use of synthetic products somewhat more acceptable in contrast with the use of organic substances (homograft ossicles, bone, cartilage and perichondrium, etc...). We have been using tissues of the same patient (50), during a period of three years with a specimen constituted of cartilage and perichondrium designed as a "butterfly" and with very promising tympanoplastic and functional results. The tympanoplastic results were evaluated eighteen months postoperatively as follows: good: 86%, aural discharges that disappeared later 12%, perforations: 0%, keratin neoformations: 2%. Functional results were evaluated three years later as follows: gain more than 15 dB: 72%, same: 14%, worse: 14%.

Of 467 questionnaires, 176 (38%) were returned, and 319,410 stapes cases were statistically analyzed: 329 reparative granulomas were reported after stapedectomy (incidence = 0.1%) and 29 after stapedotomy (incidence = 0.07%); 77 surgeons reported having encountered at least one reparative granuloma; and 50 surgeons related the occurrence of a reparative granuloma to a specific graft material. Gelfoam was the most common graft material reported when a reparative granuloma was encountered, followed by fat, and vertigo was the most frequently reported presenting symptom. Reported operative techniques as well as manifestations, management, and outcome are discussed.

N2  - From 1975 to 1992, a total of 1459 primary stapedoplasty operations (i.e., stapedectomy, stapedotomy with tendon section, and stapedotomy with tendon preservation) were performed in 1323 subjects at the Ear, Nose, and Throat Department of the University of Verona. Pure-tone audiometry was carried out in all subjects who were operated on and who underwent 6-month and 10-year follow-ups. To evaluate the influence of stapedius tendon preservation on functional outcome, we randomly selected subgroups of patients using the three different stapedioplasty techniques and tested them by multiple-frequency tympanometry, psychoacoustic tuning curves, and speech discrimination in noise. Finally, to assess the effect of prosthesis diameter on middle ear transfer function, we used the electrocochleographic technique and examined the threshold and latency of cochlear nerve compound action potentials recorded during surgery from the round window. The results of this study show that the best auditory performance in otosclerotic subjects is achieved by performing a stapedotomy of 0.7 mm diameter, using a 0.6 wire-Teflon piston, and preserving the stapedius tendon.

N2  - Promoting tissue adhesion is of concern in almost all areas of surgery. Human fibrin, thrombin and clotting factor XIII have important roles in the healing of wounds and in scar formation. The gluing material we use is a prefabricated fibrinogen concentrate produced from pooled human blood plasma (Tisseel Kit, Immuno), obtained from plasmapheresis centers in Central Europe and the US. The gluing solution averages 110 mg/ml of coagulable material. On applying a thrombin solution (by dripping it onto the area), fibrinogen coagulated in 8-10 seconds (quick coagulation) or 30-50 seconds (slow coagulation). Fibrin glue is valuable in tissue synthesis and tissue adhesion, particularly where conventional suture methods would be difficult. We summarize results in 53 patients operated on between 1985-1993. The Tisseel tissue adhesive system was used for coating and sealing during tympanoplasty (18 patients), and for closure of perilymphatic fistulas (18), chylous fistulas (2), oral and pharyngeal fistulas (3), cerebrospinal fluid leaks (4), facial nerve injury (1), and in split-thickness skin graft and local skin flap application in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (7). Tissue glue is valuable in tissue repair and local hemostasis, facilitates the surgeon's work and may obviate more complicated surgical procedures.

T1  - Ossiculoplasty with semibiologic and composite prostheses.
A1  - Schuring, A G
Y1  - 1994//
N2  - The Lippy-modified Robinson prosthesis has been used for years in revision stapedectomy and has proved successful in reconstructing the absent lenticular process. When this technique fails, an ossicle cup prosthesis can be used. The ossicle cup and columella have been used for 20 years with continuing success. The advantages of the semibiologic prostheses are as follows: The prosthesis can be sized as each case requires, giving a variable height above the remaining stapes. The prosthesis is designed not to touch the promontory or facial nerve canal. The synthetic portion of the semibiologic prosthesis does not touch the tympanic membrane. An efficient perpendicular action is achieved from the tympanic membrane to the stapes footplate. The prosthesis remains in place during tympanic membrane movement. A stable dynamic joint is provided with the stapes capitulum (ossicle cup). A safe platform is provided that distributes the weight of the assembly prosthesis over the entire stapes footplate (ossicle columella). Although both semibiologic prostheses are used routinely for partial and total ossicular replacement, other troublesome and technically difficult ossicular reconstruction problems can also be solved by the adaptability of the synthetic portion of the prosthesis. Because the synthetic portion of the prosthesis can be modified by notching, shaping, and trimming, the following problems can be overcome: A laterally healed tympanic membrane can be reached by increasing the length of the synthetic shaft. In the absence of the stapes capitulum, the cup is notched in two places (180 degrees apart) to fit the shoulders of the remaining stapes. Remaining crura on the footplate can be bypassed by trimming the synthetic footplate to fit in between the crura. The stapes with a low profile can be utilized by increasing the length of the synthetic shaft. An abnormal stapedial tendon attachment to the stapes capitulum can be overcome with a single notch in the cup. An overhanging facial nerve can usually be bypassed by the narrow design of the ossicle columella. The future of ossiculoplasty will rest more on the solution of ancillary problems than on ossiculoplasty techniques. These troublesome ancillary problems include eustachian tube dysfunction, cholesteatoma control, mucosa regeneration, and fibrosis during the healing process. The self-correcting process of ossiculoplasty is an evolutionary process, and the small surgical steps taken are slowly incorporated into surgical principles. Incorporating a synthetic prosthesis within a natural or synthetic ossicle is a logical and evolutionary step in the science of ossicular reconstruction.

N2  - Tympanoplasty for sinus tympani retraction may result in delayed recurrence of the original problem. This is especially true in children with marginal eustachian tube function. Autogenous tragal cartilage, scored on one surface with perichondrium attached on the other, produces a "natural bend" in the cartilage. When placed in the middle ear, with the scored convex surface facing the promontory, retraction into the sinus tympani can be prevented. This simple, yet effective, surgical technique is outlined.

N2  - Thirteen cholesteatomas, with hearing within 20dB, were operated on from 1985 to 1992. Their mean age was 22.1 years, and the mean follow-up period 1.8 years. Eleven cases were pars flaccid type, and 2 cases pars tensa type. Tympanoplasties were performed by the canal down method (4 cases), the canal up method (3 cases), both transmeatal atticotomy and scutumplasty (4 cases) and both the canal down method and mastoid obliteration (2 cases). Postoperative hearing results of three averaged speech frequencies were within 20dB in 11 cases and between 20 and 30dB in 2 cases. No recurrent cholesteatoma or extrusion of columella occurred during the follow-up period. One of the cases operated on by the canal down method showed postoperative mastoid cavity problems, and one of the cases operated on by the canal up method showed retraction of the pars flaccida. These findings prompted us to operate on cholesteatoma cases with normal hearing and to recommend tympanoplasty with transmeatal atticotomy and scutumplasty.

N2  - Studies by laser-Doppler flowmetry of middle ear microcirculation changes induced by physical and chemical stimuli in the animal have only recently been made. This prospective study, performed in humans, was designed to compare the effects of a postural manoeuvre (headup tilt 30 degrees), hypotension and locally applied vasoconstriction on middle ear blood flow during anaesthesia. Circulatory changes provoked by a headup tilt of 30 degrees, and successive intravenous boluses of potent vasodilators, were compared with circulatory changes provoked by locally applied adrenaline, in ten healthy patients in good physical states undergoing middle ear surgical repair. Heart rate and direct arterial pressure were continuously recorded via a radial artery cannula. Middle ear blood flow was continuously recorded via a laser-Doppler probe placed on the promontorium cavi tympani. Metabolic parameters (partial pressure of O2 and CO2 in arterial blood, pH, arterial lactate concentrations) and arterial concentrations of propofol were measured just before and just after the experiment. Headup tilt did not modify heart rate, mean arterial pressure or middle ear blood flow. Vasodilators (nicardipine, nitroprusside, nitroglycerin) provoked a fall in arterial pressure (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001, P < 0.019, respectively), but did not induce any significant variations in heart rate; variations occurred in middle ear blood flow (P > 0.05, not significant) which were different according to patients and agents. Locally applied adrenaline provoked a fall in the middle ear blood flow (P < 0.0012), with no effect on heart rate and arterial pressure. There were no significant changes in metabolic values, or propofol serum concentrations.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

N2  - Since the introduction of stapedectomy with reconstruction of the ossicular chain to Great Britain, many modifications in practice have taken place. The changes include patient selection, operative technique and the type of prosthesis used, as well as the number of operations performed yearly. The aim of this study is to attempt to establish the actual practice among British otolaryngology consultants by means of a simple questionnaire. Two hundred (50.3%) forms were analysed anonymously. The study confirms the decrease in the number of operations performed annually, the absence of centralization for this type of surgery in Great Britain and also demonstrated the trends towards stapedotomy and the practice of bilateral surgery amongst younger consultants.

N2  - The effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patients. Twenty-four patients were anaesthetized for middle-ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane (hypotensive group). Seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control group. The mean arterial pressure was 77 +/- 2 mmHg (10.3 +/- 0.3 kPa) before hypotension and 50 +/- 0 mmHg (6.7 +/- 0.0 kPa) during hypotension in the hypotensive group, and 86 +/- 2 mmHg (11.5 +/- 0.3 kPa) during anaesthesia in the control group. The following psychological tests were performed: four subtests of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (similarities, digit span, vocabulary and digit symbol), Trail-Making tests A and B, Zung tests (self-rating anxiety scale and self-rating depression scale) and two-part memory test battery with immediate and delayed recall. The tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days postoperatively. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative value. The results indicate that hypotension induced by labetalol with isoflurane has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia.

T1  - Hearing results with clothespin ossiculoplasty: preliminary report on the Kraus Modified Schuring Ossicle-Cup Prosthesis (Clothespin Prosthesis).

N2  - The clothespin partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) is designed to increase joint stability during incus replacement ossiculoplasty. Fundamental modifications have been made in the Schuring ossicle-cup, which include a forked well, increased well wall thickness and length, and a flexible tip disk added to the shaft. The forked well functions like a straight clothespin rather than an inverted cup. The forked well enables the clothespin prothesis to slide down over the stapes superstructure, between the facial nerve canal and the promontory, to form a stable, mortise-and-tenon prosthesis-stapedial joint. Joint stability is enhanced because the inferior tine of the forked well is able to lever against the inferior surface of the stapes superstructure, creating a counterforce to gravity. This is in contrast to the more unstable ball-and-socket joint created by most partial ossicular replacement prostheses when they articulate with the stapes capitulum. The addition of a flexible disk to the shaft tip produces a tight, stable union between the prosthesis and the ossicular cap by increasing resistance at the shaft-ossicle interface. Fluoroplastic composition maximizes intraoperative versatility and reliability while the ossicle cap minimizes extrusions. One-year hearing results for twelve chronic ear patients with mobile stapes undergoing clothespin ossiculoplasty during intact canal wall tympanomastoidectomy revealed postoperative air-bone gaps within 20 dB in 92% of cases. The mean postoperative air-bone gap was 8.9 dB, and the mean improvement in air-bone gap was 14.4 dB.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

N2  - Autologous fibrin tissue adhesive is currently the most promising adhesive for otologic use with respect to strength and biocompatibility without the risk of transmissable disease that is of concern with the commercially prepared fibrin adhesive. We set out to evaluate the practicality of preparing autologous fibrin adhesive in cats and to see if the adhesive's duration and strength of bonding was sufficient to allow natural tissue union to occur with various grafting materials. Autologous fibrin adhesive was prepared preoperatively from ten cats using the ammonium sulfate precipitation technique. Twenty otologic procedures were performed in which the incus long process was resected and the defect bridged with one of four grafting materials: autograft ossicular bone, bone pate-fibrin glue, porous hydroxylapatite, and Plastipore-bone pate. All grafts were secured with the autologous adhesive. The cats were sacrificed at 6 and 12 weeks. We found the the autologous adhesive provided adequate duration and strength of support to enable a firm tissue union between all the grafting materials and the adjoining incus and stapes.

N2  - The management of chronic ear disease affecting the only hearing ear is a controversial subject. The relative scarcity of literature on the subject prompted us to prepare a questionnaire which was sent to European and American otologists and to review 19 cases operated at the ENT Clinic of the University of Parma, Italy, and 16 cases operated at The Baptist Memorial Hospital, Memphis, U.S.A. Surgery of cholesteatoma involving the only hearing ear is advised by all the interviewed otologists without exception, even in the presence of a labyrinthine fistula. The cases from the University of Parma were managed as follows: a classic modified radical mastoidectomy was performed in 10 cases, a staged intact canal wall tympanoplasty was done in four cases, an open tympanoplasty in three and a radical mastoidectomy in the remaining two cases. The cases from The Baptist Memorial Hospital were managed with an intact canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) in nine and with an open procedure in seven cases. All the otologists interviewed agreed that surgery of the only hearing ear requires particular attention and experience, and should be performed with extreme care by a very experienced surgeon.

N2  - A patient with "far-advanced" otosclerosis with a profound bilateral hearing loss was evaluated for cochlear reserve using transtympanic electrocochleography (ECoG) and promontory stimulation. Results indicated that both ECoG and promontory responses were present, indicating that cochlear function was present bilaterally. A stapedectomy resulted in closure of the air-bone gap. Postoperative hearing yielded excellent aided responses compared to no measurable preoperative hearing aid benefit. This case serves to demonstrate the value of evaluating cochlear function using these electrophysiologic techniques.

T1  - Autograft tragal and conchal palisade cartilage and perichondrium in tympanomastoid reconstruction.
A1  - Heermann, J
Y1  - 1992//
N2  - Since Utech's introduction of cartilage as a columella in ear surgery in 1969, we have used tragal and conchal autografts for reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and the auditory canal wall in 13,000 cases. As large pieces of cartilage can twist in later years, we place palisaded cartilage fragments with perichondrium parallel to the manubrium of the malleus in type I tympanoplasties and in type II or III procedures parallel to the long process of the incus. The "annulus-stapes plate" in type III tympanoplasties replaces the function of the incus (and malleus), crossing the promontory and reducing adhesions. A "tunnelplasty" keeps the eustachian tube entrance open with the semiring of cartilage ("simmering") apposed to the inside of the annulus, reconstructing the tympanomeatal niche. The "architrave" created rests on the tensor tympani while the palisaded epitympanum and antrum plasty allows ventilation of the antrum. Mastoid obliteration is performed with an autogenous perichondrial transplant to which the palisaded incised cartilage portions adhere, adapting to the underlying structure.

N2  - Silastic sheeting is used to restore a mucosally lined middle ear space and to prevent mucosal adhesions between the medial surface of the tympanic membrane and the promontory after surgical procedures involving the removal of middle ear mucosa. To determine the long-term (1.2 to 21.2 years) effects of Silastic sheeting in the middle ear, six temporal bones from patients with permanent Silastic sheeting in the middle ear cavity after single-stage tympanoplasty were examined. In all six bones, no histologic evidence of foreign body reaction, rejection, or chronic inflammation in the middle ear surrounding the silicone sheeting was observed. Furthermore, the middle ear space was lined by normal-appearing, continuous middle ear mucosa. In four temporal bones, there was no evidence of significant submucosal fibrosis. In two bones, significant submucosal fibrosis was attributable to concurrent middle ear disease rather than to the presence of the silicone. It is concluded that Silastic sheeting in the middle ear after single-stage procedures may prevent adhesions between mucosal surfaces. Given eustachian tube function, Silastic promotes a mucosally lined, aerated middle ear cavity without apparent foreign body reaction, rejection, or chronic inflammatory response.

N2  - Numerous techniques exist for the reconstruction of the ossicular chain. Selection and methods of utilization of the various methods are described. Our preference has been either autograft or allograft ossicular transposition. Analysis of causes for failure and methods to correct them are studied. Difficulties in availability, the risk of transmission of viral diseases, the possibility of long term osseous resorption and practical considerations have led us to use synthetic materials. Hydroxylapatite seems at present to offer the most promising perspectives.

N2  - Conventional hearing aids have improved significantly in recent years; however, amplification of sound within the external auditory canal creates a number of intrinsic problems, including acoustic feedback and the need for a tight ear mold to increase usable gain. Nonacoustic alternatives which could obviate these encumbrances have not become practical due to inefficient coupling (piezoelectric techniques) or unfeasible power requirements (electromagnetic techniques). Recent technical advances, however, prompted a major clinical investigation of a new electromagnetic, semi-implantable hearing device. This study presents the details of clinical phase I, in which an electromagnetic driver was coupled with a target magnet temporarily affixed onto the lateral surface of the malleus of six hearing aid users with sensorineural losses. The results indicate that the electromagnetic hearing device provides sufficient gain and output characteristics to benefit individuals with sensorineural hearing loss. Significant improvements compared to conventional hearing aids were noted in pure-tone testing and, to a lesser degree, in speech discrimination. Subjective responses were quite favorable, indicating that the electromagnetic hearing device 1. produces no acoustic feedback; 2. works well in noisy environments; and 3. provides a more quiet, natural sound than patients' conventional hearing aids. These favorable results led to phase II of the project, in which patients with surgically amendable mixed hearing losses were implanted with the target magnet incorporated within a hydroxyapatite ossicular prosthesis. The results of this second-stage investigation were also encouraging and will be reported separately.

Pinch grafts (multiple small grafts of the epidermal layer) were transplanted in 20 patients, soon after the mastoid cavities were covered with healthy granulation tissue in a mean of 28.5 days after the initial surgery. The grafts adapted well in 18 of the 20 patients. Epidermization was complete in a mean of 11.1 days after grafting, that is, within 40 days after the initial ear surgery. On the other hand, epidermization in 10 cases without grafting was completed in a mean of 83.3 days after the ear surgery. Thus, the pinch grafts reduced healing time by more than 40 days. The secondary application of pinch grafting was beneficial for healing of exposed mastoid cavities caused by use of the open technique tympanoplasty or radical mastoidectomy.

N2  - Several investigators reported metabolic acidosis during ATP-induced hypotensive anesthesia. To elucidate the etiology, we studied blood biochemistry during hypotensive anesthesia for tympanoplastic surgery. The blood concentration of lactic acid, uric acid, phosphoric acid and carbonic acid increased and their total amount coincided with the base excess change. We also found that metabolic intermediates of glycolysis and of the catabolic pathway of adenosine also increased proportionally. The result suggests that the metabolic change is caused by lactic acid produced from glycolysis promoted by ATP and by the catabolic products of administered ATP itself.

N2  - Various studies showed an increase of anxiety and agitation after premedication with thalamonal. Subject of the present study was to specify if the psychotropic effect of the neuroleptic drug dehydrobenzperidol given during surgery is also evident during the postoperative period. Patients undergoing tympanoplastic surgery under general anaesthesia were examined by means of a psychometric analogous self judgement scale seven hours following surgical intervention. Sleep behaviour during the first postoperative night was evaluated via a question sheet. The results show that changes in condition, known from the thalamonal discussion, e.g. increase of agitation, irritability, anxious depression -- also occur during the postoperative period. During the first postoperative night, sleep was greatly disturbed. The results of a comparison group who received the benzodiazepine dipotassium clorazepate instead of dehydrobenzperidol showed a better postoperative condition and sleep behaviour.

N2  - Clinical characteristics of 99 consecutive patients with acquired and perioperatively established aural cholesteatoma were compared with those of 81 patients with chronic otitis without cholesteatoma (controls). The patients answered a questionnaire, and preoperative and perioperative clinical observations were recorded. There were no presenting symptoms or clinical signs that significantly distinguished the cholesteatoma patients. However, these patients had a significantly higher incidence (45%) of previous middle ear surgery than the control patients (30%). The cholesteatomas were not evident until the time of surgical exploration in as many as 38% of cases. Therefore, surgical exploration appears to be the safest way to identify middle ear cholesteatoma.

Y1  - 1991//
N2  - Surgical technics for bypassing ankylosis of the stapes in the management of otosclerosis gradually evolved; modifications were prompted by problems which were revealed by the ongoing audits carried out by earlier surgeons. Auditing of performance must remain an integral part of any otologist's work. The natural history of otosclerosis should be taken into account so that a patient may be fully informed of treatment alternatives available. Stapedectomy will remain a most effective operation which can be recommended with confidence, provided the surgeon has acquired the skill to perform it properly. It is now accepted that many ear, nose and throat surgeons are neither physically nor temperamentally capable of this task and should not perform stapedectomy.

N2  - For patients with a totally empty middle ear a total alloplastic middle ear prosthesis (TAM) has been developed consisting of a macroporous hydroxyapatite canal-wall segment as a foundation system from which a dense hydroxyapatite ossicular chain is suspended. To connect the ossicular chain, we developed an alloplastic tympanic membrane made from a polymer. Light microscopy, morphometry, and autoradiography as well as various electron microscopy techniques were used in this study to evaluate the biocompatibility of Polyactive, a polyether polyester copolymer, after implantation in the rat middle ear. After between 2 and 4 weeks, implants were completely covered by tympanic-membrane epidermis and epithelium. Polyactive provoked a mild foreign-body reaction, showed a degradation rate of 54 percent after 1 year, and was nontoxic. Growth of fibrous tissue and bone into Polyactive copolymer indicated appropriate implant fixation by mechanical interlocking. The fixation of Polyactive by ingrowth of bone is promising, not only in terms of the amount of bone but also in terms of the bone/polymer interface. The latter is indicative of bonding osteogenesis in a way similar to that reported for hydroxyapatite implants. The results of this study showed that Polyactive copolymer is suitable as a degradable alloplastic tympanic membrane, both as a temporary scaffolding for the repair of tympanic membrane perforations and as a tympanic membrane in the TAM.

N2  - Otologic cases are dwindling in numbers, jeopardizing the clinical training of our residents. A survey was performed to determine the magnitude of the problem facing our training programs. Seventy-three of 79 questionnaires distributed were returned. Results of the survey indicate that facial nerve decompression, exostosis repair, and stapedectomy were, on the average, infrequently performed by residents. Training for these seldom-performed procedures consists of temporal bone laboratory experience, close operative supervision, and the use of private patients for resident training. The majority (84%) of respondents did not feel that fellowship training was required to perform otologic surgery on graduation or that it should be required for obtaining hospital privileges in seldom-performed cases. Approximately three quarters (76%) of the program directors consider the training of seldom-performed procedures to be a moderate-to-serious problem facing otologic training today.

N2  - From 1.1. 1983 to 31.3. 1983 we used lyophilised allogenic costal cartilage as reconstruction material in middle ear surgery in 53 patients. Reconstructions of the posterior bony canal wall were performed in cholesteatoma surgery in 89% of the cases. Lyophilised cartilage was also used for the restoration of a traumatic defect in the posterior bony canal wall, for the reconstruction of an atretic ear and an old radical cavity, for closing of a bony defect in the roof of the mastoid, and shaping a cartilaginous columella, or modiolus. Lyophilised cartilage fulfills its function completely in 87% of the cases. 5 reconstructions of the posterior bony canal wall were moderately sunk in. The ears were however dry and free of an inflammation. Both the ear canal and the drum were easy to survey. In 2 cases of a recurrent cholesteatoma, the lyophilised cartilage was extensively destroyed. There were no problems, such as incompatibility, host-versus graft reaction, infection or distortion of the cartilage. With regard to our results, we recommend lyophilised allogenic costal cartilage as reconstruction material in circumscribed defects of the bony ear canal and in bony defects of the skull base of the ear, if larger and thicker pieces of cartilage, as can obtained from the patient's ear, are necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

This review highlights the characteristics and embryologic basis of the malformation. The clinical evaluation of an infant with recurrent meningitis is outlined, and the importance of brain-stem response audiometry and thin-cut computed tomography of the temporal bones is discussed. Surgical management depends on the functional status of the dysplastic ear; usually, a stapedectomy is performed and the vestibule is obliterated. Although the surgical failure rate is 30% after one procedure, early identification of the dysplasia and prompt surgical management diminish morbidity and mortality and permit early habilitation of the child with congenital hearing impairment.

N2  - Intraoperative auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were monitored in 3 patients undergoing middle ear surgery for congenital ossicular anomalies. It was investigated whether this technique was capable of providing useful information to the operating surgeon. After the induction of anaesthesia and intubation, standard disc electrodes were attached to the vertex (active), ipsilateral mastoid (reference), and forehead (ground). These electrodes were draped out of the surgical field. The general anaesthesia was maintained by inhalation of enflurane. Stimulus intensity was decreased from 80 dBnHL in 10 dB steps until no response was obtained. Thus latency-intensity functions for wave V of ABR were obtained. First (A) recording was performed before the incision. The tympanomeatal flap was then elevated and the bony annulus overloading the oval window was drilled out. This enabled to visualize and confirm the anomalies of the ossicles. Before reconstructing the ossicles, the tympanomeatal flap was returned to its normal position and second (B) recording was obtained. During the reconstruction, recordings (C1, C2,...) were repeated as indicated. Then it was confirmed whether the effective reconstruction was obtained for auditory function. The results suggest that latency of wave V was significantly decreased when the effective reconstruction of the ossicular chain was done. Latency-intensity function is shifted to the left of A and B functions. Intraoperative auditory assessment using ABR in the reconstructive surgery for the ossicular channel is promising in providing useful information for auditory function and in predicting postoperative hearing improvement.

T1  - How and when to prescribe sodium fluoride.
A1  - Shambaugh, G E Jr
Y1  - 1989//
N2  - Sodium fluoride has now been used for 24 years in an effort to slow down or arrest sensorineural hearing nerve deterioration in patients with stapedial otosclerosis or after stapedectomy, as well as in patients with pure cochlear otosclerosis. Extensive clinical experience in thousands of patients with this therapy has demonstrated its value in arresting previously progressive sensorineural hearing loss. For a long time there were those who objected to this therapy on the basis that it had not been adequately proven by double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. They have been answered by Bretlau's study in Denmark and Fisch's from Switzerland; both investigators confirmed on small groups the value of sodium fluoride by double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. Extensive research by Professor Petrovic of Strasbourg while at our tissue culture laboratory at Northwestern University demonstrated the action of sodium fluoride on bone. A nicely designed study with radioactive strontium by Linthicum, House, and Althaus demonstrated its value in promoting maturation of a spongiotic focus. Today there is no reason to hesitate in prescribing this useful, effective, and safe medication to promote maturation of otospongiotic lesions, and thus to slow down or to arrest progression in sensorineural hearing loss.

T1  - Deflation opening pressure of the eustachian tube.
A1  - Cohen, D
Y1  - 1989//
N2  - Measurements derived from tests of the performance of the eustachian tube (ET) under a variety of normal and pathologic conditions are widely diffuse and overlap considerably. In this survey, the deflation opening pressure (DOP) of the ET was tested in 31 patients suffering either from recurrent otitis (these patients had ventilating tubes inserted) or from chronic otitis media. Oxygen was deflated from the external ear canal, through the middle ear to the pharyngeal end of the ET. The DOP was the pressure needed for the passing of the oxygen. This pressure was usually between 100 to 200 mm H2O. No difference was found in the DOP between infants and adults or between discharging ears and dry ones. A second measurement was obtained through measuring the deflation flow pressure (DFP) required for the continuous passage of oxygen through the ET. The DFP was less than the DOP by approximately 20 to 60 mm H2O, and again no difference was noted between age groups or between infected and noninfected ears. It was concluded that DOP and DFP measurements of the ET are similar in a variety of conditions and therefore cannot indicate whether the ET is normally or abnormally functioning. The existence of a linear connection between the health of the ET and its performance is not proven; hence the role of the ET in predicting the likely outcome of tympanoplasty should be assessed within a different context.

N2  - Recent advances in otologic microsurgery have brought progress in the improvement of hearing impairment, alleviation of vertigo, and removal of skull base tumors. Refinement of stapedectomy techniques, use of new biocompatible prostheses, and other advances promise improved results with established otologic procedures. In addition, implantable hearing aids and cochlear implants will increasingly improve hearing in patients who previously could not be helped. The surgical methods for vestibular nerve section continue to be refined to help the surgeon and minimize risk to the patient. The challenging new field of skull base surgery has been opened through the combined efforts of otologists and other specialists. The recent advances in these fields are reviewed.

N2  - The actual "early" improvement of hearing thresholds following stapedectomy were measured in 100 patients with otospongiosis by use of direct (intraoperative promontory bone stimulation) and conventional bone conduction audiometry prior to surgery. The direct bone conduction technique was usually more predictive in hearing improvement following stapedectomy than conventional bone conduction audiometry. The direct bone conduction seems to be a superior method for assessing hearing in patients with severe otospongiosis compared with conventional bone conduction which does not reflect actual cochlear reserve.

N2  - 43 cases of large labyrinthic fistulas caused by a cholesteatoma of the middle ear were studied (33 External Semi-circular Canal fistulas, 4 External Semi-circular Canal amputations with opening of the vestibule, 3 of the promontory, 2 of the oval window, 1 of the Semi-circular Canal). The audiometric, preoperative, radiological data was analyzed. The radiological exam is often disappointing for the average-sized fistulas. Preoperative labyrinthization is moderate for External Semi-circular Canal fistulas and even for certain vestibular amputations; it is often incomplete in the other locations. Systematic exeresis of the cholesteatoma matrix is recommended by the authors, at least for the External Semi-circular Canal fistulas as it is not generally accompanied by aggravation of the bony curve. In the other locations, surprising auditory preservations were observed. In conclusion, the presence of External Semi-circular Canal fistulas should not be a counter-indication for carrying out a ossiculoplasty.

N2  - The conventional bone conduction audiometry does not allow an objective assessment of hearing in patients with otospongiosis. We evaluated a new method of direct bone conduction audiometry with the stimulator applied to the promontory intraoperatively. A comparison of conventional and direct bone conduction audiometry thresholds was made in 100 patients in various stages of otospongiosis before stapedectomy. A significant correlation between hearing thresholds obtained by both methods was observed for all frequencies tested (500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz). The direct bone conduction method was at least 30 dB more sensitive for all frequencies. Interestingly, the average direct bone conduction threshold curve did not exhibit a Carhart notch at 2000 Hz compared to the conventional method. We concluded that our bone conduction technique enabled a better assessment of cochlear reserve in patients with otospongiosis.

N2  - A wide variety of anomalies of the middle and inner ear has been reported in association with congenital deafness in Klippel-Feil syndrome. Findings of six new exploratory tympanotomies are added to a review of 14 previously reported; for this entire group, better hearing was achieved in eight ears. When the only anomaly is a disconnection of the incudostapedial joint, good results can be expected from reconstruction of the ossicular chain. With the addition of the six newly reported stapedectomies, the success rate for this procedure now equals 50%. None of the fenestrations of the promontory performed for absence of the stapes and oval window have been successful. Since these results are encouraging, it is concluded that an exploratory tympanotomy should be considered during the course of hearing rehabilitation in cases of Klippel-Feil syndrome and a significant conductive hearing loss. Anomalies of inner ear structures established preoperatively may be a contraindication for stapedectomy.

N2  - Amongst the various sites for stimulation of the internal ear, in monocanal-extra-cochlear system, the fenestra ovale has virtually never been used. The authors suggest a cup-shaped electrode placed at the end of an incudo-vestibular prosthesis, such as a teflon piston, after stapedectomy and interposition of connective tissue. The immediate advantage of such a method is the fixation of the electrode. Tolerance is excellent and electrical impedance remained stable at very satisfactory levels. The future perspective appearing most promising is based upon simultaneous use of electrical and acoustic stimulation.

N2  - Results of myringoplasty or tympanoplasty were evaluated in 225 ears followed for at least one year after surgery. Repair of the tympanic membrane with an underlay connective tissue graft (fascia in 90%) was successful in 97% of the ears. One late perforation developed 3 years postoperatively. The average postoperative air-bone gap was 4.8 dB in 88 cases of myringoplasty, the series including three ears with a rigid footplate. Rigid incus and malleus should not be mobilized but subjected to resection and reconstruction. Poor tubal function caused adhesive changes in one ear (1%). In tympanoplasty the average postoperative air-bone gap was 11.3 dB in 100 ears with stapes present and 20.6 dB in 36 ears with only the footplate remaining. Of the 137 tympanoplasty ears, 10 (7%) showed prominent adhesive changes. In 36 ears with cholesteatoma there was one recurrence 3 years later (3%). An air-bone gap of less than 20 dB was postoperatively noted in 94% of the ears undergoing myringoplasty and in 69% of the ears undergoing tympanoplasty.

N2  - 28 tympanoplastic procedures with destruction and reconstruction of the ossicular chain were performed in rabbits. Vitreous carbon implants were used as prosthetic material. The animals were followed up from 14 days to one year. In 23 cases extensive inflammation of the middle ear mucosa was observed macroscopically. The histological findings were formation of an increasing fibrous capsule with duration of time, permanent foreign body reaction at the surface of the implants and missing formation of new bone or contact with bone respectively. Thus vitreous carbon seems to be a less promising material in middle ear surgery.

N2  - Recently, a new form of porous high density polyethylene (Polycel) has been promoted for use in ossicular chain reconstruction. However, we have found no reports of investigation of the fate of this material used for this purpose in either animals or man. This study was undertaken to look at the tissue tolerance and fate of Polycel in the middle ear of gerbils before its extensive use in humans. We present the light and transmission electromicroscopic findings from these prostheses, removed from the middle ear between 1 and 5 months post-implantation. The results are similar to those found with Plastipore, showing a strong foreign body reaction and the likelihood of phagocytic consumption. As with the other porous plastics, we have reservations about the use of Polycel for ossicular reconstruction.

N2  - Macroporous hydroxyapatite was implanted submucosally in the rat middle ear and studied after intratympanic injection of a Staphylococcus aureus suspension. The middle ear infection was induced 1 week after the implantation, and the effects of infection on the middle ear and the implant material were evaluated after 1, 3, 7, and 14 days by light and electron microscopy. The findings in the infected middle ear with an implant corresponded well with those described for the infected middle ear cavity without an implant. The reactions of the tissue over the implant were similar to those of the original mucosa of the middle ear. Bone was deposited on the implant and in its pores in relatively large quantities. Biodegradation, due at least partially to phagocytic activity of macrophages and multinucleated cells, was more prominent than previously found. This higher degree of biodegradation may be attributed to the use of the mucosal implantation technique, because this was the only point of divergence with respect to material or methods from earlier work reported by our group. The present results, together with those published earlier, suggest that this material has promising features for use as a bone substitute in reconstructive middle ear surgery. Definitive conclusions on biological performance and biofunctionality will, however, have to await long term clinical trials.

N2  - The aim of this study was to obtain more information about macropore tissue ingrowth into the pores of sintered hydroxyapatite implanted in the rat middle ear, for the assessment of the usefulness of this material in reconstructive middle-ear surgery. The exudate filing the pores during the early post-operative period was gradually replaced by equal amounts of fibrous tissue and bone. The percentage of the macropore area occupied by bone was directly correlated with the macropore size. Bone was deposited not only from the pore wall towards the pore centre, but also in the opposite direction. Bonding osteogenesis was demonstrated. At sites of mechanical irritation, the presence of multinucleated cells and proliferatively active mononuclear phagocytes persisted for as long as a year. Under appropriate conditions hydroxyapatite seems to be a promising material for bone substitution in reconstructive middle-ear surgery.

N2  - The clinical and general histopathologic manifestations of systemic vasculitis of the polyarteritis nodosa type are well known. Although hearing loss associated with polyarteritis nodosa has been reported, only two temporal bone studies are available. The findings in a 60-year-old man with well-documented hearing loss who had rheumatoid arthritis, polyarteritis nodosa, and otosclerosis are presented. Polyarteritis nodosa extensively involved the subarcuate arteries and arteries of the facial canal. There were decreased nerve fibers to and sensory cells in the crista of the semicircular canals and macula of the utricle and saccule. Focal and diffuse atrophy of the stria vascularis and decreased cellularity in the spiral prominence and ligament were present. There was a loss of outer hair cells. Otosclerosis involved the left and right oval window niches (bilateral stapedectomy had been performed). There was a small Antoni type A neuroma of the superior division of the vestibular nerve on the left.

N2  - Seven different types of widely used metallic stapedectomy prostheses were individually placed on a millimeter scale in a plastic Petri dish. The Petri dish was moved within the core and around the magnet of a 1.5-tesla magnetic resonance imaging unit (General Electric Sigma). No movement of any of the prostheses was seen. We conclude that there is no apparent danger of these prostheses becoming displaced in stapedectomy patients subjected to the electromagnetic fields of magnetic resonance imaging units.

N2  - Small-fenestra stapedotomy has recently been popularized in efforts to reduce the incidence of sensorineural hearing loss following stapes surgery for otospongiosis. Lasers have been advocated as a tool to fenestrate the stapes footplate. Conversion of radiant energy from the laser into heat in the vestibule represents the greatest potential risk to the inner ear. Using a carbon dioxide laser with a focal point of 150 microns at 300 mm, fenestrations of the stapes footplate were performed in a series of 14 anesthetized cats. The laser power output ranged from 0.47 to 3.05 W, with pulse durations of 0.2 and 0.5 s. Resultant temperature elevations in the vestibule, measured by a thin-wire thermocouple, ranged from 0 to 4.4 degrees C (0 to 8 degrees F) and directly correlated to wattage and duration of the laser-beam pulse. Temperature changes could be reduced by use of lower wattage, shorter pulse duration, timed intervals between pulses, and convection cooling of the promontory.

N2  - The number of new patients with otosclerosis seen by the average otolaryngologist has declined over the past several years. As a result, a controversy has arisen regarding the ability to train residents adequately in the technique of stapedectomy. In this regard, we have analyzed 44 consecutive stapedectomies performed by senior residents, under direct faculty supervision, at the University of California, San Francisco. All procedures were total stapedectomies, performed under local anesthesia, utilizing either wire-vein or wire-perichondrium technique. Four of the ears required footplate or promontory drilling. Closure to within 10 dB of the preoperative bone conduction, averaged over the speech frequencies of 500, 1000, and 2000 Hz, was achieved in 75% of ears, and closure to within 20 dB in 93% of ears. In no patient was hearing made worse. While there were no permanent complications, self-limited problems occurred in 9% of the procedures. Despite a declining caseload of otosclerotic ears in residency programs, it is possible to train residents safely in stapes surgery, given a program of consistent technique and close faculty supervision.

N2  - We evaluated and compared the separate effects of ethyl, isobutyl, and fluoroalkyl cyanoacrylate on the promontory mucosa and surgically disarticulated incudostapedial joint in the adult cat middle ear. The animals were sacrificed at 10-, 30-, and 60-day intervals after glue application. All three cyanoacrylates elicited a chronic inflammatory response when placed directly on the promontory mucosa. The use of ethyl and isobutyl cyanoacrylate resulted in persisting discontinuity of the incudostapedial joint with erosion of the incus. Fluoroalkyl cyanoacrylate maintained incudostapedial continuity without ossicular erosion. Ethyl and isobutyl cyanoacrylate are probably not appropriate for middle ear surgery. The less toxic fluoroalkyl cyanoacrylate may be useful as an ossicular adhesive in selected cases. Our findings are further contrasted with those obtained in similar studies with methyl and butyl cyanoacrylate. The effects of each of the five cyanoacrylates are reviewed in the continuing search for a safe and effective ossicular adhesive.

N2  - The biocompatibility of a new tissue adhesive was tested. Its major advantages are adhesions, hemostasis, and the promotion of wound healing. In experimental surgery on 43 middle ears of chinchillas, documented by histological evidence obtained 45 days after operation, the validity of the following two hypotheses was established. That fibrin tissue adhesive placed upon the footplate of the stapes is biologically compatible, biodegradable and does not cause toxic, inflammatory or foreign body reactions, or other tissue damage to middle ear structures. That a small piece of bone glued on the long process of the incus with fibrin tissue adhesive shows permanent tissue union. In addition, in cases where the inner ear was accidentally opened by surgically subluxating the stapes and adhesive was free to enter the vestibule, evidence was obtained that there was no damage to inner ear structures. This finding deserves further investigation.

T1  - Residual perforations after tympanoplasty: office technique for closure.
A1  - Derlacki, E L
Y1  - 1982//
N2  - The author and his associates still strongly recommend an office closure treatment for central tympanic membrane perforations, which has resulted in 1449 healed perforations over a period of 36 years. A particularly gratifying segment of the healed perforation population has been the 247 residual or recurrent perforations following myringoplasty or tympanoplasty surgery that were closed by office treatment. Thus, the patients were spared a second operation. After reviewing his own and his associates' surgical failures, the author found two factors that seem to predispose to surgical failure. Primary failures or recurrent perforations following surgical repair occur most frequently in patients with neglected or inadequately treated upper respiratory tract allergy. There also appears to be a higher incidence of primary failure or recurrent perforations when an operative approach does not provide an excellent view of the anterior annulus during surgery. This would seem to be the case with the routine use of the transcanal or endomeatal approach. Furthermore, the author also objects to the routine use of a combined endomeatal and postauricular approach, which may permit an unobstructed view of the anterior annular region by tilting the patient away from the surgeon during surgery. If there is a prominent anterior bony canal wall bulge, and there is an anterior graft failure or recurrence, reoperation, rather than a few office treatments, is the only recourse. The visualization problems both during and following surgery as described have led the author to continue his use of the endaural approach and meatoplasty learned during years of fenestration surgery and to adhere to the surgical technique described.

N2  - The long-term results with large fenestra stapedectomy with vein graft and Teflon piston are compared with results with the small fenestra stapedectomy with teflon piston directly into the vestibule. There were 1,943 operations in the former group and 2,155 in the latter when compared in 1970. One hundred consecutive patients from the beginning of each group with follow-up to present were compared. Results were generally the same with no great change in 15 and 20 years as compared to those at 5 years. The complication of perilymph fistula was caused by creating an opening in the footplate much larger than the prosthesis and was eliminated by interposing a living oval window seal if the opening was much larger than the prosthesis and a flap of lining membrane from the promontory when it was not. Other factors that influence a good result are discussed, including the type and the diameter of the piston used, the type of living oval window seal and the method of attachment to the incus. The small fenestra operation was found to be superior to the large, not only for the hearing gain achieved, but the case of performance and the freedom from complications due to migration of the prosthesis and/or the oval window seal. At present we have done about all that can be done for the conductive components. What remains is the sensorineural component which our studies indicate may be due to an autoimmune response.

N2  - While numerous histological findings point towards a possible destruction of inner-ear structures by the Argon-Laser we still miss a satisfactory statement concerning functional impact of stapedectomy or stapedotomy using laser beams. To investigate this we irradiated the promontorium of each of 10 guinea-pigs with laser powers between 0.6 W and 2.2 W ten times for 0.5 s. Then, and on the first, fifth and tenth postoperative day we recorded the brainstem potential evoked by bone-conducted clicks. We found that after the application of laser power up to 1.2 W a reversible threshold shift of up to 20 dB took place. Above powers of 1.2 W a permanent threshold shift was found (Fig. 1). Before sacrificing the animals we recorded the course of temperature in the perilymph during laser irradiation (Fig. 2 and 3). In order to set application limits of power within we consider laser impact functionally critical we compared the temperature increment during single shots and permanent elevation of the temperature above body temperature with values we have found earlier at the human petrous bone (Fig. 2 and 3). This led us to the conclusion that the temperature increment during the shot might be the limiting factor as far as the deterioration of inner-ear function is concerned. This may very well coincide with our hypothesis (Thoma and coworkers, 1981) that the vaporization of endocochlear fluid during the shot is a possible cause of cochlear malfunction after stapedectomy by laser.

T1  - Ceramic implants in otologic surgery.
A1  - Plester, D

Y1  - 1981//
N2  - We have examined the suitability of ceramic materials for reconstruction in middle ear surgery. The excellent tolerance of bio-inert aluminum oxide ceramic implanted into the middle ear has been shown by our electron microscopic studies and clinical experience. Our implants developed for ossicular chain reconstruction were covered by a delicate middle ear mucous membrane within a few weeks. We have observed no foreign body reactions. The ceramic prostheses are distinguished by the almost unlimited number of forms or shapes into which they can be ground quickly and precisely during the operation. We value Al2O3 ceramic implants because there is no bony fixation with the surrounding bone, but rather a jointlike connection with the remaining parts of the ossicular chain. The composition of resorbable tricalcium phosphate, bio-active ceramic, corresponds to the inorganic component of bone. Because it exhibits the characteristic of being replaced by autogenous bone, we consider it for the obliteration of mastoid cavities. Based on our preliminary experience, dense tricalcium phosphate ceramic might play a valuable role in the reconstruction of the posterior auditory canal wall. In addition, we have used dense tricalcium phosphate ceramic to correct minor ossicular chain defects (for example, erosion of the long process of the incus). A survey is given concerning the indications and techniques for the use of these new materials in middle ear surgery, as well as our results covering a period of three years, which are very encouraging as far compatibility and function are concerned.

N2  - The very incidence of postoperative sepsis in tympanoplasty operations on ears with infected cholesteatoma prompted the development of a new technique to improve the control of local infection. An irrigation tube is placed into the mastoid antrum at the time of operation, through which the ear is irrigated in the postoperative period with an antibiotic solution. In 25 tympanomastoidectomy operations, only 6 patients developed postoperative sepsis, 5 of which were due to faulty administration of the antibiotic. In 13 tympanoplasty operations, 6 patients had an unsuccessful outcome. Four of these were due to poor patient selection. Systemic antibiotics are given immediately preoperatively, and continued in the postoperative period until the course has been completed.

N2  - A total alloplastic middle ear prosthesis (TAM), composed of a spongy substance consisting of Teflon and pyrolytic graphite is presented. This prosthesis allows a safe eradication of the diseased tissue and approximates a physiological reconstruction of the sound conducting system. The results obtained in three patients with this TAM up to an observation period of more than two years are promising.

N2  - The transmission of sound to the internal ear passes across the tympanic membrane to vibrate the ossicle chain formed by the malleus, incus and stapes. Movements of the stapes footplate set up complex wave formation within the cochlear fluids to excite the sensory nerve endings of the organ of Corti. Microsurgery for the relief of middle ear deafness has been progressively developed since 1946 and is concerned with the restoration of this collection of sound by an intact flexible ear drum and transmission of oscillation across the middle ear by a free, mobile chain of ossicles. Otosclerosis is a deafness of genetic origin caused by bony overgrowth immobilizing the stapes footplate and is treated with a 95% success rate by selective stapedectomy and fenestration of the footplate. A prosthesis or one limb of the stapes is attached on to the incus and inserted into the fenestration, often with the use of using a tissue graft as a sealing membrane. Over twenty years' experience has originated many differing contours and materials for the stapes prosthesis--in scale some 4 mm or 5 mm in length and 0.3 mm to 0.8 mm in diameter--which will be illustrated and discussed. These prostheses lie deep within a healthy tympanic cavity, and it is most exceptional for a prosthesis to detach or extrude. In our large series subsequent reexploration usually reveals a prosthesis sheathed in mucosa without visible foreign body reaction.

N2  - A 26-year-old woman with bilateral otosclerosis underwent right stapedectomy with an excellent result. One year later, however, she developed symptoms of mumps and within two days was completely deaf in the right ear. Prompt surgical exploration excluded a complication of the otosclerosis and a perilymph fistula, but culture of a sample of perilymph grew mumps virus. The case provides direct evidence of a relation between mumps virus infection and inner-ear damage.

N2  - The authors present two unusual operative findings during surgery for stapedo-vestibular ankylosis, of which no similar cases would appear to be found in the literature. The first case posed the problem of stapedo-vestibular ankylosis as a sequel of clinically latent otitis, the only manifestations of which were radiological opacity of the mastoid and an area of osteitis of the promontory, still active, in the absence of any other progressive inflammatory phenomena or sequelae. Surgery required curettage and opening of the promontory, associated with total stapedectomy and a Teflon-inter-position. The functional result was very good. The second case of typical bilateral stapedo-vestibular ankylosis suggested the possibility of "malignant" otospongiosis, or at all events, markedly progressive. Surgery led to opening of the labyrinth. After platinectomy and excision of a bony sequestrum, there remained only a large fossa with an area equivalent to 3 times that of a usual fenestra ovale. A Teflon-interposition piston was performed with a good result. These rare forms lead to discussion of:--Lobstein's disease, Paget's disease and parathyroid osteosis. Finally, the authors approach the problem of the therapeutic attitude to be adopted in the presence of such rare conditions.

N2  - Histological studies were made of 16 temporal bones of 13 subjects who had stapedectomy operations. Photographs of the prostheses in situ are a special feature of the studies. It was found that prostheses which overlap the margins of the oval window cause incomplete closure of the air-bone gaps. Fibrous adhesions were a common consequence of trauma to the mucous membrane of the middle ear. Gelfoam implantation promotes the formation of thin oval window membranes which tend to bulge out of the oval window. Most incudes show small areas of cortical bone resorption. In at least half the cases the surgical technique of stapedectomy, as judged from these studies, was less than ideal. Surgeons who perform stapedectomy should be cognizant of the relevant surgical pathology and adopt methods which will optimize functional results and minimize complications.

N2  - The incidence of cholesteatoma recurrence using intact canal tympanoplasty has been compared in 2 series of operations. The first group represents cases treated with the conventional conservative technique for attic and middle ear surgery. The second group represents cases on which the concept of 'radical attic and middle ear surgery' has been applied and an en bloc homograft has been used for reconstruction. A preliminary survey has shown a much lower incidence of cholesteatoma recurrence in ears belonging to the second group. The advantages of this surgical technique are discussed.

N2  - With the exception of stapes prostheses, previous use of implantable alloplastic materials in reconstructing the sound conducting mechanism in middle ear surgery has been uniformly unsuccessful. A new material composed of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene has been developed as a replacement for middle ear ossicles. This implant, called the Plastipore total ossicular replacement prosthesis (TORP), and the Plastipore drum to the stapes prosthesis were inserted in 87 patients, all of whom had a long history of extensive middle ear disease and/or surgery. One TORP patient was lost to follow-up. The overall average hearing gain was 14.8 db. The overall follow-up was 12.4 months with a range of from 3 to 25 months. Eleven of the 15 patients receiving the drum-to-stapes prosthesis had hearing gain; 55 of 71 patients receiving the TORP had hearing gain. Eight prostheses were extruded. Nine patients had no improvement in hearing. Eight patients had subsequent decrease in hearing after initial gains. All ears are now dry and aerated. Early evaluation appears to demonstrate that the Plastipore prosthesis shows promise for use in difficult reconstructive middle ear problems.

N2  - Anatomical and hearing results following the use of the homograft tympanic membrane and ossicles either in combination or separately are reported for the period 1968 through 1975. The study is divided into two parts, the first covering the primary years 1968 through 1971, and the latter covering the last four years, 1972 through 1975. The original technique was to cover completely the homograft tympanic membrane with a canal skin graft. During the year 1969 new and different techniques were attempted. Unfortunately this resulted in a marked increase of graft failures; therefore, there was a prompt return to the original technique, which has been used without change throughout the study. The graft take rate for the first four years which included 1969 was 92%. There was a slight increase to 96% during the second part of the study. The hearing results show a greater discrepancy for the two periods with 89% of the patients receiving a satisfactory hearing result during the last four years, compared to 77% for the earlier period.

N2  - Reconstituted bovine collagen is an incomplete protein; it will not support bacterial growth and causes minimal local reaction. It has been used in numerous experiments on animals throughout the phylogenetic scale. With these facts, tympanoplasty was performed on 63 persons. Five years of follow-up indicate acceptable tympanic membrane repair with eight failures.

N2  - Closed tympanoplasty techniques greatly increase the risk of recurrent cholesteatoma. This is obvious as many surgeons using these methods insist on a necessary obligatory control operation as a "second look". In this paper cholesteatomata are classified according to their tendency to extend within the petrous pyramid and the subsequent danger of invading semicircular canals, cochlea or cranial fossae. The predisposition to this type of growth is present in the well defined "medial" type of epitympanic cholesteatoma, and more in the anteriorly than the posteriorly placed ones. As infection becomes less prominent in countries with advanced medical services, especially otology, the cholesteatoma hidden behind a small dry epitympanic perforation and those even with no perforation termed "hidden primary cholesteatoma" become more frequent. They cause their own special symptomatology, not infrequently a slowly progressive facial palsy. Every cholesteatoma requires mandatory prophylactic surgery. This means the complete exposure of the danger area, the epitympanum, and nowadays the possibility of the syncronous complete reconstruction of a normal middle ear and external canal, i.e. osteoplastic epitympanotomy.

N2  - A study of the space available for an ossicular prosthesis is presented. Twelve temporal bones without any signs of chronic ear disease were used. The measurements were made with the bone free from soft tissue mounted on a microscope cross-table. The different distances were registered through a stereo-microscope. The width between the facial nerve canal and the promotory was found to be 2.2 mm. The distance from the footplate to the tympanic sulcus plane was found to be 6.6 mm. The space available for the head of a prosthesis was also investigated.

N2  - Bacterial meningitis remains a life-threatening infection even in the present antibiotic era; thus, any abnormality which predisposes a patient to a recurrence of this serious disease, must be identified and corrected. This report describes the histroy of a 12-year old boy with a profound neurosensory hearing loss, a related absence of vestibular function and a Mondini-type of temporal bone dysplasia who developed recurrent episodes of meningitis which were due to an idiopathic cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea. Even though the meningitis was labyrinthogenic in origin, the patient did not experience the associated symptoms of hearing loss and/or vertigo since the affected inner ear was clinically unreactive. By surgically exploring the middle ear, the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea was confirmed. The leak was observed to be coming from a defect in the stapes footplate, and it was controlled by firmly packing the inner ear vestibule with muscle. A remarkable similarity exists between the patient described above and the 15 previously reported cases of meningitis due to a spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid otorrhea. Generally, the problem occurred in young children, the average age being 6.4 years; male and female were equally afflicted. All 15 previously reported cases had a severe neurosensory hearing loss which was unilateral in 10 individuals and bilateral in the other five. In 11 of the case reports, the vestibular function was evaluated, and the labyrinth was noted to be unreactive in the affected ear. An associated congenital abnormality of the inner ear was described in 11 of the patients reviewed. Anatomically, in 13 cases, the leak was observed to be coming from the oval window area. Other affected sites included one report of a fissure of the promontory and one report of a defect in the roof of the eustachian tube. Multiple surgical procedures were required in 11 of the 15 patients in order to identify the exact source of the otorrhea and to seal it permanently. In three cases, the successful procedure was a middle ear exploration with stapedectomy and packing of the inner ear vestibule. Overall, a total of 36 operations was performed in the 15 patients reviewed. In conclusion, when the physician is confronted by a case of meningitis in a patient with a unilateral or bilateral total loss of hearing and vestibular function, the possible presence of an idiopathic cerebrospinal fluid leak should be considered, expecially if radiographic studies demonstrate a temporal bone dysplasia. In these selected cases, if the etiology of the meningitis is obscure, a middle ear exploration should be performed both for diagnostic purposes as a means to ascertain definitely the presence of a leak and for therapeutic purposes to seal it effectively.

N2  - A patient developed acute otitis media, labyrinthitis, and meningitis 16 months after a stapedectomy operation, and 14 similar cases have been collected from the literature. Poststapedectomy otitis media carries an increased risk of labyrinthitis and meningitis and requires prompt antibiotic therapy and regular observation until cured. Should labyrinthitis occur, with or without meningitis, fistula repair must be undertaken as soon as the infection is eliminated. All stapedectomy patients require regular supervision, and must report for urgent treatment if symptoms of otitis media or perilymph fistula occur. Stapedectomy techniques should not employ sharp bevelled prostheses, and autogenous tissue grafts are probably superior to an absorbable gelatin sponge in protecting the inner ear. Eustachian tube problems and recurring or chronic upper-respiratory tract infections can predispose to middle ear infection and are thus contraindications to stapedectomy.

T1  - Tympanic reconstruction. Fifteen year report on tympanoplasty. Part II.
A1  - Smyth, G D
Y1  - 1976//
N2  - This survey was carried out to evaluate techniques in current use for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media. Part I concerns the incidence of cholesteatomatous complications following combined approach tympanoplasty (CAT). Residual and Recurrent cholesteatoma occurred much more frequently than had been expected or reported elsewhere. Although the incidence of Recurrent cholesteatoma has been markedly reduced by technical modifications, Residual cholesteatoma was discovered inadvertently in one out of every seven previously cholesteatomatous ears in which a second operation for ossicular reconstruction was performed. In at least one-third the disease had been left in the epitympanum. Although many cholesteatomatous cysts might lie dormant for years, and possibly never give rise to serious consequences, it can no longer be claimed that CAT provides a satisfactory means of eradicating cholesteatoma unless re-exploration operations were continued until eventually the tubotympanic cleft could be shown free of cholesteatoma.

N2  - A valuable aeration of the middle ear from the Eustachian tube to the aditus ad antrum is realized by the implantation of a one inch long part of the Vena saphena magna. A tube of polyethylene introduced in the ostium of the Eustachian tube maintains the vein in position during 3-4 weeks, the intima of the vein is an empeachment for synechia with the promontorium. By a special incision the deeper tissues of the ear are formed to a pediculated flap. The splitting of this flap enables the formation of a superficial thin flap, which includes the skin of the external auditory conduct. Applicated on the fascia, a consolidated and fixed neotympanon is realized, the deeper, thicker flap is filling the excavation of the bone. The cartilage of the concha is a valuable substitute of the bridge and the posterior wall of the external auditory conduct.

N2  - A 13-year-old boy undergoing tympanoplasty lasting 3 1/2 hours developed serious airway obstruction at the end of surgery leading to permanent brain damage. It appeared that the no. 7 Portex "blue line" endotracheal tube had collapsed under the cuff. This was concluded because deflation of the cuff had promptly relieved the obstruction of the airway. Further support for this conclusion was the finding that shortly after extubation the inflation of 8 ml air caused the tube to collapse. Collapse of these tubes cannot normally be produced unless they have been made to collapse shortly before. Investigation of such tubes in vitro at 37 degrees C showed that overinflation of the cuff caused a symmetrical collapse of the tube wall along the x-ray opaque blue line. The collapse occurred with cuff pressures varying from 310 mmHg up to 460 mmHg for tubes from different batches. During anaesthesia with 66% nitrous oxide, this gas together with carbon dioxide were found to diffuse into the cuff at steady rates of 3.69 vol % and 0.36 vol % per hour, respectively. Corresponding increases in intracuff volumes were found. It is advised that disposable tubes should be carefully inspected before use and that endotracheal cuffs should be deflated periodically during anaesthesia to avoid excessive rise in cuff pressure.

N2  - A comparative study between the monobloc tympano-ossicular implant and the classical columellar technique is made. Although both give satisfactory audiometric results, the follow-up of the columellar restoration showed some post-operative disadvantages, namely: invagination and perforation of the tympanic membrane, slipping of the columella, and fixation of the columella to the tympanic ring (bony annulus) or to the promontory. In view of the normal tympano-malleal fixation, the normal static pressure accomodation in the incudo-malleal joint and the normal topological situation, monobloc implant obviates the disadvantages inherent in the columellar technique. Two aspects of the monobloc implant need further examination; these are the restoration of the correct rotation axes and the incudo-stapedial connection.

N2  - In 78 patients, representing 10% of the most severe case of chronic otitis media and in whom the mucosa from the promontory had been removed or severely damaged, the promontory was covered in one-stage mastoidectomy-tympanoplasty with a large piece of thin silastic or of Gelfilm. The results in the silastic group, comprising 50 patients, and in the Gelfilm group, comprising 28 patients, were compared on the basis of various criteria. The results proved better in the Gelfilm group. In particular, the percentage of recurrent perforations was considerably lower than in the silastic group. In one-stage operations, which we prefer, it is therefore recommended to use Gelfilm rather that silastic.

N2  - An ususual complication after stapedectomy for otosclerosis is reported. After two vain attempts elsewhere, the tympanic cavity was opened for the third time. Since the incus was missing, a malleovestibuloplasty was undertaken, using the Schuknecht wire prosthesis. Hearing was very good. One day after the operation, a facial paralysis developed, and increased over the following days. After 18 days, the nerve was found to be oedematous and swollen above the fenestra ovale upto the level of the promontory and had forced the prosthesis out of the fenestra ovale. Six weeks later, nerve function was normal.
