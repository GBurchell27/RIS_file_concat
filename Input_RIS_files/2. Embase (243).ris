N2  - Objectives: Although various stapedotomy and stapedectomy techniques exist, anchoring the piston can be challenging. We present a novel surgical approach for treating congenital stapes malformations with an atypical facial nerve trajectory. Methods: This is a case of a 7-year-old boy presenting with bilateral conductive hearing loss. Prior attempts at tympanoplasty had proven unsuccessful in improving his hearing. Presurgical imaging studies revealed an unusual anatomical configuration, with the facial nerve positioned inferior to the oval window. This anatomical variation precluded the use of conventional prosthesis-anchoring techniques typically employed in stapedotomies. Thus, we devised an innovative approach, opting to anchor the prosthesis to the short process of the incus. Results: This novel technique circumvented the atypical course of the facial nerve, allowing for successful reconstruction of the ossicular chain. The patient demonstrated an acceptable improvement (30 dB gain) in hearing 1-year post-surgery, with no reported complications. Conclusion: This case underscores the critical importance of adapting surgical techniques to address the unique anatomical challenges that may arise in the context of congenital ear malformations. It also highlights the potential of the short process of the incus as a viable alternative anchoring site for stapes prostheses, thereby improving the outcomes of such complex cases. This technique not only restored the patient's hearing but also contributed valuable insights into the management of similar cases, potentially improving the quality of life for individuals with rare and challenging anatomical variations. Level of evidence: 5.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether degree of asymmetric hearing impairment influences patient-reported outcome measures and objective hearing results in primary stapedotomy. STUDY DESIGN: Register study. SETTING: Data from the Swedish Quality Register for Otosclerosis Surgery consisting of 90% of stapes operations performed in Sweden. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The 984 patients eligible for inclusion were categorized on the basis of preoperative hearing impairment: unilateral, bilateral asymmetric, or bilateral symmetric. Pure-tone audiometry and patient-reported outcome measures were analyzed, and Glasgow benefit plots were constructed. Ordinal logistics regression analyses were performed to adjust for factors influencing PROMs associated with degree of asymmetric hearing. RESULTS: Over 90% of patients across all groups reported improved or much improved hearing ability post-surgery. Ninety-five percent of patients who rated their hearing as worse or much worse after surgery had an air-conductive gain of <20 dB PTA4. Individuals with unilateral hearing impairment were more likely to report lower satisfaction with hearing function and daily life activities after surgery compared with those with bilateral hearing impairment, especially bilateral symmetric hearing impairment. In terms of hearing function, the bilateral symmetric hearing impairment group showed a significant decrease in the log odds of reporting lower satisfaction with a coefficient of -0.71 (95% confidence interval, -1.13 to -0.33), whereas the bilateral asymmetric hearing impairment group showed a nonsignificant decrease with a coefficient of -0.14 (95% confidence interval, -0.41 to 0.14) compared with the unilateral hearing impairment group. Tinnitus was more frequent in those with unilateral hearing impairment. CONCLUSION: Those with preoperative unilateral hearing impairment were more likely to express lower satisfaction with the results, compared with patients with bilateral impairment. Our findings suggest that the degree of bilateral hearing impairment should be considered in preoperative counseling, to better align with patient expectations regarding the benefit of surgery. An estimated air-conductive gain of at least 20 dB PTA4 was favorable for patient satisfaction.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate taste disorders after middle ear surgery, their modifying factors especially chorda tympani nerve injury or underlying otologic disease. We investigated consequences of taste disorders on quality of life. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: Monocentric study in tertiary care center. Methods: A total of 214 patients who underwent middle ear surgery were included. Data regarding taste disorders were collected by questionnaires over a 1-year follow-up period. Results: Taste disorders were reported in 42.7% at 10 days, in 23.3% at 4 months, and in 9.2% 1 year postoperatively. When the chorda tympani nerve was initially healthy, taste disorders were more frequent after its transection throughout the follow-up period. When it was involved in a cholesteatoma or inflammatory process, postoperative taste disorders were more frequent after nerve stretching. Postoperative discomfort in daily life was rated on the Likert scale at 3.5 out of 10. Dietary modifications were reported by 25.8% of patients, and mood alterations by 15% of patients. Conclusion: Taste disorders are frequent after middle ear surgery although they mostly improve in the first months. When the CTN is healthy, cutting it leads to more taste disorders than stretching it, thus advocating its preservation to prevent these symptoms. However, in cases of pathological CTN, cutting this nerve, which is sometimes necessary to control the disease, is less likely to cause taste disorders than stretching it. These taste disorders are a source of discomfort and may present risks of dietary modifications and emotional impact.

N2  - Background: Endoscopic ear surgery has numerous benefits, such as the capacity to obtain high-resolution pictures and visualize normally inaccessible locations such as the retrotympanum, sinus tympani, and facial recess. These areas are generally difficult to access with traditional microscopic techniques. Endoscopic ear surgery reduces operating time when performed by skilled surgeons, without the need for a postauricular incision wound. An essential aspect to consider when evaluating the effects of any procedure on individual satisfaction is the assessment of health-associated quality of life. It is a tool used for subjective assessment, which is regarded as a reliable measure of the satisfaction perceived—whether physically or mentally—resulting from a certain procedure. The goal of this study was to identify the benefits of middle ear surgery when done endoscopically compared to postauricular microscopic techniques in middle ear surgery. This was achieved by evaluating and comparing the level of satisfaction among patients who underwent either microscopic or endoscopic ear surgery. Methods: The Chronic Ear Surgery Survey (CESS), a 13-point Likert scale survey designed specifically for assessing outcomes of surgery for chronic middle ear disease, was implemented to measure patient satisfaction. The survey comprises three subscales. We performed a retrospective study at the Otorhinolaryngology Department, Cairo University, Egypt. The study encompassed individuals who underwent surgery on the middle ear between March 2018 and September 2021. The patients were scheduled into two categories according to the technique of surgery (whether endoscopic or microscopic) in order to assess postoperative satisfaction using the Chronic Ear Surgery Survey (CESS). Results: Our research findings demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the two categories in terms of the overall scores and all subscale scores of the Chronic Ear Surgery Survey (CESS), with patients who had middle ear surgery endoscopically (EES) showing better outcomes. Conclusions: Identifying the elements that are strongly associated with subjective outcomes can assist surgeons in identifying patients who are more likely to have poorer satisfaction. This knowledge can be valuable in preoperative counseling. Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) seems to have a higher level of cosmetic acceptability, especially in terms of enhancing the socially related aspects of a patient's pleasure. This work thus supports the ongoing integration of endoscope utilization in otological surgical procedures.

N2  - Purpose: This study aimed to conduct a comparative analysis of audiological and postoperative clinical outcomes between the endoscopic and microscopic stapedotomy approaches. Methods: This study employed a randomized, controlled design. Twenty-seven patients with bilateral otosclerosis underwent stapedotomy in both ears, with randomized allocation of the surgical technique (endoscopic vs. microscopic) for the first operated ear. Air-bone gap (ABG) and ABG gain were measured at least 12 months postoperatively. Postoperative outcomes including pain (Visual Analog Scale-VAS), dizziness, early-term (day 1) and late-term (6 months) dysgeusia were evaluated. The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) assessed health-related quality of life at one month postoperatively, and operative time was measured. Results: This study compared endoscopic (n = 27 ears) and microscopic (n = 27 ears) stapedotomy for otosclerosis. Both groups achieved similar hearing improvement with no significant differences in pre-operative and post-operative bone/air conduction thresholds, ABG, and ABG gain (all p > 0.05). The endoscopic stapedotomy group demonstrated reduced postoperative pain (lower VAS scores, p < 0.001), lower early dysgeusia (3.7% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.005), shorter operative time (47.3 vs. 75.4 min, p < 0.001) and improved patient-reported outcomes (higher GBI score, p = 0.014) when compared to microscopic stapedotomy group. No significant differences were observed in postoperative dizziness or late-term dysgeusia between groups. Conclusion: This study found similar hearing improvement with both endoscopic and microscopic stapedotomy for otosclerosis. However, the endoscopic approach showed advantages in reduced postoperative pain, early dysgeusia, and operative time, with improved patient-reported quality of life. These findings suggest endoscopic stapedotomy as a valuable alternative to the conventional microscopic approach.

N2  - Current therapeutic options for hearing loss rely on hearing aids, ossiculoplasty or cochlear implants. These devices have limitations, particularly in noisy acoustic environments. Therefore, interest in exploring aetiological treatments to improve not only auditory perception but also the quality of life of those affected is increasing. Gene therapy is a promising aetiological treatment that can fully restore auditory function. The success of gene therapy relies on the efficient delivery of therapeutic genes or genetic modifications to the cells of the inner ear that are designed to repair or replace defective genes and restore normal hearing function. Two main strategies for gene therapy involve the use of recombinant viral vectors and nonviral delivery vehicles. Owing to their excellent diffusion properties and compatibility with sensory cells, recombinant viral vectors, particularly adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), have dominated gene therapy in the cochlea. However, recombinant viral vectors have several drawbacks, such as limited transgene size, immunogenicity (particularly in neonates), and potential need for repeat administration. Nonviral vectors, such as cationic lipids and polymeric nanoparticles, are potential attractive alternatives. Nonviral vectors have several advantages, including low immunogenicity and unlimited transgene size. Recent studies have demonstrated significant auditory recovery in vivo using nonviral vectors in murine models. However, nonviral vectors are not as efficient as viral vectors in transferring genetic material. An alternative to nanoparticles is the use of other methods, such as electroporation. The main advantage of electroporation is that it can be used in combination with cochlear implantation and can target surface cells, but this method has a risk of cell damage. The goal of this review is to provide valuable insights into the current state of research on nonviral vectors for inner ear gene therapy and propose the exploration of innovative and effective gene therapy strategies for the treatment of hearing loss.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to establish the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) and assess the responsiveness of the Chinese version of Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21-Chn). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective multicenter study. SETTING: Four Chinese tertiary referral centers admitting patients nationwide. PATIENTS: 230 adult patients with chronic otitis media (COM) undergoing tympanoplasty. INTERVENTION: Patients were required to complete the ZCMEI-21-Chn to measure health-related quality of life both preoperatively and postoperatively. An anchor-based method was used to determine the MCID of the derivative cohort by including the Global Rating of Change Questionnaire as an anchor. The generalizability and consistency with functional outcomes of the MCID estimates were externally examined in a validation cohort using a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. RESULTS: A total of 161 and 69 patients were included in the derivative and validation cohort. The mean preoperative and postoperative ZCMEI-21-Chn total scores were 28.4 (standard deviation [SD] 14.5) and 17.5 (SD 12.6). The mean change in ZCMEI-21-Chn score was 10.9 (SD 14.3, p < 0.001). The MCIDs of the ZCMEI-21-Chn for improvement and deterioration were estimated at 13 (SD 13.0) and -7 (SD 12.9), accordingly. For patients who have reported an improved health-related quality of life, a cutoff value of 15.6 dB HL for elevation of the air-conducted hearing threshold was noticed. However, change of clinical importance judged according to MCID and Japan Otological Society criteria disagreed with each other, notably with a Cohen's kappa ( κ ) of 0.14 ( p = 0.21) in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: This study is the first to establish the MCID of a COM-specific questionnaire in Chinese. For the COM population undergoing surgical intervention, MCID values of 13 for improvement and -7 for deterioration are recommended. The results were externally validated to be generalizable to nationwide usage, yet distinguishable from the audiological criteria. The availability of the MCID greatly adds to the clinical utility of the ZCMEI-21-Chn by enabling a clinically meaningful interpretation of its score changes.

N2  - Middle ear neuroendocrine tumors (MeNETs) are an exceptionally rare occurrence. These benign tumors stem from the tympanic mucosa and can easily be misinterpreted by the clinician and the pathologist. Clinical characteristics, otoscopic findings and medical imaging in these cases are non-specific. We present a case of a 60-year-old male patient with bilateral hearing loss following recent coronavirus disease 2019 disease. Diagnostic work-up revealed a soft tissue neoplasm of the left middle ear. Surgical resection of the tumor mass with implantation of a partial ossicular replacement prosthesis (PORP) was the main modality of treatment. Middle ear neuroendocrine tumors was confirmed through positive immunohistochemistry for neuroendocrine tumor markers. Follow-up magnetic resonance imaging 12 months after the surgery reported no tumor recurrence or significant residual disease with a stable PORP. Our report highlights challenges in diagnosing and treating these rare tumors, while emphasizing surgical resection pitfalls and resulting improvement of quality of life of the patient. We recommend a through followup of patients with unclear soft tissue masses in the middle ear to obtain a definitive diagnosis.

N2  - Otosclerosis is a well-known disease which mainly affects middle-aged female patients, causing conductive or mixed hearing loss. Diagnosis is essentially made through a complete audiometric battery testing, while treatment substantially relies on stapes surgery. In this study, we analyzed audiometric and Quality-of-Life data from 33 patients in order to refine the surgical indications (unilateral versus bilateral stapes surgery) and assess the best technique (stapedotomy versus partial stapedectomy) and timing of treatment. The original questionnaire OTOS, in the Italian language, was administered to all patients. In this study, most of the patients were female (18/33), with a mean age of 53 years old. Both surgical techniques appear to be effective with no significant difference in post-operative Air Bone Gap. OTOS questionnaire appeared to be effective in assessing quality of life in patients treated by stapes surgery. Post-operative QoL appeared to be similar in bilaterally and unilaterally operated patients, suggesting that a contralateral intervention after effective surgery should be undertaken only if expressly requested by the patient.

N2  - The purpose of this study was to examine the quality of life (QoL) and hearing thresholds of patients who underwent 2 types of stapes surgery. A retrospective cohort study was performed comparing stapedotomy with NiTiBOND prostheses (n=20) and stapedectomy with autogenous cortical bone columella (n=20), applying the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) and the Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults outcome measures with hearing thresholds. Univariate comparative statistical methods were applied. The stapedotomy cohort had significantly better values of Social Support Score of the GBI as compared to the stapedectomy cohort (P=.016). No statistically significant difference was detected between the groups in the pre- and postoperative audiological results and the further QoL measures. Apart from the excellent postoperative audiological results of the different types of stapes surgeries, stapedotomy with NiTiBOND prostheses seems to be superior as regards QoL over stapedectomy applying autogenous cortical bone columella.

N2  - Allograft tympanoplasty was once widely used across the world but is currently only performed by a limited number of surgeons in Belgium and Germany. Allograft tympanic membranes and ossicles are procured endoscopically nowadays and are processed in specific tissue banks subject to European Union regulations on human allograft tissue to ensure the receptor will receive quality-controlled tissue. The surgical procedure via retroauricular approach can teach us how we can manage difficult cases with total, subtotal and marginal perforations, but also cases of isolated pars tensa cholesteatoma.

N2  - Objectives: To test the hypothesis that surgical otologic intervention for any type of pediatric hearing loss decreases the odds for incident adverse cognitive and linguistic developmental outcomes. Study design: Retrospective cohort database study. Methods: Electronic medical record data from the TriNetX Research Network were queried for children with congenital, sensorineural, conductive, and mixed hearing loss (HL) between ages 0 and 5 years. Patients were further stratified by presence (HL + surgery) or absence (HL-surgery) of surgical intervention at any point following diagnosis, including cochlear implantation, tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy, and tympanostomy. Primary outcomes were defined as odds for new adverse cognitive or linguistic outcomes at any point given HL treatment status [odds ratio with 95% confidence interval, (OR; 95%CI, p-value)]. Cohorts were balanced using propensity-score matching (PSM) based on US census-defined demographics and clinically relevant congenital conditions. Results: Of 457,636 total patients included in the study, 118,576 underwent surgery (HL + surgery cohort) and 339,060 did not (HL-surgery). In matched cohorts, surgical otologic intervention significantly decreased the odds of developing cognitive disorders including scholastic, motor, psychological developmental disorders, and pervasive developmental delays (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Surgical interventions for treatment of pediatric HL including cochlear implantation, tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy, and tympanostomy should be considered as they may prevent delays in development.

N2  - Introduction: Extracranial meningiomas are an extremely rare entity, accounting for less than 1% of all meningiomas. Involvement of the ear and temporal bone is an even rarer clinical subset, with less than 100 cases reported in the literature and no definitive treatment paradigm recommended. Case Description: We present the case of a 42-year-old female who presented with a chief complaint of 2 years of gradual left sided hearing loss and intermittent acute otitis media. Prior to presentation at our clinic, she had undergone outside evaluation with preliminary diagnosis of cholesteatoma with recommendation of surgical removed. This was delayed and, prior to presentation to our clinic, the patient had noted development of pulsatile tinnitus and dysphagia. Audiometric testing demonstrated evidence of progressive conductive hearing loss. Initial imaging studies revealed a lateral skull base mass involving the left jugular foramen, middle ear and cerebellopontine angle. Differential favored jugulotympanic paraganglioma versus meningioma. Management and Outcome: This patient's case was discussed at our Skull Base Tumor Board and given the potential morbidity of infratemporal fossa approach and a very low probability for complete resection, the decision was made to proceed with left tympanoplasty, middle ear exploration and debulking of the tumor. Intraoperatively, the tumor was noted to be extending to the Eustachian tube orifice, the ossicles, and down to the jugular bulb in the hypotympanum. Pathologic specimen confirmed a WHO Grade I Meningioma. Adjuvant treatment was performed with 54 Gy/30 fraction proton therapy. At last follow-up, she was thirty-seven months post completion of adjuvant therapy with stable disease and resolution of her left sided hearing loss and pulsatile tinnitus. Discussion: We present a rare case and long-term outcomes of an extratemporal meningioma involving the jugular foramen, middle ear and cerebellopontine angle, managed with debulking and proton beam therapy. Choice of treatment in these cases is dictated by proximity to critical structures and, therefore, associated risk of morbidity with total surgical resection. A multimodal treatment approach with tumor debulking and adjuvant particle therapy has been shown in limited numbers to be an effective treatment modality for skull base meningioma with low complication rates and improvements in quality of life. Conclusion: Herein, we present a case of extracranial meningioma involving multiple critical structures of the lateral skull base, which was successfully managed with debulking and adjuvant proton therapy now 3 years following treatment. This adds to the limited body of literature regarding management of this rare presentation, which we plan on expanding to a future case series.

N2  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of CO2 LASER stapedotomy in improving subjective and objective hearing loss in patients with clinical otosclerosis and to assess it advantages over the classical “cold” technique. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study of 40 patients who had undergone LASER stapedotomy following clinical diagnosis of otosclerosis between February 2018 to December 2019.All these patients underwent LASER stapedotomy with prosthesis insertion. Pre and postoperative hearing assessment were done. The audiologic results were assessed in terms of amount of air and bone conduction threshold gains and AB gap closure, intra and postoperative complications if any. Data analysis was done by IBM SPSS Statistics Version 20 and descriptive analysis, Pearson’s correlation and paired t tests were applied. Results: 40 patients underwent LASER stapedotomy from February 2018 to December 2019. There was significant Air Bone Gap closure with more than 10 dB in 77.5%patients and more than 20 dB in 10%. All patients reported subjective improvement in symptoms and quality of life. There were no cases of floating footplate in these cases. In 5 cases of obliterative otosclerosis skeeter drill was used to thin the footplate and LASER was used to make the final stapedotomy hole. In all other cases stapedotomy hole could be made directly without the need to thin the footplate. In 29 patients Teflon piston (Grace Medical Devices) of 0.6 mm diameter was used and in 11 patients Titanium Piston (Kurz Medical Devices) of 0.4 mm diameter was used. The size of stapedotomy hole made by LASER is 0.1mm more than the planned piston diameter size. None of the patients developed any significant post-operative complication. Conclusion: Stapedotomy is an effective surgical treatment for improving hearing outcomes in patients with otosclerosis with marked improvement in quality of life. Majority of patients report clinically improved hearing post procedure. LASER stapedotomy is a safe procedure with lower intra and postoperative complications and hence is recommended for patients requiring surgery.

N2  - Introduction: A bleeding-free surgical field is crucial for middle ear surgery. Impairment of intraoperative visibility due to bleeding is a problem in ear procedures. As a result, controlled hypotension helped to reduce intraoperative bleeding. Controlled hypotension is stated as "reduction in systolic blood pressure to 80 - 90 mmHg, a reduction of mean arterial pressure to 50 - 65 mmHg or a reduction of 30% of baseline mean arterial pressure" In middle ear procedures the main techniques to reduce blood loss were mild head end elevation of 15°, and topical application or infiltration of adrenaline (1: 50,000 and 1: 200,000). A mild head end elevation acts by reducing the venous and arterial pressures in head and neck but in turn increases the chance of air embolism. In case of such hypotension, head end elevation would furthermore compromise vascular supply to head and neck. Out of the several drugs, dexmedetomidine has emerged as one among the most commonly used drugs in anesthetic field, along with routinely used anesthetic drugs. Dexmedetomidine, a highly selective α2 adreno-receptor agonist mediating analgesia and sedation.6 Dexmedetomidine is utilised as an adjunct to general anaesthesia in the preoperative (sedation), intraoperative (analgesia and hemodynamic stability), and postoperative (recovery) phases (no respiratory depression). Major side effects noted following the infusion of dexmedetomidine are hypotension and bradycardia. The elimination half-life of dexmedetomidine is 2 hours and its redistribution half-life is 6 mins, and this short life makes it a ideal drug for intravenous infusions. Hence a study was conducted to assess the effects of dexmedetomidine in lower doses on, hemodynamic parameters like heart rate and blood pressure, bleeding in surgical field. Materials & Methods: A randomized prospective study was conducted after the prior approval by the institutional ethical committee at Alluri Sitarama Raju Academy of Medical Sciences, Eluru, West Godavari District, Andhra Pradesh during the period of November 2019 to October 2021. The sample size at 95% confidence interval with standard deviation of heart rate with conventional procedure at 12.8 beats per minute.10 and expected difference of heart rate of 10 beats per minute was estimated to be 30 per each group. Subjects belonging to American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I and II of both genders, aged 18-60 years, weighing more than 45 kgs, posted for elective middle ear surgery were enrolled for the study. Patients suffering from cardio vascular diseases, hypovolemia, bradycardia, hepatic impairment, diabetes mellitus, mothers who are pregnant and lactating, patients who are on sedatives and hypnotics and patients with dexmedetomidine allergy were excluded. All patients were evaluated one day prior to surgery, during pre-operative evaluation and informed consent was taken. The quality of hypotensive anaesthesia was determined by the operating surgeon based on the blood loss at surgical site. Grade 0 is no bleed, excellent surgical condition, no suction needed. Grade 1 is minimal bleed, sporadic suction needed. Grade 2 is diffuse bleed, needed repeated suction. Grade 3 is bleed is troublesome, needed continuous suction. The neuromuscular blockade was reversed with injections of 0.05 mg/kg neostigmine and 0.008 mg/kg glycopyrollate at end of surgery. After adequate spontaneous breathing efforts and motor recovery, the patient was extubated. Patient later transferred to PACU to be observed for respiratory depression, sedation score, haemodynamic changes, nausea, vomiting or any drug induced adverse effects or complications. Results: The Mean age of subjects in the study was 34.96 ± 9.43 years and in-group B it was 36.23± 12.66 years. The proportion of males and females was 56.6% and 43.3% respectively. Mean body weight of subjects in group A was 64.3 ± 11.8 kgs and in group B it was 65.2 ±9.7 kgs. Regarding ASA grading, 83.3% and 16.4% of patients belonged to ASA grade I and grade II respectively.[Table 1] Though the mean heart rates of group B appeared to be lower than that of group A at various intervals, there was no statistical significant difference in means between the two groups. [Table 2] Similarly, the mean systolic blood pressures recorded at regular interval of time were found to be lesser in group B when compared with group A but there was no statistical significance. [Table 3] Whereas the mean diastolic blood pressures was found to be higher in group B when compared with group A, but there was no statistical significant difference in mean DBP between the two groups.

N2  - Introduction: Cholesteatoma, a challenging entity in otologic surgery, necessitates a standardized classification system for effective communication among healthcare providers and consistent reporting of surgical outcomes. The ChOLE Classification System, introduced by Linder et al., stages cholesteatoma based on extension (Ch), ossicular chain status (O), life-threatening complications (L), and Eustachian tube function and mastoid pneumatization (E). Methods: We classified 199 patients who underwent cholesteatoma surgery between 2019 and 2023 in our University Hospital to assess the distribution of the ChOLE stages and to examine the relationship between the ChOLE stages and the duration of surgery. Results: This study revealed significant correlations between the ChOLE stage and respective subgroups of the classification and duration of surgery and thus complexity of procedure. Conclusion: Despite limitations, the ChOLE classification proves valuable in predicting surgical complexity and optimizing patient care. Further research is warranted to validate these findings and enhance cholesteatoma management strategies.

N2  - Introduction: One-handedness is a challenge in conventional endoscopic ear surgery (EES). We present results on the first-ever application of the passive endoscope holder ‘Endofix exo’ (Co. AKTORmed GmbH, Neutraubling, Germany) in EES, which enables two-handed surgery. Methods: This two-sided study compares cut-suture time, operating time, postoperative complications, graft take rates, hearing results and quality of life in patients who underwent first stage tympanoplasty due to tympanic membrane perforation with intact ossicular chain conditions. 25 patients received classic EES (EES-, mean age: 28 ± 21 years) and 15 received EES with the passive holder (EES+, mean age: 48 ± 21 years). Results: Mean operating times (EES-: 96 ± 38 (SD) min; EES+: 107 ± 33 min), cut-suture times (EES-: 68 ± 30 min; EES+: 73 ± 31 min), complications, graft take rates and hearing results (preoperative air bone gap (ABG) (PTA4): 15 dB ± SD 8 dB (EES-); 16 dB ± SD 8 dB (EES+); postoperative ABG (PTA4): 11.25dB ± SD 11.3dB (EES-); 14 dB ± SD 10 dB (EES+)) did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) between the two groups. Postoperative hearing results and quality of life tended to improve in both groups (p > 0.05). Discussion: The passive endoscope holder has been successfully applied during the course of the study. However, modifications of the endoscope holder and further studies are recommended focusing on positioning of grafts and prostheses to obtain conclusive results regarding the superiority of two-handed EES over one-handed conventional EES.

N2  - Objective. The purpose of this study is to analyze the effect of half canal wall down tympanomastoidectomy(HWD) in the treatment of chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma. Method. In this retrospective study, the HWD technique was used at our hospital for chronic otitis media or cholesteatoma removal in 265 adult patients, representing 271 operated ears, with an average follow-up time of 8.4 years. Results. The postoperative cavities were slightly wider and straighter in 91.9% of the ears. 15% of the patients needed cavity cleaning every 6 months, 25% of them needed cavity cleaning every year and 60% of the patients had a self-cleaning cavity. Only one patient with cleft palate experienced cholesteatoma recurrence in the mesotympanum. Conclusion. The HWD technique showed a low-recurrence rate and satisfying operative cavities. HWD technique is a good choice for middle ear surgery.

N2  - Objective: Primary stapes surgery is considered a challenging intervention in ear surgery. Despite an risk of deafness in 0.5–1 percent, this procedure has still a good benefit-risk ratio due to the improvement in hearing and quality of life that is usually achieved. However, revision after prior stapes surgery is considered even more challenging. Revisions after stapes surgery are very heterogeneous procedures, both in terms of the indication and the surgical strategy and are generally considered to be significantly more demanding. Reasons for complications after prior stapes surgery as well as strategies for successful revisions are not well described in the literature. Methods: Retrospective cohort study, tertiary referral center. 124 cases of revisions after prior stapes surgery were identified between 2011—2022 and are analyzed based on biographic data, clinical, audiological, and intraoperative findings as well as the eventual therapy. Cases were analyzed regarding indication, intraoperative finding and the surgical strategy chosen. Results: Acute, subacute, and long-term complications of the primary intervention as well as other incidental reasons such as progressive hearing loss can be identified as indication for revision surgery. Preoperative clinical findings were correlated to intraoperative findings and surgical strategies. Audiological results are discussed. Conclusions: Different recommendations for the indication of a surgical revision can be derived depending on the individual preoperative case history and findings. In addition, there are patterns regarding the chances of success of a revision, especially in cases of persistent conductive hearing loss chances of hearing improvement seem possible in more than 80% of cases.

N2  - Background: Some preoperative and postoperative audiological outcomes may be associated with quality of life (QoL) in stapedotomy patients. Aims: The aim of this study is to determine which frequencies and conduction pathways improve following this surgery and to assess their effects on QoL. Material and methods: Cases who underwent small fenestra stapedotomy were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative and postoperative pure tone audiometry were evaluated. The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) questionnaire was also administered to assess the impact of the operation on their QoL. The relationship between audiologic results and QoL was also examined. Results: A total of 45 ears from 41 patients were included in the study. There is a statistically significant improvement in postoperative mean air conduction (AC), bone conduction (BC) and air-bone gap (ABG) values compared to preoperative values (p <.001). A significant moderate correlation was found between preoperative mean ABG and GBI scores, and between postoperative improvements in AC thresholds and ABG at all frequencies (500, 1,000, 2,000 and 4,000 Hz) and GBI scores (0.3<r < 0.7, p <.05). Among the postoperative BC thresholds, only the improvement at 2,000 Hz was found to have an effect on the GBI score (r =.309, p =.049). Conclusions and significance: Audiological outcomes following stapedotomy had an impact on QoL. Preoperative ABG can be used as an indicator of postoperative QOL.

N2  - Introduction: Otosclerosis is the primary cause of conductive hearing loss with normal otoscopy. As the condition worsens, certain patients may develop a sensorineural component. Patients with successful surgeries may still need hearing aids, which creates a dilemma for health professionals as there are insufficient data to make informed decisions. This study investigated the influence of the surgeon’s proficiency level, individual patient factors (e.g., age at the time of intervention and survival rates), and surgery costs on the cost-effectiveness of stapes surgery. Methods: We performed a cost-effectiveness analysis using an adapted Markov model incorporating annual all-cause mortalities. In addition, we introduced sensitivity analyses to address the effects of surgical expertise on adults with bilateral conductive hearing loss due to otosclerosis. A model was developed based on a decision tree with treatment options and complication scenarios for otosclerosis patients undergoing stapes surgery or receiving hearing aids. Annual all-cause mortality was considered. A sensitivity analysis was performed assigned to different training levels (“experts” and “less experienced”) to simulate the effects of surgical experience on the cost-effectiveness of surgical outcomes. Successful surgery was defined as closing of the air-bone gap to 10 dB or less. Based on published data, “experts” were simulated with a 93.7% success rate, and “less experienced” were manufactured with a 68.9% success rate. Results: Stapes surgery provides improved quality of life (QoL) compared to hearing aids with lower cumulative costs up to 87 years of age in the case of “expert” surgeons and up to 78 years of age, when performed by “less experienced” surgeons. Conclusions: Primary stapes surgery is highly cost-effective and delivers improved QoL compared to hearing aids with lower cumulative costs. Additionally, undergoing stapes surgical training remains highly cost-effective.

N2  - Purpose: Endoscopic type I tympanoplasty was originally introduced in the 1990s and the extensive spread of this practice can be easily observed. The conventional technique performed involves the repair of a tympanic membrane perforation and is defined as microscopic type I tympanoplasty. The aim of this study is the comparison of quality-of-life (QoL) outcomes with endoscopic to that with microscopic type I tympanoplasty. Methods: All patients, or in the case of children with the aid of a parent, were asked to complete a novel QoL questionnaire drafted by our study group. The analysis was performed with descriptive statistics—mean, SD and relative frequency—and with a mixed model (generalized least squares fit). A two-sided p value of < 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Results: A total of 83 patients completed the questionnaire, 38 in the endoscopic group and 45 in the microscopic group. Every question represented a different. A statistically significant result was found in favor of the endoscopic approach regarding average hospitalization rate (p = 0.003) and cosmetic outcomes (p = 0.015). No statistically significant difference was otherwise observed between the groups. Conclusions: Based on our prospective cohort study, the QoL outcomes of endoscopic type I tympanoplasty in terms of postoperative pain, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, taste disorder and hearing were comparable to the microscopic type I tympanoplasty. In regard to cosmetics, an increase in desirable results was achieved in the endoscopic group, particularly the average hospitalization rate proved to be statistically significantly lower than in the microscopic group.

N2  - Purpose: Hearing rehabilitation through middle ear surgery can be challenging, particularly for patients with chronic otitis media, but new hearing devices offer opportunity to reach this goal. The aim was to compare hearing outcomes and quality of life in patients who were converted from a Baha Attract system to the Osia system. Methods: Prospective observational study, in which each subject acted as their own control. Six patients who were converted from a Baha Attract to an Osia system performed audiometric and quality of life assessments with different sound processor at fitting, 3, 6 and 12 months. The speech performance in noise with the Osia system at 12 months, expressed as dB SNR, was compared to the baseline condition (Baha 5). Results: The PTA4 hearing thresholds improved from 42.6 ± 11 with Baha 5 Power to 34.8 ± 13.3 with Baha 5 SuperPower and to 25.4 ± 3.5 with the Osia at 12 months, leading to a significant functional gain of 17.2 ± 10.9 dB vs Baha 5 (p < 0.02). Speech understanding in both quiet and noise was clinically improved reaching a mean SNR of less than 1 dB at 12 months with the Osia system. Quality of life outcomes improved by more than 20% at 12-month follow-up. Conclusion: Aided hearing thresholds and speech understanding in noise improved when patients were converted from the Baha Attract system to the Osia system. The aided hearing threshold was maintained up to 8 kHz (26 dB) with the Osia system.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the changes in the quality of life of patients who underwent Type 1 tympanoplasty using the Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire 12 (COMQ-12). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Prospectively collected data of patients aged between 18-65 years, who had undergone type 1 tympanoplasty between January 2018 to January 2019 were included in the study. The Turkish version of COMQ-12 was completed by all of the patients preoperatively as well as 12 months postoperatively. Preoperative and postoperative graft uptake outcomes, hearing assessment results, and scores of COMQ-12 were evaluated. Shapiro-Wilk test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Wilcoxon test were used. RESULTS: A total of 98 patients were included. Noticeable improvement in the severity of symptoms, negative effect on daily life and work routine, health care, and general well-being was detected by subjective scores of the questionnaire. The COMQ-12 preoperative and postoperative overall average score was 25 and 7, respectively (p<0.001). Graft uptake success was found to be 85%. Hearing assessment evaluation showed a mean change in air conduction values of 8.78 (SD 1.17), and a mean change in air-bone gap values of 7 (SD 0.8), both showing statistical significance (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: According to the COMQ-12 questionnaire data after surgery, symptom severity, lifestyle and work impact, health service impact, and general discomfort were significantly reduced.

N2  - Objective: To explore whether and how the established socio-demographic parameters pertaining to a lower-middle income nation influence the outcome of cartilage tympanoplasty in children with chronic otitis media (COM), inactive mucosal variety. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, children aged 5–12 years with COM (dry, large/subtotal perforation) were considered for type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty following definite selection criteria. Relevant socio-demographic parameters were noted for each child. These included parents' education (literate/illiterate), living area (slum/village/others), mothers’ occupation (laborer/business/housewife or home-maker), family type (nuclear/joint), and monthly family income. Outcome at 6 months follow-up was interpreted as “success” (favorable; anatomically intact and well-epithelialized neograft and dry ear) and “failure” (unfavorable; residual or recurrent perforation and/or discharging ear). The role of individual socio-demographic factor in determining the outcomes was analyzed with relevant statistical methods. Results: The average age of the 74 children included in the study was 9.30 ± 2.13 years. At six months, 86.5% had a successful outcome, with a statistically significant hearing gain (closure of the air-bone gap) of 17.02 ± 8.96 dB (p = .003). Mothers' education had a significant influence on the success rate (Chi: 4.13; significant at p < .05); children of ∼97% of the literate mothers had a successful outcome. Living area was significantly associated with success (Chi: 13.94; significant at p < .01); ∼90% of children living in the slum areas had success, compared to 50% of those residing in villages. The family type also significantly influenced the surgical outcome (Chi: 3.81; significant at p < .05); ∼97% of the children belonging to the joint families encountered success, compared to ∼81% of those brought up in the nuclear families. The success also depended on the mothers’ occupation (Chi: 6.47; significant at p < .05); ∼97% of the housewife mothers had children who were successful, against ∼77% of mothers engaged as laborers. Another factor significantly associated with success was the monthly household income. Nearly 97% of the children belonging to families with a monthly household income of >3000 (cut-off limit set by the median value) experienced success, in contrast to 79% of those having a monthly family income of <3000 (Chi: 4.83; significant at p < .05). Conclusion: Socio-demographic parameters are valuable determinants of the outcome of surgical management of COM in children. For type 1 cartilage tympanoplasty, mothers’ education and occupation, family type, living area, and monthly family income significantly influenced the surgical outcome.

N2  - The aim of this report is to document a very rare case of Blastomycosis dermatitidis mastoiditis with extension into the retromastoid soft tissue and surrounding muscle. Blastomycosis dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus of endemic areas which classically infiltrates the lungs; however, dissemination presenting as otomastoiditis is exceedingly rare. The patient was an immunocompetent 27-year-old male with no significant preexisting health conditions. He had significant work exposure to dust and soil and was referred to our department for evaluation of otalgia with headaches, hearing loss, and intermittent facial paralysis. Initially, the extent of the infection was unknown. Based on extensive disease on magnetic resonance imaging, the patient was scheduled for urgent tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy. Postoperative treatment with itraconazole resolved any further manifestations and halted further soft tissue invasion. It is important to consider uncommon fungal infections in the workup of persistent otalgia, especially when presenting with facial paralysis and a history of environmental exposure to soil and dust. This type of infection should be considered regardless of immunodeficiency status. Early detection may prevent hearing loss and local invasion into surrounding structures.

N2  - Introduction: Patients with otitis media (OM) encounter significant functional hearing impairment with conductive, or a combined hearing loss and long-term sequelae involving impaired speech/language development in children, reduced academic achievement and irreversible disorders of middle and inner ear requiring a long time therapy and/or multiple surgeries. In its persistent chronic form, Otitis media (COM) can often only be treated by undergoing ear surgery for hearing restoration. The persistent inflammatory reaction plays a major role, often caused by multi-resistant pathogens in the ear. Herein, we present outcomes of patients implanted with currently the only FDA approved active Middle Ear Implant Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB), suffering from persistent COM. Methods: The study enrolled 42 patients, treated by performing middle ear (ME) surgery to different extents and implanted with the VSB to various structures in the ME. Included were 17 children and 25 adults that had recurrent and/or persisting OM and significant hearing loss. Preoperative and postoperative patients' audiometric data were evaluated and the benefit with VSB assessed using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory for adults and pediatric cohorts. The microbial spectrum of pathogens was assessed before and after surgery, exploring the colonization of the otopathogens, as well as the intestinal microbiome from individually burdened patients. Results: The mean functional gain is 29.7 dB HL (range from 10 to 56.2 dB HL) with a significant improvement in speech intelligibility in quiet. Following VSB implantation, no significant differences in coupling were observed at low complication rates. Postoperatively patients showed significantly increased benefit with VSB compared to the untreated situation, including less otorrhea, pain, medical visits, and medication intake, with no recurrent OM and significant bacterial shift in otopathogens. The analysis of the intestinal microbiome displayed a high abundance of bacterial strains that might be linked to chronic and persistent inflammation. Conclusions: Functional ear surgery including rehabilitation with a VSB in patients suffering from COM present to be safe and effective. The successful acceptance accompanied by the improved audiological performance resulted in significant benefit with VSB, with a shift in the ear pathogens and altered microbiome and thus is a great opportunity to be treated.

N2  - Background The chorda tympani nerve (CTN) is a mixed nerve, which carries sensory and parasympathetic fibres. The sensory component supplies the taste sensation of the anterior two-thirds of the ipsilateral side of the tongue. During middle ear surgery the CTN is exposed and frequently stretched or sacrificed, because it lacks a bony covering as it passes through the middle ear. Injury may cause hypogeusia, ageusia or altered taste sensation of the ipsilateral side of the tongue. To date, there is no consensus regarding which type of CTN injury (sacrificing or stretching), during middle ear surgery, leads to the least burden for the patient. Methods A double-blind prospective prognostic association study was designed in a single medical centre in the Netherlands to determine the effect of CTN injury on postoperative taste disturbance and quality of life. 154 patients, who will undergo primary stapes surgery or cochlear implantation will be included. The taste sensation, food preferences and quality of life of these patients will be evaluated preoperatively and at one week, six weeks and six months postoperatively using the Taste Strip Test, Electrogustometry, supplementary questionnaire on taste disturbance, Macronutrient and Taste Preference Ranking Task, Appetite, Hunger and Sensory Perception questionnaire and Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders to assess the association of these outcomes with CTN injury. Evaluation of olfactory function will only take place preoperatively and at one week postoperatively using the Sniffin' Sticks. The patient and outcome assessor are blinded to the presence or absence of CTN injury. Discussion This study is the first to validate and quantify the effect of chorda tympani nerve injury on taste function. The findings of this study may lead to evidence-based proof of the effect of chorda tympani injury on taste function with consequences for surgical strategies.

N2  - Introduction: The main determinant in deciding on stapes surgery in patients with otosclerosis is the degree of hearing loss, specifically the size of the preoperative air-bone gap (ABG). The debate over the minimum ABG centers on the risk-to-benefit ratio of stapes surgery in patients with small ABG (sABG). The aim of this study was to measure the audiological outcomes and self-assessed satisfaction in a group of otosclerosis patients with an sABG who underwent stapedotomy. Methods: There were 83 patients with preoperative sABG ≤25 dB HL (mean of 500, 1,000, 2,000, 4,000 Hz) included in this study. Audiometry was performed before surgery and 6 months and 12-36 months after surgery. Self-reported patient outcomes before and after surgery were collected using questionnaires. Results: At the 6-month follow-up, the ABG was closed within 10 dB in 63 (78.8%) cases. Preoperatively, tinnitus was present in 70% of patients, of which 66% reported that tinnitus was a moderate or severe problem. Postoperatively, 71% of patients experienced a significant reduction in tinnitus severity and 34% of them reported complete disappearance. The self-report outcomes relating to quality of life and hearing reflected a good level of satisfaction in most patients. Conclusion: The possibility of reducing bothersome tinnitus after stapes surgery, and thus improving the patient's quality of life, should be taken into account when making a decision on stapes surgery in these patients.

N2  - Objectives: Access to and utilization of perioperative healthcare may influence outcomes in patients with chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM); however, the influencing factors are poorly understood. The objective of this study was to assess the association of sociodemographic factors with perioperative health care utilization for pediatric CSOM patients. Methods: We conducted a review on pediatric CSOM patients (≤18 years old) who underwent tympanoplasty with/without mastoidectomy between 2010 and 2020. Sociodemographic data and clinical were collected on all participants. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the association between these factors and perioperative care utilization. Results: 427 patients were included in the study. The primary factor associated with health care utilization was insurance status. Rural children were more likely to have Medicaid insurance (p = 0.048). For tympanoplasty patients, Medicaid patients have 1.66 higher odds of pre-operative no-shows (p = 0.01), 1.31 higher odds of post-operative no-shows (p = 0.02), and 59% lower odds of having a postoperative audiogram (p = 0.01), and 2.64 higher odds of being from a rural community (p = 0.02). For patients undergoing mastoidectomy, Medicaid patients have 1.25 higher odds of postoperative no-shows (p = 0.01), 39% lower odds of having a revision procedure for ossicular reconstruction (p = 0.045). Appalachian rural mastoidectomy patients had 3.62 higher odds of having cholesteatoma (p = 0.05). Conclusion: Pediatric patients with CSOM who have Medicaid insurance, especially those who reside in rural regions, are at risk for lower perioperative hearing health care utilization. As these findings may impact care delivery and clinical outcomes, efforts should be focused on promoting utilization among these populations. Level of Evidence: 4 Laryngoscope, 133:700–705, 2023.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the incidence of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) injury between endoscopic and microscopic stapes surgery. Methods: This randomized controlled clinical trial included 88 patients who were randomly divided into two groups: endoscopic stapedotomy group (n = 44) and microscopic stapedotomy group (n = 44). The incidence of chorda tympani nerve (CTN) injury after surgery was determined by both subjective taste testing and chemical taste tests, before and after surgery. The results were compared between the two groups. Results: The total number of patients who were identified as having CTN affection (based on the chemical testing) was 16 out of 88 (18.2%). The incidence was significantly lower in the endoscopic group (n = 2) than the microscopic group (n = 14) (p = 0.019). Conclusion: Altered taste as a result of iatrogenic CTN injury can affect the patients’ quality of life. Endoscopic ear surgery offers better visualization, less need for extensive manipulation of the chorda tympani, and consequently decreased incidence of CTN injury.

N2  - Objective:To summarize the clinical characteristics of elderly patients with chronic suppurative otitis media who underwent type Ⅰ tympanoplasty, and to analyze for the first time the efficacy of type Ⅰtympanoplasty in elderly patients from multiple perspectives of medical data and patient evaluation, so as to provide reference for doctors and patients to make rational decisions on treatment methods. Methods:Forty-four elderly patients（45 ears） who underwent type Ⅰtympanoplasty from May 2016 to February 2022 were retrospectively analyzed, and were followed up for 6 months to 3 years. To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients, summarize the success rate of graft, and compare the hearing level of patients before and after surgery. The patients' quality of life before and after operation was evaluated by Chronic Ear Survey, and the scores obtained were statistically analyzed. Results:Of the 44 patients（45 ears）, 22.22%（10/45） of the ears had predisposing factors. The percentage of hearing loss, ear pus and tinnitus were 91.11%（41/45）, 88.89%（40/45） and 42.22%（19/45）, respectively. Mixed deafness accounted for 55.56%（25/45）. 66.67%（30/45） patients were diagnosed as tympanosclerosis by operation. The graft success rate was 97.78%. There was no significant difference in bone conduction hearing threshold before and after surgery, but there was significant difference in air conduction hearing threshold and air bone conduction difference. The scores of "activity restriction", "symptom", "medical resource utilization" and their total scores of the preoperative and postoperative were statistically different. Hypertension or diabetes had no significant effect on the efficacy of type Ⅰ tympanoplasty in elderly patients. Conclusion:Type Ⅰtympanoplasty is safe and effective in elderly patients, and the quality of life of patients after surgery is significantly improved. It is necessary to increase the awareness of elderly patients to seek medical advice and use surgical methods reasonably to treat chronic suppurative otitis media.

N2  - Objective: Unstable cavities are defined as cavities with cerumen accumulation that need frequent cavity cleaning in the out-patient clinic, cavities that are intolerant to water due to risk of infection or that are subject to frequent infection and otorrhoea. The objective of this study is to address the problem of troublesome mastoid cavities, with the performance of secondary mastoid obliteration and canal wall reconstruction, using a novel posterior auricular artery (PAA) fascia-periosteum flap. Materials and methods: A prospective study was designed, only secondary obliterations were included. Unstable mastoid cavities were defined as Merchant grade 2 or 3 and were included for surgery. Results: At 12 months of follow up, a complete external auditory canal (EAC) and a self-cleaning ear were achieved in all 23 patients. Completely dry ears were achieved in 21 patients (91.3%). An air-bone gap improvement of 5 dB was achieved. Conclusion: Mastoid obliteration and EAC reconstruction are effective procedures to treat troublesome post canal wall down mastoid cavities. They improve quality of life and enable patients to overcome ear discharge. A standard EAC size enables the utilization of conventional hearing aids, it also reduces the need for constant mastoid cleaning and decreases healthcare expenses. The PAA flap seems to be an effective procedure to achieve all these features, as it is used to obliterate the mastoid and becomes a structural component of the neo-EAC.

N2  - Background: The surgical treatment of otosclerosis consists of the replacement of the stapes using a piston. Aims/Objectives: The objective of this study is to assess the audiometric results and quality of life (QOL) of patients who underwent surgery for otosclerosis by stapedectomy with fascia interposition (STIP) or by stapedotomy using CO2 laser (SLaser) without fascia interposition. Material and Methods: Ninety-one patients operated on for otosclerosis by STIP (40 patients) and by SLaser (51 patients) were included. Audiometric results were graphically displayed using the Amsterdam Hearing Evaluation Plot and were compared to the Common Otology Database (COD) comprising 660 patients. The patients’ QOL was assessed with an otological validated survey. The significance level was p <.05. Results: There was no significant difference in hearing improvement between SLaser and STIP-operated patients. There was no significant difference between our results and that of COD. QOL was significantly improved (+3.5/10) postoperatively for both STIP and SLaser in both social and professional fields. Conclusions and Significance: By comparing QOL and hearing gain of STIP and SLaser, our results suggest that both surgical techniques are a safe and successful treatment for otosclerotic stapes fixation. Further studies aiming at comparing larger series may confirm and refine these results.

N2  - Objective: This systematic review aims to describe the impact of otologic surgery as a treatment for chronic otitis media (COM) on the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) of adult patients. Methods: A literature search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science until May 2023. Prospective studies including adult patients with COM (cholesteatoma) who underwent canal wall up mastoidectomy, canal wall down mastoidectomy, or tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy, with pre- and postoperative HRQoL measurements, were considered eligible. Questionnaire validation studies were excluded. The risk of bias and study quality were evaluated with a Quality Assessment Tool (for before-after studies with no control group). To assess the change in HRQoL, pre- and postoperative HRQoL values and absolute changes were extracted, synthesized, and presented in tables. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated to enhance comparisons. Results: Of the 720 studies identified, 16 met the inclusion criteria of this review. Different questionnaires were used throughout the studies. The CES and COMOT-15 were used in five studies and the ZCMEI-21 and COMQ-12 in three studies. All studies indicated statistically significant improvement in HRQoL from pre- to postoperative, measured with disease-specific HRQoL questionnaires. General HRQoL questionnaires did not show significant improvement. Calculated SMDs ranged from 0.24 to 6.99. Discussion and conclusion: Included studies had low (n = 10) to high (n = 6) risk of bias and poor (n = 4), fair (n = 7) or good (n = 5) study quality. Surgical treatment positively impacts the HRQoL of adult COM patients with and without cholesteatoma. However, the clinical relevance of the reported changes is unknown due to the lack of minimal clinically important differences (MCID) or cut-off values in each questionnaire. Therefore, further research regarding the MCIDs of each questionnaire is needed. Future research should also report preoperative chief symptoms and indications for surgery to improve individual patient counseling.

N2  - Background and objectives: The chronic otitis media questionnaire-12 (COMQ-12) and chronic otitis media benefit inventory (COMBI) aim to assess the quality of life related to chronic otitis media or its surgical treatment. The objective of this study was to validate the Spanish adaptation of the COMQ-12 and COMBI. Patients and methods: Multicentre prospective instrument validation study. guidelines for the cross-cultural adaptation process were followed. The psychometric properties of the Spanish versions (“COMQ-12-Spa” for “COMQ-12-Spanish” and “COMBI-Spa” for “COMBI-Spanish”) were assessed in 25 consecutive adults undergoing tympanoplasty and in a separate cohort of 25 unaffected adults. Results: COMQ-12-Spa: test–retest reliability, r = 0.98; internal consistency reliability, α = 0.92. Item-subscale and item-total coefficients, ≥0.40. Between-group discrimination, p < 0.0001. COMBI-Spa: internal consistency, α = 0.96. A high-intensity relationship between the variables was shown, ≥0.40. Correlation between the COMBI-Spa and the Spanish Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), r = 0.89; p < 0.01. Conclusion: Psychometric testing of the Spanish versions of the COMQ-12-Spa and COMBI-Spa yielded satisfactory results, thus allowing pre- and postintervention assessment of the subjective severity of chronic otitis media in adult patients.

N2  - Purpose: Transcutaneous active bone conduction hearing aids represent an alternative approach to middle ear surgery and conventional hearing aids for patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss. The aim of this study was to determine quality of life, subjective hearing experience and patients’ satisfaction after implantation of a bone conduction hearing aid. Methods: This monocentric and retrospective study included twelve adult patients who received a bone conduction hearing aid (Bonebridge, MedEL) consisting of an extracorporeal audio processor and a bone conduction implant (BCI) between 2013 and 2017. On average 40 months after implantation, the patients were asked to answer three questionnaires regarding quality of life (AqoL-8D), self-reported auditory disability (SSQ-12-B) and user’s satisfaction (APSQ) after implantation of the Bonebridge (BB). A descriptive statistical analysis of the questionnaires followed. Results: 12 patients aged 26–85 years (sex: m = 7, w = 5) were recruited. The quality of life of all patients after implantation of the BB (AqoL 8D) averaged an overall utility score of 0.76 (SD ± 0.17). The mean for ‘speech hearing’ in the SSQ-12-B was + 2.43 (SD ± 2.03), + 1.94 (SD ± 1.48) for ‘spatial hearing’ and + 2.28 (SD ± 2.32) for ‘qualities of hearing’. 11 out of 12 patients reported an improvement in their overall hearing. The APSQ score for the subsection ‘wearing comfort’ was 3.50 (SD ± 0.87), ‘social life’ attained a mean of 4.17 (SD ± 1.06). The ‘device inconveniences’ reached 4.02 (SD ± 0.71) and ‘usability’ of the device was measured at 4.23 (SD ± 1.06). The average wearing time of the audio processor in the cohort was 11 h per day, with 8 of 12 patients reporting the maximum length of 12 h per day. Conclusion: BB implantation results in a gain in the perceived quality of life (AqoL 8D). The SSQ-12-B shows an improvement in subjective hearing. According to the APSQ, it can be assumed that the BB audio processor, although in an extracorporeal position, is rated as a useful instrument with positive impact on social life. The majority stated that they had subjectively benefited from BB implantation and that there were no significant physical or sensory limitations after implantation.

N2  - This case study describes a 72-year-old female with a history of stapedectomy 40 years prior. She presented experiencing vertigo, fogginess, and imbalance for 9 months. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed that the prosthesis was displaced into the vestibule by approximately 2.1 to 2.4 mm. The patient was presented with treatment options, including observation, removal, replacement of the prosthesis, and an oval window patch. The patient opted for observation as the symptoms she was experiencing did not significantly impact her quality of life. Although a stapedectomy may fail for a multitude of reasons, some of the most common causes are prosthesis displacement, especially out of the oval window into the middle ear or away from the incus. Incus necrosis may also play a substantial role in failure.

N2  - This systematic review aims to (a) define what instruments are available to measure quality of life (QoL) in patients undergoing tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media (COM) and what is the most commonly selected timing to do so; (b) compare outcomes from different surgical techniques; and (c) describe any reported correlation between subjective and functional results. This review was conducted following the PRISMA statement recommendations. Of the 151 articles screened, 24 were included. Most studies had a prospective design. The mean age at surgery was 44.5 years. A microscopic retroauricular approach was the most common surgical technique. Most articles included both primary and revision surgeries. The most commonly used questionnaire was the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), followed by the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), the Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15) and the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21). Questionnaires were administered about 12 months after surgery in most studies. Ten studies reported possible associations between hearing results and QoL. QoL assessment after COM surgery variably relies on disease-specific and non-specific questionnaires. Patients are usually evaluated 12 months after surgery, and this appears to be a suitable timing to contrast the possible bias effect of different tympanoplasty techniques associated with different healing times. A comparison between QoL outcomes in different surgical approaches cannot be made, as several influencing factors have not been detailed in the included studies. Few studies have investigated the correlation between subjective and objective outcomes of tympanoplasty for COM so far.

N2  - Introduction: Chronic otitis media affects millions of people worldwide. According to the classification by Bluestone and Kenna, non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media is considered the most common part of chronic otitis media, which has tympanic membrane perforation with episodes of intermittent otorrhea and hearing loss of different degrees. The association with conductive hearing loss is well known, however, the relationship with sensorineural hearing loss is still controversial in the literature; some studies show the relationship of this pathology with damage to the inner ear that brings a serious problem in terms of personal quality of life and social impairment. Objective: To evaluate the association of sensorineural loss in patients with unilateral non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media in a tertiary hospital. Methods: Quantitative cross-sectional study, retrospective analysis of data recorded in electronic medical records of patients undergoing unilateral tympanoplasty surgery between 1984 and 2019 at Hospital Governador Celso Ramos, Florianopolis. Results: In 172 patients evaluated, sensorineural hearing loss was found in the ears diagnosed with non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media in 27.9% compared to the contralateral ear. Observed at middle frequencies, 2000 Hz prevalence of 29.1%, that increases directly proportional to the increase in frequencies, reaching 58.7% at 4000 Hz. There was an association with disease duration, perforation size and otorrhea (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Sensorineural hearing loss is associated with non-cholesteatomatous chronic otitis media and, the longer the duration of the disease, the worse the progression which starts in the middle frequencies and becomes even more prevalent in the higher frequencies. Reason for the importance of early surgical treatment. Keywords: Otitis media; Hearing loss; Sensorineural hearing loss.

N2  - The purpose of this Technical Note is to describe the surgical technique to transform canal wall down tympanoplasty into canal wall up tympanoplasty, that is, to rehabilitate a recess cavity by filling the mastoid and epitympanic cavities with synthetic tissue (bioactive glass) and recreating a normal-caliber external auditory canal. Mastoid cavity obliteration leads to a clinically significant improvement in health-related quality of life without increasing risk of recurrent or residual cholesteatoma, conditional upon technically impeccable surgery.

N2  - Objective: To understand the patterns of temporal bone fracture and facial nerve injury from ballistic trauma. Study Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Retrospective review of 42 patients evaluated following temporal bone ballistic injury at a single institution, university-based level-one trauma center between 2012 and 2021. Demographics, facial nerve status, CT images, interventions, complications, and outcomes were reviewed. Results: Mean age 30.3 years (range 5–58 years); 79% male. Racial demographics reflected the surrounding community. Seven mortalities occurred. Nineteen patients (54%) demonstrated facial nerve injury. Of those, 13/19 displayed immediate paralysis, 1 delayed, 5 unknown (due to altered mental status). On consultation, House-Brackmann grade 6 paralysis was common (13/19). Fracture was otic capsule-sparing in 17/19 (90%), universally comminuted, with significant disruption along the mastoid tip (16/19), external auditory canal (EAC) (15/19), and periauricular soft tissues (13/19). Nine patients underwent surgical intervention: Transmastoid facial nerve decompression to remove compressive bony spicules (n = 5); eye protection surgery (n = 3); and peripheral facial nerve exploration (n = 1), noting transection at the pes. One required middle cranial fossa and transmastoid repair of cerebrospinal fistulae in setting of severe meningitis. House-Brackmann scores improved in 80% following transmastoid nerve decompression despite CT evidence of likely additional injury in its extratemporal course. Conclusions: Common patterns of temporal bone fracture seen in blunt trauma (longitudinal/transverse, otic capsule-sparing/disrupting) were not found in patients with ballistic facial nerve injury. Rather, injury was commonly apparent in the EAC, mastoid tip, and periauricular soft tissues. Clinicians should have high suspicion for extratemporal facial nerve injury following ballistic trauma.

N2  - Purpose: To compare cartilage tympanoplasty (CT) combined with eustachian tube balloon dilatation (ETBD) and cartilage tympanoplasty alone as a surgical treatment modality for adhesive otitis media (AdOM) in terms of graft healing, audiological outcomes, and impact on life style, using Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15). Methods: 50 patients with AdOM were randomly classified into 2 groups: 25 patients for cartilage tympanoplasty only (CT group) and 25 patients for cartilage tympanoplasty combined with eustachian tube balloon dilatation (CT + ETBD group). Clinical outcomes in both groups were compared at 3 and 6 months of follow up. Results: There was no significant difference in graft healing between the two groups. Postoperative COMOT-15 scores significantly decreased in both groups with a significant difference between the groups with regard to the decrease in COMOT-15 scores at 3 and 6 months of follow-up (P < 0.05). Hearing improvement was achieved, as the mean preoperative ABG was 26.5 ± 5.4 and 27.1 ± 4.6 dB, and the mean postoperative ABG at 6 months was 19.4 ± 4.4 and 14.6 ± 3.9 dB in the CT and the CT + ETBD groups, respectively. The difference in the magnitude of ABG reduction in the two groups was significant at 3 and 6 months of postoperative follow-up (P < 0.05) in favour of the CT + ETBD group. Conclusion: ETBD can increase the success rate of cartilage tympanoplasty in patients with AdOM by enhancing the audiological outcome and quality of life.

N2  - Objectives: Endoscopic trans-canal tympanoplasty type I (ETT) is gradually diffusing worldwide. It mainly allows less invasive surgery in children with respect to a microscope approach by avoiding post-auricular access. The aim of this study is to illustrate our experience in endoscopic reconstruction of tympanic membrane, using autologous tragus perichondrium (TP) and non-autologous acellular porcine small intestinal sub-mucosa (SIS) as grafts. Methods: Between January 2011 and December 2020, the results of a prospective non-randomized series of consecutive ETT were analyzed. The primary outcome was closure rate at 6 months and secondary outcomes are closure rates associated with age, size of perforation, type of perforation and middle ear status, presence of myringosclerosis, type of graft, status of contralateral ear, adenoidectomy and pre-postoperative ABG change. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical package. Results: One hundred and sixteen consecutive procedures, mean age 9.4 years (range 4–17 years), were evaluated. TP and SIS grafts were used in 65 (56%) and 51 (44%) procedures, respectively. Mean duration of surgical procedure was 53 ± 21 min for SIS and 77 ± 18 min for TP (P = 0.001) Total graft intake was 82.8%; TP and SIS intake were 86.2% and 78.4% (P = 0.3), respectively. Graft intake w.r.t. in age stratified age groups was not statistically significant. Average preoperative and postoperative air-bone gap was 12.1 ± 7.6 dB and 5.5 ± 3.8 dB, respectively (P = 0.001). The difference in closure rates was not significant. Neither intra- nor postoperative complications were observed. Conclusions: In children, ETT is an applicable and less invasive technique compared to the microscope and offers less morbidity. The use of SIS contributes additional less invasiveness to endoscopic surgery by avoiding tragus harvesting with a comparable success rate and granting significantly less surgical duration.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the responsiveness of three instruments (disease-specific, generic, and hearing-specific) assessing health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in adult patients undergoing surgery for chronic otitis media (COM). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective correlational study. SETTING: Two otology referral centers in England, United Kingdom. PATIENTS: Consecutive adult patients undergoing middle ear surgery for COM. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HRQoL assessment and audiometry were performed preoperatively and 12 months after surgery. HRQoL was assessed using disease-specific (Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire-12 [COMQ-12]), generic (Euro-Qol-5D-5L), and hearing-specific (Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults [HHIA]) instruments. RESULTS: A total of 52 patients (mean [standard deviation {SD}] age, 47.3 [18.3] yr) were included, with 42 patients completing both preoperative and postoperative COMQ-12 forms. COMQ-12 and HHIA total scores significantly improved after surgery (COMQ-12: mean [SD], 28.3 [11.6] versus 14.8 [10.6]; p < 0.001; HHIA: 42.9 (28.4) versus 32.6 (27.5); p = 0.012). General HRQoL measured with the Euro-Qol-5D-5L was unaffected by surgery ( p > 0.05). The standardized response means for the COMQ-12 and HHIA total scores were 1.21 and 0.44, respectively. Postoperative air conduction thresholds were moderately correlated with the postoperative COMQ-12 ( r = 0.46, p = 0.005) and HHIA ( r = 0.41, p = 0.012) total scores. CONCLUSIONS: Middle ear surgery significantly improved both disease-specific and hearing-specific HRQoL, whereas general HRQoL did not change. Only the COMQ-12 is highly responsive to surgical intervention. This study supports the use of the COMQ-12 to monitor patient-reported outcomes in both research and routine clinical settings.

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences between hearing aids and stapedotomy in quality of life, pure-tone audiometry, binaural hearing, tinnitus severity, and patient satisfaction. RESULTS: Twenty-two patients were included, of which 20 (91%) underwent stapedotomy. Stapedotomy demonstrated increased quality of life according to Glasgow Health Status Inventory scores versus hearing aids (+10.4 ± 9.4 [p = 0.0001]). Stapedotomy versus hearing aids showed improved pure-tone averages (-11.1 ± 11.0 dB [p = 0.002]) and air-bone gaps (-11.8 ± 10.7 dB [p = 0.0006]). Stapedotomy was superior to hearing aids for speech-in-noise recognition in the reverse dichotic condition (-8.4 ± 26.9 dB [p = 0.004]) and showed improved sound localization accuracy in root mean square error (-14.5 ± 24.5 degrees [p = 0.02]). Stapedotomy, but not hearing aids, showed improved patient self-evaluated tinnitus after baseline adjustment according to the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (-8.0 ± 13.4 [p = 0.02]) and visual analog scale for tinnitus intensity (-28.7 ± 34.1 [p = 0.006]). Overall, patients were more satisfied with surgery versus hearing aids. CONCLUSIONS: Stapedotomy remains more effective compared with hearing aids with greater improvements in quality of life, patient satisfaction, hearing outcomes, and self-evaluated tinnitus.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess patient-related risk factors associated with poor outcomes following stapedotomy for otosclerosis. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Academic tertiary care center. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of 107 patients with otosclerosis who underwent stapedotomy between 2013 and 2020. Demographics, comorbidities, and smoking history were obtained. Preoperative and postoperative audiogram data, including air-bone gap (ABG), and complications were collected. Data were analyzed using t test and Fischer's exact test for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. RESULTS: Among 107 patients, 29.5% were smokers and 70.1% non-smokers. Overall, the average ABG-gain 3-months postoperatively was 20.2 dB, and intraoperative and postoperative complications were 3.74 and 13.1%, respectively. Those with a history of otologic procedures had a lower mean ABG gain at 3 months compared with those without previous otologic surgery (14.4 dB versus 20.4 dB, p = 0.018). The average ABG gain at 3-months was not significantly different between those with current, former, or no smoking history, respectively (13.5 versus 18.1 versus 20.6, p = 0.08). Current smokers had 4.5 times greater odds of complications compared with non-smokers, although not statistically significant (95% CI 0.9-22.8, p = 0.1912). CONCLUSION: Age and history of otologic procedures as independent risk factors did impact hearing outcomes among our patient cohort; however, smoking history did not. Future prospective studies are required to further investigate complication rates by various modifiable risk factors, such as smoking status, body mass index (BMI), and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) use, for stapedotomy surgeries.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The study aims to investigate the effect of stapedotomy on audiology measurements and the disease-specific health-related quality of life for patients with otosclerosis using the Danish Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25 as a quality of life measuring tool. METHODS: In this study, 50 patients who had undergone stapedotomy at our department between September 2017 and December 2020 were included. Data collection was performed by audiometric testing (pure tone and speech audiometry) in the pre- and postoperative settings. Health-related quality of life was assessed pre- and postoperatively in 30 patients using the validated Danish Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25. RESULTS: The mean improvement in air conduction thresholds was 27.7 dB and the mean improvement in air-bone gap was 21.8 dB. Health- related quality of life improved significantly after stapes surgery in all subscores of the Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25 (hearing, mental condition, social restriction, and general), except for "tinnitus." The improvement in the audiometric data correlated significantly with the improvement in "total score" and "hearing function" but not with "tinnitus," "social restrictions," and "mental condition." CONCLUSION: Stapedotomy leads to significant improvement in hearing and health-related quality of life. The Stapesplasty Outcome Test-25 can be used as a valuable supplement to the hearing test by assessing health-related quality of life.

N2  - Introduction: Preserving maximal quality of life is an important factor in middle ear surgery according to current standards. Taste disturbance is a common postoperative complication, which can be explained with the risk of injury due to the localisation of chorda tympani. The knowledge about this complication is mandatory for optimal surgical decision-making and for patient education as well. Objective: Investigation of early postoperative taste disturbances, to clarify the differences between the impact of dif¬ferent surgical interventions, and the impact of nerve manipulation. Methods: 15 stapes surgeries and 28 tympanoplasties were investigated. Patients answered subjective questionnaires before surgery and on the first postoperative day. Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to measure the degree of disturbances (0-10). Degree of nerve manipulation was classified into 5 groups. Results: No significant differences between the impact of stapes surgeries and tympanoplasties could be found (9, 9.1; p = 0.861). In groups '0', '1' and '2', the VAS scores were 10, 9.26, and 8.5. Between the groups "no manipulation" (0) and "significant manipulation without macroscopic injury" (2), the difference was significant (10, 8.5; p = 0.039). In the stapes surgery group, no severe taste disturbance (VAS<5) was found. Discussion: In the case of adequate microscopic surgical technique, the rate of postoperative taste disturbances is relatively low. Conclusions: The rate of postoperative taste disturbance could be kept at a low level while the continuity of the chorda tympani could be preserved in the majority of cases. The postoperative morbidity rate is primarily influenced by the degree of nerve manipulation and not by the type of surgery.

N2  - Background: The rise in the use of prescription opioids for postoperative analgesia within surgery has mirrored an increased trend of opioid-related morbidity within Canada and the United States. This study prospectively studied daily pain levels and medication requirements postoperatively in patients undergoing elective Otolaryngology—Head and Neck surgery procedures. Methods: Patients were asked to prospectively document their pain level and medication use daily for 7 days postoperatively. A final survey was used to quantify unused medication left at home and clarify each patient's disposal plan. We included patients undergoing elective outpatient or short stay surgeries from three tertiary care centers in Toronto, Ontario from September 2016 to September 2017. Previous opioids users or patients suffering from chronic pain were excluded. Results: A final cohort of 56 eligible adult patients were included in the study. The most common procedures were thyroidectomy (n = 19), endoscopic sinus surgery (n = 10), tympanoplasty/ossiculoplasty (n = 7), and cochlear implant (n = 5). Most patients received a prescription for acetaminophen/codeine (n = 29, 51.8%) or acetaminophen/oxycodone (n = 22, 39.3%) and used on average 29% of their initial prescription. Patients most commonly opted to keep their unused narcotics at home (n = 23, 41%). A total of 710 tablets of narcotics were overprescribed in our study population, 351 of which were kept in patients' home for future use. Conclusion: There is a clear tendency to overestimate postoperative pain resulting in significant overprescription of opioids among Otolaryngologists.

N2  - Introduction: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is one of the most frequent ear illnesses and one of the primary causes of hearing loss. The current study was designed to evaluate the improvement in hearing after tympanoplasty in CSOM patients who presented to a tertiary care teaching hospital. MaterialsAnd Methods: The current study was a prospective observational study that took place in the department of ENT at Viswarabharathi Medical College and General Hospital from March 2019 to February 2020. The study included 50 individuals who were clinically diagnosed with chronic suppurative otitis media Tubotympanic type illness. Pre-operatively, pure tone audiometry was performed, and hearing loss and the mean AB Gap were recorded. Tympanoplasty type 1 was done with or without mastoidectomy. After 6 weeks, all of these patients were followed up on and Pure tone audiometry was done. The outcomes of hearing loss and mean AB Gap were compared to pre-operative data. Results: In the current study, out of 50 patients, male participants were 21(42%) and female participants were 29 (58%).The majority of the study population were between 20 to 60 years. Out of 50 subjects, 9(18%) had small central perforation, 23 (46%) participants had medium central and 18 (36%) participants had large central perforation. The mean preandpostoperative outcomes in terms of Pure tone audiometry (p<0.05) and Air-bone gap (p<0.05) were significant. Conclusion: In our study, the post-operative Mean AB Gap was substantially improved as compared to the pre-operative Mean AB Gap. Timely treatment of CSOM with tympanoplasty can have a considerable favourable influence on the affected individual's hearing condition, which in turn can have a good impact on recurring infection rates and the individual's quality of life.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the long-term quality of life (QoL) in patients operated for cholesteatoma by canal wall-up tympanoplasty (CWUT) or canal wall-down tympanoplasty (CWDT) with mastoid obliteration. Methods: QoL was evaluated by the Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire - 12 (COMQ-12). For each patient, the total score and three partial subscores, concerning disease activity, functional impairment and general impact on the patient's life were calculated. These scores were correlated with the surgical technique, as well as anatomical and functional results. Results: 68 procedures were classified as CWUT and 78 as CWDT with obliteration. The mean follow-up was 65 months. Total and partial COMQ-12 scores did not show any significant difference between the two groups. Correlation analysis showed a significant direct association between the postoperative Air-Bone Gap (ABG) and both the COMQ-12 total score and functional subscore in the CWUT group. Conclusions: This is the first study comparing CWUT and CWDT with obliteration with the COMQ-12, thus confirming the overlapping results in terms of QoL. These findings, together with the evidence of the significantly lower rates of recidivism, show that CWDT with obliteration should be considered as a good alternative to CWUT.

N2  - Introduction and objective: Mastoid obliteration technique combines the advantages of canal wall-up (CWU) and canal wall-down (CWD) approaches in the surgery of chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma. We aim to demonstrate our experience with mastoid obliteration technique using bone dust and BonAlive® (S53P4) bioactive glass granule in a comparative prospective clinical study. Patients and methods: Between 1st of March 2012 and 31st of November 2021, mastoid obliteration surgery was performed in 14 patients using bone dust (7 cases) and BonAlive® granule (7 cases). Prior to these interventions, the patients had undergone more than three ear surgeries (CWU and CWD) generally in both groups. Changes of complaints, audiological results, and changes in quality of life were analysed in both groups, postoperatively. Results: Having performed the mastoid obliteration technique, cochlear damage did not occur in either patient group. Long-term ear discharge and vertigo were occasionally observed after performing obliteration with bone dust. However, these complaints disappeared after a while. Complications were not reported in the case of obliteration with BonAlive®. Outstanding improvement was experienced in both groups. Conclusion: In our practice, mastoid obliteration surgery, using either bone dust or BonAlive® granule, has proved to be a safe and effective method in the management of chronic suppurative otitis media with cholesteatoma, resulting in continuous putrid ear discharge after CWU or CWD tympanoplasty. Obliteration with BonAlive® granule provides several advantages for patients, such as antibacterial effect, osteoconductive effect ensuring frame for bone growth and osteoproductive effect stimulating the ossification.

N2  - Introduction and method Short-term hearing rehabilitation, e.g. after ear surgery or as a bridge before secondary hearing rehabilitation, can also be of high importance for quality of life. We investigated whether patients benefit from this in a prospective study of 100 patients. Results After checking the study prerequisites, 100 patients (4 - 82 years, median 38 years, 54 men, 46 women) were prospectively included in the study and fitted with an adhesive hearing aid (ADHEAR, MedEL company) after middle ear surgery for the duration of the ear tamponade. 84 % of the patients were satisfied or very satisfied with the hearing impression. 2/3 of the patients used the ADHEAR hearing aid more than 7 hours a day. 88 % found the ADHEAR to be a useful hearing aid. Discussion Both the questionnaire results and the audiological tests showed a very high acceptance and satisfaction with the investigated (temporary) hearing aid fitting. Especially the hearing in noise increased significantly. Especially with regard to the social integration and rehabilitation of hearing impaired patients as well as the very positive results of this so far largest study on ADHEAR, the only temporary hearing rehabilitation, e.g. after ear surgery, should also be considered as a standard method. For this purpose, a corresponding funding capability should be established on the part of the cost bearers.

N2  - Introduction The advantages of using endoscopes in ear surgery are well described and relate mainly to its ability to provide high quality images, visualization of the retrotympanum, sinus tympani and corners of middle ear cleft, which are often a challenge in the microscopic approach. Health-related quality of life (QoL) is very important to understand the impact of medical or surgical interventions on the patient. Objectives To reveal advantages of endoscopic versus microscopic approach in ear surgery through assessment and comparison of postoperative quality of life. Materials and Methods A disease-specific 13-item Likert scale outcome survey, the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), was introduced to evaluate the quality of life (QoL) in patients after surgery for chronic ear disease. The survey consists of the following 3 categories: an activity restriction-based subscale (AR), a symptom subscale (ST), and a medical resource utilization (MR) subscale. A retrospective study was held at the ORL department of Kasr Al-Ainy Hospital, Cairo University. It included patients older than 18 who underwent ear surgery from January 2018 to July 2021 including tympanoplasty and cholesteatoma excision. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to approach of surgery (endoscopic or microscopic) to compare postoperative quality of life (QoL) using the Chronic Ear Survey (CES). Results Our study reported statistically significant difference between both groups in total and all subscales scores in favour of patients who underwent trans endoscopic ear surgery (TEES). Conclusion There has been a greater impact on total, general and social aspects of quality of life (QoL) amongst patients who had undergone endoscopic ear surgery compared to those undergoing an open surgical approach.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To compare audiologic outcomes, quality-of-life (QoL) and usage-of-device (UoD) between case-matched, otosclerotic patients with mixed hearing loss (MHL) which received (a) stapedotomy and postoperative amplification with hearing aids (SDT+HA) or (b) short-incudial process coupled active middle ear implant with simultaneous stapedotomy (mPP). STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Prospective, matched case-control, follow-up study conducted at two tertiary otologic referral centers. Eligible were all otosclerotic patients with MHL, which received mPP at either of the two institutions. A case-matched-cohort of SDT+HA-patients was generated from the hospitals database based on preoperative audiologic findings. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: For sound- and speech perception, primary outcome parameters were the mean postoperative, aided air-conduction pure tone average (mpa-AC-PTA) and word recognition score at 80 dB speech level (mpa-WRS), for QoL the mean Nijmegen-Cochlear-Implant-Questionnaire (NCIQ) total-score, and for UoD the mean score rated on a 10-point Likert-scale. RESULTS: A total of 28 patients were included; 14 received mPP; mpa-AC-PTA and mpa-WRS significantly improved from 47.1 dB-HL to 34.3 dB-HL (-12.8 dB-HL; p < 0.001) and from 75.0% to 93.2% (+18.2%; p = 0.002) compared to 46.5 dB-HL to 31.9 dB-HL (-14.8 dB-HL; p < 0.008) and 75.0% to 93.2% (+18.2%; p = 0.002) for SDT+HA. No significant difference between groups was observed (all p > 0.1). NCIQ total-score between groups did not significantly differ (70.4 vs. 69.9; p = 0.93). UoD for mPP was significantly higher (6.1 vs. 3.0; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: If medical/technical problems prevent usage of HA in otosclerosis with MHL, mPP can be considered as effective treatment option with similar audiological outcome and QoL. A significantly higher UoD for mPP was observed.

N2  - Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the speech intelligibility benefit in noise provided by stapedotomy in the treatment of unilateral otosclerosis. Methods: We enrolled adults suffering from unilateral conductive hearing loss and followed them up until 9 months after surgery. The patients underwent a free field speech hearing evaluation using the French Matrix test before and after stapedotomy. Speech material was sent to the front of the patients (S0) and noise was presented either at the front (N0), or at the operated ear (N-90) or at the non-operated ear (N + 90). The speech intelligibility benefit in noise was assessed by comparing Squelch effect (SE), Head shadow effect (HS) and Binaural redundancy (BR) before and after surgery. SE was measured as the difference in speech reception thresholds (SRT) between S0N + 90 situations before and after surgery, HS as the difference in SRT between S0N + 90 and S0N-90 situations, and BR as the difference in SRT between S0N0 situations before and after surgery. In addition, two quality of life’s questionnaires were completed by patients to evaluate their discomfort. Results: Among 25 patients, 19 were followed up during 9 months, 4 were excluded and 2 were lost for the following-up. Stapedotomy provided a restoration of SE of 3.7 dB SNR (p < 0.001) and a BR gain of 1.8 dB SNR (p < 0.001). HS did not show any statistical variation after surgery (p = 0.077). Finally, the questionnaires showed a residual hearing discomfort. Conclusion: Stapedotomy provided a binaural benefit with the restoration of the SE and BR but which remained lower than in the normal-hearing population. Trial Registration: The 07/02/2018 on Clinical.Trial.Gouv: NCT03587792.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) is considered a minimally invasive technique. It is hypothesized that patients after endoscopic procedures experience less pain and require fewer painkillers. Our aim was to compare patients' postoperative pain and need for analgesics in patients undergoing microscopic and endoscopic ear surgeries. METHODS: a single-institution, prospective study included 92 patients undergoing ear procedures (48 cholesteatoma and 44 reconstructive);(43 endoscopic and 49 microscopic) during 1/2016-1/2018. The postoperative pain (visual analogue scale (VAS) 0-10) and painkillers consumption were recorded and compared in each subgroup. RESULTS: VAS (P=0.02) and analgesics consumption (P=0.06) were lower after endoscopic ear surgeries. In the cholesteatoma group, 94% of endoscopic patients reported VAS 0-2 in contrast to 58 % of microscopic patients on day 1 (P=0.04). Similar tendencies were revealed in reconstructive cases, i.e. 92% compared to 73% (P>0.05). On day 1, 92% of endoscopic, and 77% of microscopic reconstruction patients received no painkillers group (P=0.06). In the cholesteatoma patients, 88% of endoscopic patients, 43% of microscopic patients using endaural approach, and 75% of microscopic patients using retroauricular approach, required no painkillers on the postoperative day 1 (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that the EES is associated with less postoperative pain than the conventional microscopic ear surgery. It seems that it is rather the transmeatal approach, and not the endoscope itself that reduces postoperative pain. The removal of the same size cholesteatoma using endoscope (rather than using microscope) leads to less intensive postoperative pain. Consequently, it was not surprising that patients after endoscopic ear surgery very rarely took painkillers.

N2  - Age-related hearing loss (ARHL) may limit communication, which is closely associated with cognitive decline of the elderly and negatively affects their quality of life. In ARHL patients who suffer chronic otitis media (COM), hearing impairment may worsen and negatively affect the cognition and quality of life. It is currently unknown whether restoration of the conductive hearing in the mixed hearing loss through middle ear surgeries can improve both the cognitive function and quality of life of the ARHL patients. Therefore, in the present study, the ARHL patients were followed up for 6 months after middle ear surgeries for COM, and both the cognitive functions and quality of life of the patients were assessed using Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Glasgow Benefit Inventory. It was found that both the cognitive functions and quality of life were improved 6 months after middle ear surgeries. In conclusion, hearing recovery after middle ear surgeries could improve cognitive functions and quality of life of ARHL patients with COM, and surgical intervention is, hence, recommended for COM.

N2  - Purpose: To compare the relationship between the variable “complication” and the other variables of middle ear cholesteatoma classifications (STAMCO, ChOLE, and SAMEO-ATO). Methods: Retrospective study of 110 patients that underwent 132 middle ear surgeries between the 1 January 2012 and the 31 December 2019 for chronic otitis with cholesteatoma classified according to STAMCO, ChOLE, and SAMEO-ATO classifications in a tertiary health care centre. Results: Older age, male gender, STAMCO-T, and SAMEO-ATO [O1, T, O2, (s -)] and mastoid involvement (STAMCO-M and ChOLE-Ch) were associated with an increased risk of complication report. Conclusions: In our series, statistical analysis pointed out a relationship between surgical complications and age, gender, site, mastoidectomy type, and ossicular chain status at surgery. The choice of variables to be recorded for cholesteatoma staging should be carefully balanced, considering that “complication” variable could be a repetitive item.

N2  - A long-term, retrospective, non-controlled study was performed on the drainage results of mastoidectomy (both radical and modified radical) and the relevant statis- tical factors that could influence the anatomic outcome were defined. The present study took into consideration the same cohort of 200 patients we have communicated with before in our previous studies concerning the long-term functional results of mastoidectomy and long-term results of ossicular replacement with biovitroceramic prosthesis. The patients were clinically followed for the same period of 8.12 years. The drainage (anatomic) results, similar to previously published functional results, were defined by analytical function of the severity and the period of evolution of disease. The main goal was to define the situations and factors (presence of complica- tions, type of disease, type of tympanic perforation or status of ossicular chain) that influenced the drainage results that could provide us with some type of anatomical prognosis. The follow-up started at the moment of complete epithelization for each cavity as time represents the main study comparison criteria. Drainage failure was assessed by the number of otorrhea episodes. It was concluded that practically and ideally, a maximum of 84% of the mastoid and petrous cells can be cleaned out. The results of 78% drainage success are congruent to this theory. The remaining 16% of cells may contain irreversible lesions.

N2  - Purpose: To assess the postoperative quality of life (QoL) of patients operated on for chronic otitis media (COM) and cholesteatoma by endoscopic approach, with respect to disease-specific complaints and psychological distress, using two validated questionnaires: Chronic Ear Survey (CES) and Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21). Methods: Eighty-five consecutive patients operated on for cholesteatoma and COM by endoscopic tympanoplasty from March 2018 to February 2020 filled in CES and DASS-21, within one month prior to surgery. A second administration of each questionnaire was performed at the yearly postoperative evaluation. A multivariate analysis using a linear regression model was performed to evaluate the role of the different variables associated with the questionnaires’ subscales and overall scores. Results: A significant improvement was achieved in all CES and DASS-21 subscales after endoscopic tympanoplasty. No patient showed a DASS-21 score compatible with a psychological distress both at the pre- and postoperative assessments. At multivariate analysis, the only significant factors associated with postoperative improvement in CES scores were preoperative DASS-21 “depression” score and months of follow-up. Conclusion: Endoscopic tympanoplasty shows significantly improved QoL as assessed by disease-specific and psycho-emotional questionnaires. A subjective favourable effect of fully endoscopic ear surgery was demonstrated.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this study was to present our concept in the management of extracranial temporal bone paragangliomas and demonstrate the outcome after primary surgical management of the middle ear component, with an individualized indication for adjuvant radiotherapy. Materials and methods: The records of all patients treated for extracranial jugulotympanic paragangliomas by means of primary surgical management between 2010 and 2021 were studied retrospectively. Results: Twenty-nine patients made up our study sample (mean age 58.8 years). 15 cases were managed solely by means of surgery. Out of the remaining 14 cases with reduction of the middle ear component, adjuvant irradiation was performed in 11 cases, whereas a wait-and-scan strategy was adopted at the patient's request in three cases. No further growth was detected in our study cases. Conclusion: Our protocol seems to be associated with an acceptable quality of life and a satisfactory oncologic outcome.

N2  - Purpose: Several risk factors were studied in endoscopic type I. tympanoplasty, however, an easy-to-use risk stratification model is still missing. Methods: Retrospective chart review, focusing on individual risk factors and middle ear risk index (MERI). Patients who underwent endoscopic type I. tympanoplasty were included. Results: Closed tympanic cavity was succesfully created in 88.1% of the 42 cases, the overall 21,5 dB air–bone gap (ABG) was reduced by 9,8 dB. The average MERI score of the patients was 2.1 ± 1.5. 78.6% of the patients were categorised into the mild, while 21.4% into the moderate risk group. The perforation was considered small in 81.0% of the cases, while large in 19.0%. The size of the perforation and the preoperative ABG, but not the MERI status were the only single predictors of success. Using a risk stratification model that is based on the size of the perforation, the preoperative ABG and MERI status, patients could be referred into two distinct groups of risk: the majority expecting excellent outcomes with maximum one risk factor present, and patients with deteriorated rate of success when having two or three risk factors. Conclusions: Endoscopic type I. tympanoplasty with underlay perichondrium graft can be performed with good chance of success. However, if more than one risk factors are present, the chance of residual perforation becomes great. In addition to the established risk factors, our results point out that despite its strong correlation with perforation size, ABG may have a predictive role.

N2  - Background: Chronic otitis media (COM) remains a major public health issue and is associated with relentless discharge from the ear, pain, significant functional limitation of hearing, leading to communication problems and frequent specialist visits. Aims: To assess the improvement in quality of life of patients of COM (safe type) and surgical success in terms of graft uptake and improvement in hearing. Patients and Methods: A prospective questionnaire-based outcome study was directed in 100 patients with COM who were treated with Type I Tympanoplasty at our institution between May 2018 and May 2020. All patients were asked to fill Modified Chronic Otitis Media 4 (COM-4) survey before operation and 3 months after operation. Preoperative and postoperative total ear scores, audiological results, postoperative graft uptake were assessed. Results: The correlation between preoperative and postoperative assessment by questionnaire was statistically critical (P < 0.001). There was significant improvement in hearing postoperatively (P < 0.001). Effective graft uptake was seen in 80%. Conclusion: The current study emphasizes that Type 1 Tympanoplasty fundamentally improves quality of life of patients in terms of physical suffering, hearing loss, emotional distress postoperatively.

N2  - Objective and intervention: To compare the efficacy of the inlay, composite chondroperichondrial clip (triple-C) tympanoplasty with conventional underlay cartilage island tympanoplasty, and to evaluate its efficacy in treating large, marginal perforations. Study design: The study involved 183 patients that were selected from a retrospective chart review of tympanoplasties performed at our center from March 2016 to June 2018. Setting: A tertiary referral center hospital. Patients: 65 patients underwent inlay, triple-C cartilage tympanoplasty (inlay group) and 118 underwent underlay cartilage island tympanoplasty (underlay group). Main outcome measures: Postoperative anatomical success rate, surgical time, hearing outcomes, and complications were analyzed. Focused analysis was performed on large or marginal perforations. Results: Both groups exhibited similar characteristics in demographic distribution, general health status, preoperative anatomical and hearing disabilities. Excellent results were achieved in both groups. Re-perforation occurred for 9.2% of the inlay group and 7.6% of the underlay group (p = 0.71). Hearing improvement was significant in both groups. Within the separate groups, 36% of underlay patients and 60% of inlay patients improved to achieve closure of the air–bone gap (ABG) to less than 10 dB (p = 0.1). In large or marginal perforations, both groups performed similarly. No significant complications were seen in this cohort. Nevertheless, a significant reduction in surgical time was observed in the inlay group (38 min. vs 58 min.; p = 0.0004). Conclusion: Inlay triple-C tympanoplasty is comparable to conventional underlay cartilage island tympanoplasty in both anatomical and audiological success rates, even for large, marginal perforations. Due to its shorter operation time, inlay triple-C tympanoplasty should be considered a good surgical option for all tympanic membrane perforations.

N2  - Purpose: Different types of chronic middle ear disease (CMED) present with differing severity of single symptoms, such as discharge, vertigo or hearing loss, which impair health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Here, we aimed to (i) investigate characteristics of HRQoL and (ii) evaluate the association between HRQoL and hearing among different types of CMED. Methods: In this prospective longitudinal cohort study, we included adult patients undergoing surgical treatment for CMED. Primary outcomes included HRQoL assessed by the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21) and hearing assessed by pure-tone audiometry. Results: In the included 108 patients (51% females), CMED were chronic otitis media (COM) with (n = 46) or without (n = 22) cholesteatoma, persistent mastoid cavity (with [n = 15] or without [n = 10] recurrent cholesteatoma), revision ossiculoplasty for hearing restoration (n = 14), and postinflammatory meatal fibrosis (n = 1). Preoperatively, the mean ZCMEI-21 score showed statistically significant differences among different types of CMED (p = 0.007) with persistent mastoid cavity without cholesteatoma exhibiting the highest score (34.1, SD 7.7) indicating poor HRQoL. At a mean follow-up period of 183 days, no statistically significant differences in the ZCMEI-21 scores among different types of CMED were observed (p = 0.67). Conclusion: This study objectifies differences in HRQoL among different types of CMED. In patients with indication for functional surgery only, e.g., persistent mastoid cavity without cholesteatoma, the worst HRQoL was observed. Yet, in these types of CMED, HRQoL guides decision for treatment. Moreover, differences in HRQoL among different types of CMED were not closely associated with hearing, but largely depended on other symptoms, such as discharge or vertigo.

N2  - Objectives: The main study endpoint was tolerance of stapedotomy under local anesthesia with sedation and under general anesthesia using stress and quality of life assessment questionnaires. Secondary endpoints comprised operative time and functional results. Material and method: In a consecutive series of stapedotomy patients operated on over a 12-month period, quality of life and perioperative stress were analysed by 3 questionnaires: the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, Cohen's perceived stress scale and the Post-traumatic stress disorder checklist scale. Questionnaire responses and audiometric data were compared between groups treated under local anesthesia with sedation and under general anesthesia. Results: Twenty-two patients were included in the local anesthesia with sedation group and 6 in the general anesthesia group. There was no difference between the groups for quality of life, onset of post-traumatic stress, or perceived pre- and postoperative stress. There was also no difference in operative time. The audiometric data confirmed the reliability of stapedotomy. Stapedotomy under local anesthesia with sedation improved air conduction with ≤ 10 dB air-bone gap (ABG), comparable to results under general anesthesia. The rate of ABG ≤ 10 dB was 71.4%; no labyrinthisation was observed. Conclusion: Under local anesthesia with sedation, stapedotomy was well tolerated without increasing the stress associated with otosclerosis surgery. By correcting hearing loss, the procedure improves quality of life.

N2  - In this blinded clinical trial, we attempted to compare the efficacy and safety of administering tranexamic acid, dexmedetomidine and nitroglycerin in preventing intraoperative bleeding and improving the quality of the surgical field during septorhinoplasty under general anesthesia. A total of 105 patients scheduled for septorhinoplasty were enrolled and randomly assigned into three groups based on the balanced-block randomization method. First group received 1 μg/kg intravenous injection dexmedetomidine, second group received 10 mg/kg intravenous injection tranexamic acid and third group received 0.5 μg/kg nitroglycerin, intravenously. The study sample was composed of 105 participants with the total mean age of 25.85 ± 6.52 years, and 59.05% of participants were female and the mean of body mass index was 24.34 ± 2.57 kg/m2. The results showed that there was no statistically significant difference in terms of arterial oxygen saturation, mean arterial pressure, heart rate, bleeding rate, duration of surgery, and surgeon satisfaction among the three groups; however, there was a significant difference in the extubation time, recovery time and the dose of administered propofol among the three groups. Dexmedetomidine reduced the dose of administered propofol while increasing the extubation time and recovery time. In the tranexamic acid group compared with the other two groups, the recovery time was shorter. However, all the three drugs could reduce intraoperative bleeding and lead to surgeon satisfaction. It can be concluded that all these three drugs can be utilized to control bleeding and improve the quality of the surgical field but the ultimate decision lies with the anesthesiologist's judgment and the conditions of the patient. The study protocol was registered in the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (registration No. IRCT20141209020258N121) on September 24, 2019 and it was ethically approved by the Ethical Committee of Arak University of Medical Sciences (approval No. IR.ARAKMU.REC.1397.355) on February 24, 2019.

N2  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine whether preoperative depressive symptoms influence health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after middle ear surgery in patients with chronic otitis media (COM). Methods: This prospective clinical case study was conducted at a tertiary referral center. All 102 patients who had undergone middle ear surgery for COM were assessed clinically and by audiometric testing (pure tone audiometry) in pre- and postoperative settings. Disease-specific HRQOL was assessed by the validated chronic otitis media outcome test 15 (COMOT-15) and the Zurich chronic middle ear inventory (ZCMEI-21). General HRQOL was measured using the short form 36 (SF-36). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-D). The Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) was used to classify comorbidities. The middle ear status was determined using the ossiculoplasty outcome parameter staging (OOPS) index. Results: After middle ear surgery, the total COMOT-15 and ZCMEI-21 scores improved significantly (p < 0.001). General HRQOL (total SF-36 score) was unaffected by surgery (p < 0.05). Patients without elevated depressive symptoms had significantly better total scores for the COMOT-15 (p < 0.01), ZCMEI-21 (p < 0.001), and for SF-36 (p < 0.001) postoperatively. The results of the multiple regression analyses show that, after adjusting for the OOPS, CCI, and hearing improvement, preoperative depressiveness was significantly associated with worse postoperative COMOT-15 and ZCMEI-21 outcome scores (β = 0.425 and β = 0.362, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Preoperative depressiveness was an essential predictive factor for HRQOL in patients with COM. This should be considered during patient selection to provide more suitable preoperative counseling.

N2  - Introduction: The goal of this study was to explore how income disparities may affect length of stay (LOS) and hospital charges of patients undergoing inpatient tympanoplasty. Method: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify patients who underwent tympanoplasty from 2012 to 2017. Relevant demographics were analyzed. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine (1) LOS and (2) total hospital charges based on varying demographics, income level, and insurance type (defined by government vs private). Results: A total of 4,100 inpatient tympanoplasty cases were identified. The majority of these patients were male (53.8%), White (67.2%) and underwent surgery at an urban teaching hospital (87.2%). Many patients had government insurance (54.9%) and lower income status (defined by an annual income less than the median of $51,000) (52.0%). Having a private insurance carrier was found to be predictive of a LOS of less than two days (OR 0.707, 95% CI, 0.598-0.836, P < .001) when compared with patients with government insurance. Similarly, when looking at predictors of total hospital charges, having private insurance was associated with total charges of less than $41,000 (OR 0.735, 95% CI 0.625- 0.865, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Patients with private insurance who underwent inpatient tympanoplasty are more likely to have shorter hospital stays and hospital charges. These findings depict the impact of income and insurance status disparities on health care cost within otolaryngology.

N2  - Introduction: An international advisory board has been established to support an initiative to develop a clinical best practice pathway to treat hearing loss after surgical treatment of chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma. Developing clinical best practices begins with an exhaustive literature review and selection of outcomes measures to direct future research efforts. Method: A comprehensive MEDLINE literature was conducted using keywords including chronic otitis media, cholesteatoma, hearing loss, ossiculoplasty, osseointegration, aural rehabilitation, hearing restoration, and outcomes. Data were accumulated to understand how hearing outcomes are reported after surgery for chronic otitis media with effusion and cholesteatoma and compared with the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS)- standardized guideline for reporting postoperative hearing. After a review of available hearing outcomes instruments, consensus voting among the advisory board selected the middle ear risk index, the Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15, and an adapted version of the Client Service Receipt Inventory as currently available instruments deemed most suitable for assessing hearing outcomes patients with chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma. Results: No standardized pathway was identified for planning hearing restoration after surgery for chronic otitis media. The AAO-HNS hearing outcome standard was underutilized, and few studies measured patient outcomes or costeffectiveness with standardized tools. We propose a middle ear index for assessing patients preoperatively. The Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 evaluates health-related quality of life before and after surgery, and the Client Service Receipt Inventory measures health care utilization and the impact of care on patients' economic status. Conclusion: We present a current state of the literature and propose an evidence-based approach, including patient outcome and cost utility measures to establish a baseline for future development of evidenced-based clinical best practice care regarding hearing rehabilitation of patients with chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma.

N2  - Objective: To review the published literature related to the different obliteration and reconstruction techniques in the management of the canal wall down mastoidectomy. Methods: A PubMed (Medline) and LILACS databases as well as crossed references search was performed with the following Mesh terms: “cholesteatoma”, “cholesteatoma-middle ear”, “otitis media”, “otitis media, suppurative”, “mastoiditis”, “mastoidectomy”, “canal wall down mastoidectomy”, “radical mastoidectomy”, “mastoid obliteration” and crossed references. Inclusion criteria were adult patients subject to mastoid cavity obliteration and posterior canal wall reconstruction. The technique and materials used, anatomic and functional results, complications, recurrence rates, and changes in quality of life, were analyzed. A total of 94 articles were screened, 38 were included for full-text detailed review. Results: Twenty-one articles fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Techniques and materials used for canal wall reconstruction, tympanoplasty, and ossiculoplasty were varied and included autologous, biosynthetic, or both. Auditory results were reported in 16 studies and were inconsistent. Three studies reported improvement in the quality of life using the GBI scale. Follow-up time ranged from 1 to 83 months. Eleven articles used imaging studies to evaluate postoperative disease recurrence. The highest recurrence rate reported for cholesteatoma after obliteration was 19%. The most frequently reported complications were retraction pockets and transient otorrhea. Conclusion: Plenty of techniques combining grafts and other materials have been used to overcome mastoidectomy cavity problems. So far, it is still not possible to standardize an ideal procedure. The available level of evidence for this topic is low and limited.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to translate the chronic otitis media questionnaire-12 (COMQ-12) into the Arabic language, evaluate the internal consistency of the test and test-retest reliability, and validate the adaptation for further use in Arabic studies. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective observation monocenter cohort study. SETTINGS: This study was done at Kafrelsheikh University Hospital, Egypt. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty five ear pathology-free patients were asked to complete the questionnaire forming group A. One hundred twenty five patients with different forms of COM completed the questionnaire 2 weeks before the planned ear surgery and the same day of the operation, forming group B. Those patients who underwent the ear surgery, completed the questionnaire again 6 months after the operation forming group C. INTERVENTION: We did an Arabic forward and backward translation of the original COMQ-12. The patients in group B underwent ear surgery (tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy). After fulfilling the questionnaire in different groups, we assessed the psychometric properties of the Arabic version of COMQ-12: internal consistency, reliability, reproducibility, validity, and responsiveness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cronbach's α was 0.973. The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was 0.981, while the Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.973. RESULTS: A statistically significant difference was present between group A (average total score 2.38 ± 1.543) and group B (average total score 35.86 ± 5.98). Also, there was a statistically significant difference between group B and group C (average total score 7.46 ± 8.294). The calculated cut-off point of the total score was more than or equal to eight. CONCLUSION: The cross-culturally Arabic adaptation of COMQ-12 was reliable, valid with strong internal consistency and responsiveness. It can detect the significant effect of COM on the quality of life of Arabic patients. This effect would be improved obviously after surgical management that markedly enhanced the preoperative hearing problem.

N2  - This study aims to determine the benefit of stapes surgery for otosclerosis in 121 patients with a mixed hearing loss and a preoperative bone conduction (BC) threshold >30 dB. Average postoperative air conduction (AC) improved from 61.5 dB to 34.3 dB. Average air–bone gap closed from 27.1 dB to 6.1 dB. Bone conduction improved from 34.3 dB to 28.2 dB, with 38% of patients achieving a postoperative AC of <30 dB. Glasgow Benefit Inventory scores showed significantly increased quality of life postoperatively in the 88 patients who responded to follow-up, with an average score of 56. There was a mean reduction in daily hearing aid use postsurgery of 5.48 hours, with 56% of patients who responded to follow-up questionnaire no longer needing to use one. When assessing suitability for stapes surgery, surgeons should consider that preoperative BC thresholds may be a poor indicator of the true cochlear reserve and therefore the potential for improvement in AC thresholds and quality of life.

N2  - Tympanic membrane (TM) perforations commonly occur as a result of chronic ear infections, direct trauma or blast injuries, as seen in military and civilian populations following terror attacks. TM perforations result in considerable morbidity, including hearing loss, pain, recurrent infections and decreased quality of life. Repair of chronic TM perforations is typically performed in the operating room under general anesthesia. Recently developed techniques for TM repair afford the option to manage patients in the clinic setting. Herein we describe our endoscopic approach for in-office, awake TM repair and review patient selection, instrumentation, technique and postoperative management. We also discuss outcomes from a cohort study including closure rates, hearing outcomes and patient reported outcome measures.

N2  - Introduction The outcome of middle ear surgery in patients with chronic otitis media (COM) has so far been assessed primarily by audiometric parameters. For years, disease-specific quality of life (HRQoL) has played an increasingly important role in disease assessment. Internationally, a large number of validated measuring instruments are already used to assess HRQoL in patients with COM. The"Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test" (COMOT-15) and the "Zurich chronic middle ear inventory" (ZCMEI-21) are the only validated measuring instruments available in. Methods HRQoL was determined in 79 patients with COM before and 6-12 months after middle ear surgery using COMOT-15, "Chronic Ear Survey" (CES), Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire" (COMQ-12) and the "Hearing Handicap Inventory for Adults" (HHIA). In addition, a retrospective assessment of HRQoL in the preoperative setting was performed by completing all questionnaires again at the end of the study. Results First, all the German translations of the English measuring instruments were validated. All measuring instruments used showed a highly significant improvement (p < 0.001) of HRQoL in the pre- and postoperative comparison. Postoperative HRQoL correlated poorly to moderately with postoperative hearing outcome (r=0.10-0.34). Interestingly, the retrospective assessment of HRQoL showed a clear shift towards better values. This response shift was only clinically relevant in a subscore of COMOT-15 (effect strength 0.59). Conclusion Patients with COM demonstrated an improvement in HRQoL after middle ear surgery. The German translations of the internationally used measuring instruments meet the required quality criteria. When measuring HRQoL in German, the validated versions of CES, COMQ-12 and HHIA should be used in the future in order to compare results with international studies.

N2  - Purpose: To describe and analyse functional treatment of temporal bone chondroblastoma (TBCh). Methods: From January 2000 to June 2019, at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Hôpital Lariboisière, Paris, France, patients with TBCh were enrolled in this study. All cases routinely performed pre-operatory work-up including evaluation of performance status, audio-vestibular function test, ear endoscopy, contrasted CT scan and MRI of head and neck region; in one case we also performed an angio-CT scan. All patients underwent resection of the tumour with a “functional” approach Results: Three male patients (mean age 46,6 years)—two primary tumours and one recurrence—were treated. In all three cases the tumour invaded the middle ear with a variable degree of hearing loss and infiltration of temporal bone structures. All surgeries were performed with a microscopic approach associated with open/endoscopic approach when necessary. Inner ear and facial nerve were speared in all cases and the TMJ was partially resected in 2 cases due to its moderate involvement. At present, after a mean follow-up of 103 months (range 40–225 months), only one case presented recurrence which has been successfully treated with radiotherapy. Conclusions: Our results of treatment suggest that functional surgery can be relevant in the management of TBCh since it is focused on both treatment of this pathology and maintenance of a good quality of life.

N2  - Objective:To assess and compare therapeutic effects and quality of life after endoscopic and microscopic myringoplasty using Chinese version of the Zurich chronic middle ear inventory（ZCMEI）. Methods:Patients with chronic suppurative otitis media underwent myringoplasty at the Third Hospital of Peking University from October 2018 to September 2019 were included in this study and divided into two groups: endoscopic tympanoplasty group（n=40） and microscopic tympanoplasty group（n=57）. ZCMEI survey and pure tone audiometry were conducted preoperatively and 3-9 months postoperatively. The operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital, graft success rate, complication rate, hearing improvement and quality of life improvement were compared. Results:①The operation time, length of hospital and intraoperative blood loss of endoscopic group were significantly lower（P<0.05）. ②The graft success rate was 92.5% and 98.2%, respectively（P>0.05）. The difference between the complication rate in two groups was not significant, but patients in endoscopic group had no symptoms of wound numbness or pain. ③Air conduction threshold（AC） and air-bone gap（ABG） were significantly lower after surgery in endoscopic group（n=33） and microscopic group（n=43）. The analyzed result of generalized linear model indicated surgical approach had no influence on postoperative AC and ABG（P>0.05）. ④The total scores of ZCMEI were significantly improved in endoscopic group（n=32） and microscopic group（n=48） postoperatively, as well as the scores of ear symptoms, hearing and psychosocial impact（P<0.05）. Preoperative and postoperative scores of medical resources were not significantly different in either groups（P>0.05）. Controlling the course of disease, the total ZCMEI results and scores of each subscale in patients with single ear involved（n=71） had no significant difference between two groups. Conclusion:Endoscopic myringoplasty has the advantages of minimal invasiveness, short operation time, and quick recovery evaluated from subjective and objective aspects. Audiometry improvement, graft success rate, complication rate and quality of life improvements are comparable between endoscopic tympanoplasty and conventional microscopic tympanoplasty. The assessment of the quality of life is of great significance in efficacy evaluation of otitis media. Doctors should comprehensively consider patient's subjective experience and the objective improvement to obtain the best clinical efficacy.

N2  - Introduction: Atypical femur fractures (AFF) are reported in patients taking prolonged bisphosphonate therapy, but Paget's disease (PD) has been rarely reported as a cause of AFF. Case: 71-year-old female with past medical history of right hip osteoarthritis, seizure disorder, hypertension, and Hashimoto's thyroiditis presented with persistent right hip pain. There was no history of trauma or fall. She had otosclerosis with bilateral hearing loss and bilateral stapedectomies. Her medications were primidone, levothyroxine, lisinopril-hydrochlorothiazide, and vitamin D. She did not smoke tobacco or drink alcohol. She had elevated serum alkaline phosphatase of 300 U/L (35-104). The X-ray of the skull was negative for any cortical thickening. CT of right femur revealed cortical thickening and coarsening of trabeculae of the proximal right femur consistent with PD and incomplete atypical subtrochanteric proximal fracture. Urine NTx 303 BCE/ mM Cr (<89). Bone scan showed uptake in the R proximal femur, L distal tibia, and L3-L4 vertebral bodies suspicious of PD. DXA showed osteopenia. She was given zoledronic acid 5 mg IV. Discussion: PD leads to an increased incidence of fractures particularly of the lower extremities with most fractures transverse in nature. Non-union is not uncommon1. Stress fractures in PD are caused by disorganized bone remodeling due to excessive breakdown and formation of bone. Our patient met the major criteria for AFF as per the ASBMR 2010 task force report but there was no exposure to bisphosphonates2. The ASBMR task force recommended that bisphosphonates should be discontinued in patients with bisphosphonate-associated AFF due to their severely suppressed bone turnover status. On the other hand, the AFF in patients with PD may heal in response to bisphosphonate treatment.

N2  - Objective: Endoscope has been used as diagnostic tool for recidivism and as an adjunct to microscopic technique in the management of cholesteatoma. At present transcanal endoscopic ear surgery (TEES) is being used as a minimally invasive alternative for microscopic approach. We aim to evaluate the feasibility, structural, functional and quality of life outcomes of endoscopic technique in middle ear cholesteatoma. Method: This prospective study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital from January 2017 to January 2018 including 32 adult patients who were treated by TEES for middle ear cholesteatoma. Feasibility of endoscopic technique was assessed by the conversion rates, visualization of middle ear structures and complications. Structural outcomes were evaluated in terms of graft uptake at the third month follow-up and presence of residual or recurrent disease. Functional outcomes were evaluated in terms of post-operative air-bone gap closure at third month follow-up. Patient outcomes in terms of post-operative pain, cosmetic score, day of return to daily activities and patient comfort scores were evaluated. The quality of life outcomes were evaluated using chronic ear survey (CES) and short form questionnaire −12 version 2 (SF-12V2) which are disease specific and general quality of life assessment tools respectively. Result: Out of 32 patients, endoscopic intact canal wall mastoidectomy was done for 28 and endoscopic canal wall down mastoidectomy in 4 patients. One (3.1%) patient had to be converted to microscopic technique. Median follow-up period was 32.8 months (9–46 months). There were no post-operative complications in any of our patients. The mean middle ear structural visibility index score was 8.4 ± 1.4 with the use of zero-degree endoscope. Graft uptake rate at third month follow-up was 100%. Two (6.3%) patients had recurrent disease at 6 months follow-up and were treated by revision endoscopic surgery. The air conduction (51.3 ± 20.2 dB vs. 34.5 ± 20.4 dB, p < 0.001), and air-bone gap (33.5 ± 11.1 dB vs. 16.9 ± 11.8 dB, p < 0.001) has been significantly improved. The mean pain score at 0 hours, 6 hours and 24 hours after surgery were 2.5/10, 1.6/10 and 0.75/10 respectively. At the discharge, the mean patient comfort score was 9.3 ± 0.6 out of 10. Mean cosmetic score was 9.3 ± 0.5 at the third month follow-up. There was significant post-operative improvement in the sub-scale and total scores of CES and SF-12V2. Conclusion: Endoscopic approach to middle ear cholesteatoma is feasible and confers excellent structural, functional as well as patient related quality of life outcomes.

N2  - Background: Chronic otitis media with anterior perforation is a challenging condition to treat with a microscope especially if the canal is narrow or has overhang. The endoscope provides the advantage of wide-angle view and transcanal access avoiding postauricular approach and canaloplasty. Objective: To compare the anatomical, functional outcomes, and surgical duration between endoscopic and microscopic type-I tympanoplasty performed for anterior perforation. Materials and methods: A comparative study was conducted. The two groups, the microscopic (MT) and the endoscopic (ET) were created with 50 cases each and underwent type-I tympanoplasty. Results were evaluated at a minimum follow-up of 12 months. Results: The graft uptake rate in MT and ET was 81.8% and 91.3% respectively and was not statistically significant. The mean operative time for MT and ET was 68.68 ± 18.79 min and 61.24 ± 11.18 min respectively which was significant (p-.003). Endoscopic tympanoplasty significantly saved time. The difference in hearing outcomes was highly significant within the groups but not between the groups. Conclusion and significance: The endoscopic tympanoplasty offered superior visualization avoiding postauricular incision and canaloplasty, with morphological and functional outcomes comparable to microscopic tympanoplasty. It offers significantly faster completion of procedure and provides minimally invasive surgery.

N2  - Introduction: Nowadays, there are many options to treat hearing-impaired patients: tympanoplastic surgery, hearing aids and a wide range of implantable devices. Aim: The aim of this study is to present the mid-term audiological and quality of life benefits after the implantation of Osia®, an active piezoelectric bone conduction hearing implant. Material and methods: The state of the tissues in the implanted area, as well as audiological and quality of life results were analyzed at six, nine and twelve months after implantation in a group of four adult patients with bilateral mixed hearing loss (1 after bilateral canal-wall-down mastoidectomy, 2 with chronic simple otitis media and after myringoplasty in the opposite ear, 1 with bilateral otosclerosis and after stapedotomy in the opposite ear). Results: No postoperative complications were found in any of the cases. One year after surgery the mean audiological gain in FF PTA4 (pure tone average for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz) was 52.2 ± 3.5 dB in comparison to the unaided situation, the mean speech understanding with Osia® in quiet was 90 ± 8.2% for 50 dB SPL, 98.8 ± 2.5% for 65 dB SPL and 100 ± 0% for 80 dB SPL, and the mean speech understanding with Osia® in noise was 37.5% ± 23.6 for 50 dB SPL, 93.8 ± 4.8% for 65 dB SPL and 98.8 ± 2.5% for 80 dB SPL. There was also an evident improvement in the quality of hearing as well as in the quality of life, measured by APHAB (Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit) and SSQ (Speech, Spatial and Qualities of Hearing Scale). Conclusions: The Osia® is an effective treatment option for patients with bilateral mixed hearing loss. The mid-term audiological and quality of life results are excellent, but further observations including bigger groups of patients and a longer follow-up are required.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the short-term (postoperative), medium-term (5 years), and long-term (10 and 15 years) audiometric results of patients who underwent stapedotomy and to determine specific factors associated with better postoperative outcomes. Methods: This study is a retrospective case review of 486 ears with surgically confirmed stapes fixation who underwent microscopic small fenestra stapedotomy. Preoperative, postoperative, and medium- and long-term air conduction (AC), bone conduction (BC), and air-bone gap (ABG) were assessed. Postoperative factors associated with better postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Results: At 10- and 15-year follow-ups, ABG, AC, and BC were significantly deteriorated but clinically preserved in comparison with postoperative results. According to a multiple quantile regression, younger age was associated with better postoperative results at 0.25 kHz (p = 0.003) and 4 kHz (p = 0.028) and a smaller preoperative ABG was associated with better audiometric results at 0.25 kHz (p = 0.048), 0.5 kHz (p = 0.001), and 4 kHz (p = 0.001). In addition, younger age (p = 0.001 for AC and p < 0.001 for BC) and preoperative AC PTA (p < 0.001 for AC) were significantly associated with better postoperative AC and BC PTA. Conclusions: Stapedotomy surgery provides short-, medium-, and long-term hearing benefits in our studied cohort. ABG, AC, and BC thresholds obtained after the surgery are clinically preserved in 5-, 10-, and 15-year follow-ups, with an age-expected BC deterioration. Smaller preoperative ABG and younger age were positive predictors for better postoperative ABG. Future research should address long-term subjective and quality of life outcomes.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic ear surgery (EES) has been increasingly adopted to enhance visualization during otologic surgery including pediatric cholesteatoma resection. The purpose of this study is to systematically review the current literature reporting rates of residual cholesteatoma to evaluate outcomes of EES in the pediatric population. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane. STUDY SELECTION: Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations (PRISMA), we systematically reviewed studies that reported outcomes for cholesteatoma surgery in children using the endoscope. Studies were included if they described the use of the endoscope for middle ear surgery and measured outcomes following cholesteatoma resection in pediatric patients. DATA EXTRACTION: Identified articles were assessed for study design, sample size, inclusion of pediatric population, the presence of a comparison group, outcomes measured such as: residual disease rate, recurrent cholesteatoma, audiologic outcome, quality of life measures, and complications. DATA SYNTHESIS: Fourteen articles in the literature discussed cholesteatoma outcomes in children when the endoscope was employed. Residual disease rate ranged from 0 to 22% when endoscope was used for dissection compared with 11 to 55% when endoscope was used for inspection or not at all. A meta-analysis was conducted on 11 studies. There was a significant risk reduction in residual disease rates for endoscopic dissection when compared with microscope (RR = 0.48, 95% CI = 0.37-0.63, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Among the studies included in this review, EES was associated with lower rates of residual cholesteatoma compared with traditional microscopic techniques. Additional prospective studies are needed to further assess these findings.

N2  - Objective: Evaluating postural function in patients with otosclerosis by assessing otoneurological function and balance-related quality of life before and 6 weeks after surgical treatment. Correlations between and clinical features were investigated. Methods: Thirty-three patients affected by otosclerosis underwent otoneurological examination, video Head Impulse Test (vHIT), and static posturography before and after stapedotomy. Quality of life and dizziness-related handicap were screened by means of validated questionnaires. Correlation analysis was performed in order to discover possible relations with audiological pre- and postoperative parameters. Results: A significant improvement in posturographic parameters was found. Correlation analysis yielded a negative correlation between preoperative bone conduction auditory threshold and both vHIT scores and postural performance improvement, evaluated by spectral analysis. Moreover, a positive correlation was also found between improvements in posturographic scores and quality-of-life questionnaires. Conclusion: The study results demonstrated an improvement in postural function and self-reported measures in a cohort of patients with otosclerosis 6 weeks after stapedotomy. The inverse correlation with preoperative auditory levels may reflect lesser chance for balance restoration in cases with worse sensorineural function. Possible implications for daily activities and overall quality of life were suggested by improved self-report questionnaire results. Level of Evidence: 4 Laryngoscope, 130:2448–2454, 2020.

Audiometric assessment was performed pre- and postoperatively. The ChOLE classification was determined intraoperatively and via the preoperative CT scan. HRQoL was assessed pre- and postoperatively using the Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21). Results: A total of 87 patients (mean age 45.2 years, SD 16.2) were included in this study. ChOLE stage I cholesteatoma was found in 8 (9%), stage II cholesteatoma was found in 65 (75%), and stage III cholesteatoma was found in 14 (16%) patients. Postoperatively, the mean air–bone gap (0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz) was significantly smaller than before surgery (14.3 dB vs. 23.0 dB; p = 0.0007). The mean ZCMEI-21 total score significantly decreased after surgery (26.8 vs. 20.7, p = 0.004). No correlation between the ZCMEI-21 total score and both the ChOLE stage and the extent of the cholesteatoma (ChOLE subdivision “Ch”) was found. A trend towards worse HRQoL associated with a poorer status of the ossicular chain (ChOLE subdivision “O”) was observed. The audiometric outcomes were not associated with the extent of the cholesteatoma. The ChOLE subdivision describing the ossicular status showed a strong association with the pre- and postoperative air conduction (AC) thresholds. Further, the ZCMEI-21 total score and its hearing subscore correlated with the AC thresholds. Conclusion: The ChOLE classification does not show a clear association with HRQoL measured by the ZCMEI-21. The HRQoL neither seems to be associated with the extent of the disease nor with the ossicular chain status. Yet, surgical therapy significantly improved HRQoL by means of reduced ZCMEI-21 total scores, which were strongly associated with the AC thresholds. Intraoperative assessment of a cholesteatoma using the ChOLE classification and HRQoL complement each other and provide useful information.

N2  - Introduction: Tympanic membrane perforations might have a negative impact on the patient's quality of life, especially in the pediatric population. Surgery is therefore often required. The most adequate age for surgery remains unclear and is debated in the current literature. The aim of this study was to investigate outcomes of type I tympanoplasty in children and examine the impact of age on surgical outcome. Methods: Retrospective cohort study. All patients under the age of 18 undergoing type I tympanoplasty at Regional Hospital West Jutland, Denmark, from 1/1–2013 to 31/12–2017 had their medical files reviewed. The primary endpoint of interest was tympanic membrane closure rate six months following surgery, i.e. surgical success. Secondary outcomes were air-bone-gap reduction and the correlation between age and surgical success. Results: A total of 180 patients undergoing 197 procedures met the predefined criteria. Age at the time of surgery ranged between five and 17 years. Mean age at the time of surgery was 10.1 years (95% CI 9.1–11.2). Surgical success was achieved in 91,3% of the cases. No correlation between age and surgical success was found. Mean air-bone gap was reduced from 19.8 dB (95% CI 18.5–21.0) preoperatively, to 6.9 dB (95% CI 6.1–7.7) at follow-up, p < 0.05. Air-bone gaps ≤10 dB at follow-up were achieved in 155 of the cases (78.6%). Postoperative infection seemed to increase the risk of surgical failure, RR 2.80 ((95% CI 1.06–7.38), p = 0.037). Conclusions: Type 1 tympanoplasty in children is an effective treatment in terms of achieving an intact tympanic membrane and improved hearing. No correlation could be found between age and surgical success. Postoperative infection influences surgical outcome negatively.

N2  - The aim of our study was to study, using a questionnaire (СОМОТ-15 questionnaire), the level of quality of life of patients with chronic suppurative otitis media before and after tymponoplast. Material and research methods: We examined 60 patients, over 18 years old, with chronic suppurative otitis media. All participants filled out the СОМОТ-15 questionnaire, anamnesis and otoscopy were studied in detail, all patients underwent clinical studies - these are endoscopic and microscopic assessment of ENT organs, as well as audiological studies, which included a tonal audiogram with measurement of the air-bone interval in both ears. Conclusions: Patients with chronic suppurativeotitis media report a decrease in the quality of life associated with a decrease in hearing acuity, and not with disturbing tinnitus or otorrhea. The type of chronic suppurative otitis media (epitympanitis or mesotympanitis) in no way reflects the patient's quality of life. Tympanoplasty significantly improves the patient's quality of life.

N2  - Objectives: Congenital malformations of the ear are associated with esthetic and psychosocial concerns, as well as functional hearing impairment, often requiring numerous surgical procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate national patterns of surgical care and complications in microtia and atresia reconstruction in this population. Methods: A retrospective review was conducted using the 2016 to 2018 American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) pediatric database. Patients with a diagnosis of microtia or atresia undergoing repair were identified using appropriate diagnosis codes. Demographics and postoperative complications were analyzed and compared. Results: A total of 433 cases were identified. The average age at operation was 10 years, with 34.4% being female. Most underwent autologous grafting with skin or cartilage grafts as the primary procedure (78.9%). In addition, 42.5% of the procedures were performed by head and neck surgeons as opposed to plastic surgeons; 5.3% (n = 23) underwent concurrent procedures toward hearing restoration, such as atresia repair, tympanoplasty, bone-anchored hearing aid placement, or cochlear implant placement. Unplanned 30-day reoperation and readmission were reported in 3.0% (n = 13) and 2.1% (n = 9) cases, respectively. Postoperative complications were rare, with 1.8% reporting wound infections (n = 8). Conclusions: Pediatric congenital auricular malformations require substantial health care resources to restore quality of life. Auricular reconstruction is associated with low rates of postoperative surgical complications. Concurrent procedures for hearing restoration at the time of microtia reconstruction may represent an opportunity for improvement and require further evaluation.

N2  - Objective/Hypothesis: Taste disturbances are often seen in patients after middle ear surgery due to the stress received by an unprotected chorda tympani. It has also been reported that loss in tactile sensitivity may accompany this issue. The current study was designed to measure electrical, chemical, and tactile sensitives of several senses involved in oral processing, smell, taste and touch, over time. Study Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: For three time points, one before middle ear surgery and two after operation (about 5 and 23 days), sensitivity thresholds were obtained using electrogustometry (electrical taste), taste strips (chemical taste), Sniffin’ Sticks (smell) and Von Frey Hairs (point-pressure tactile sensitivity). Results: The results show a decline in both chemical and electrical taste responses. Additionally, the electrical taste response showed more sensitivity to deviations and no sign of recovery unlike the chemical taste response. Mechanosensory function of the anterior tongue and olfactory function was not strongly affected by middle ear surgery. Conclusion: Taste responses, but not mechanosensory or olfaction function, are altered after middle ear surgery. Due to the effects that taste loss has on quality of life, gustometry is recommended for this group of patients. Levels of Evidence: 4.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate operative comfort and stress in patients undergoing stapedotomy for otosclerosis under local versus general anesthesia. Material and methods: Consecutive otosclerosis patients managed over a 9-month period responded to 3 validated questionnaires to assess peri- and post-operative comfort: Glasgow Benefit Inventory, Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale and the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale. These results and audiometric data were compared between local and general anesthesia groups. Results: Twenty-one patients were included in the local anesthesia group and 7 in the general anesthesia group, after exclusion of patients with history of otosclerosis surgery. There was no significant inter-group difference on Glasgow Benefit Inventory (P = 0.38) or Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Scale (P = 0.86). Perceived Stress Scale scores were higher in the general anesthesia group (P = 0.038). In total, 67% of patients reported no discomfort under local anesthesia, and 86% were ready to undergo the procedure under local anesthesia again. There were no significant differences in postoperative symptoms, or in air-bone gap ≤ 10 dB (local anesthesia 81%, general anesthesia 71%; P = 0.156). Conclusions: Local anesthesia in otosclerosis surgery did not increase stress or postoperative symptoms compared to general anesthesia. Audiometric results were not affected by type of anesthesia.

N2  - Otosclerosis is a human-specific ear disease characterised by complex bone-remodelling with multifactorial aetiology. It affects the bony labyrinth capsule and consequently fixates the stapes to the oval window rim. The fixation of the ossicular chain leads to a decrease in the middle ear's acoustic impedance-fitting and amplifier function that leads to conductive hearing loss. The process is progressive and when it involves the inner ear structures, it deteriorates the sensorineural function as well. The course of the illness can be prevented or delayed if hearing reconstructive surgery is performed on time. The development of stapes surgery spans the 20th century, and despite the major surgical steps - laid down by Shea and Marquet in the 1960s - are quite conservative, fine adjustments are still being made mainly due to technical progress. Several studies confirm that stapedotomy remained the first-to-offer therapeutic option in otosclerosis. With an adequate surgical technique, significant improvement can be achieved in the air conduction threshold, the air-bone gap may be minimalized or ceased over the speech frequencies, which significantly improves the quality of life of the patients. In this quest, we reviewed the Hungarian and the international literature as well in context with otosclerosis, with special attention to the newest methods in diagnostics and treatment management.

N2  - Introduction Patients with chronic otitis media (COM) often have a long period of suffering, characterised by recurrent otorrhoea, hearing loss, pain and multiple surgeries. The health-related quality of life (HRQOL) plays an increasingly important role in disease assessment. Internationally, a large number of validated questionnairs are used in English. The Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test (COMOT-15) and the Zurich chronic middle ear inventory (ZCMEI-21) are validated and available in German. Methods HRQOL was determined in 83 patients with COM pre- and 6-12 months post-operatively after middle ear surgery with the COMOT-15 and the “Chronic Ear Survey” (CES), “Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire” (COMQ-12) and “Hearing Handicap Inventory For Adults” (HHIA) translated into German. In addition patients were asked to complete all questionnaires post-operatively as they remembered the pre-operative situation. Results In a first step, the questionnaires translated from English were validated. All these questionnaires showed a highly significant improvement (p<0.001) in HRQOL in pre-post comparison. Post-operative HRQOL correlated strongly with postoperative hearing outcome (r=0.5-0.8; p<0.001). Interestingly, the retrospective assessment of health-related quality of life showed a clear shift to more negative values. Conclusion COM patients show an improvement in HRQOL after middle ear surgery. The internationally used questionnaires fulfil the quality criteria after translation. In general, the response shift should also be considered when evaluating the post-operative results.

N2  - Preservation of the chorda tympani is important in middle ear surgery to prevent dysgeusia postoperatively. However, determining the exact course of the chorda tympani before surgery is not always possible, especially in cases with accompanying malformations. In this report, we presented an extremely rare case of bifurcation of the chorda tympani in a 15-year-old male patient. We performed tympanoplasty for a middle ear malformation with conductive hearing loss. During the operation, we noticed and carefully preserved the bifurcated chorda tympani. The patient did not develop dysgeusia postoperatively. Appropriate handling and understanding of the anomalous chorda tympani preserved the patient's sense of taste and hence quality of life.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this prospective, single-subject, repeated measures study was to evaluate the audiological benefit and patient satisfaction with an adhesive, pressure-free bone conduction hearing system (ADHEAR; MED-EL, Innsbruck, Austria) in patients who underwent middle ear surgery with transient hearing loss due to auditory canal tamponade. Methods: Eleven adult subjects suffering from transient conductive hearing loss were enrolled in the study and followed up to 3 weeks after middle ear surgery. Bone and air conduction thresholds were measured pre and postoperatively to evaluate eligibility for enrollment. Postoperative unaided and aided sound-field thresholds, as well as speech tests in quiet and noise were compared to confirm hearing improvement with the hearing system. To determine patient satisfaction, the SSQ12 and a system-specific quality of life questionnaire was administered to all subjects. Results: Speech perception for monosyllables in quiet improved by 46%, with statistical significance for the ADHEAR system compared to the unaided condition after one week. The functional hearing gain improved by 19 dB. Speech perception in noise with the device was − 6.7 dB SNR on average, with a statistically significant improvement of 2.7 dB SNR. The results of the questionnaire showed a high level of patient satisfaction and subjective hearing improvement. No serious skin reactions or other severe complications occurred. Conclusion: As long as the auditory canal is blocked due to tamponade, patients benefit from hearing rehabilitation. This adhesive hearing system is a safe and effective device to treat transient conductive hearing loss and may considerably improve treatment for patients even with short-term hearing loss.

N2  - When evaluating the outcome of reconstructive middle ear surgery, it is insufficient to use only the achieved improvement of audiometric measurement results. Although, as functional parameters, they occupy a central position in the therapeutic assessment of the ear as a sensory organ, they must be supplemented by a number of modern quality control factors. Different perspectives for assessment of quality must be taken into account. What is important from the patient's point of view may not be the same factors as to the physician, while the physician places a high value on factors that are less significant for the medical insurance company. The international otological community, who would like to draw conclusions from middle ear surgery data, might set different criteria altogether for assessing quality of surgery. Hence, we propose to adapt the general concept of quality to middle ear surgery. This must be implemented on different levels and surgical therapy of middle ear diseases must be understood as a process. This means that new aspects must be included in quality assessment, This means that quality assessment must comprise additional aspects, which include a structured description and recording of disease-specific symptoms, findings, and outcome of treatment. Furthermore, in today's world the use of internationally recognized classification systems must be regarded as a quality feature, in order to make results not only publishable but also capable of meta-analysis. Internationally developed and recognized reporting systems are available for this purpose. Their use in routine care not only makes the collected data internationally comparable, but also enables systematic evaluation within the institution for quality description and control. In addition to audiological measurement results, surgical quality indicators are considered. We also focus on emerging complications and the value of systematic and structured evaluation and documentation systems. Validated measuring instruments are already available for patient benefit assessment, the use of which should no longer be limited to scientific studies. In summary, quality assessment of surgery should be extended to include not only the patient as a whole, but also to the therapy process as a whole, incorporating features of structural and process quality.

N2  - Objectives: To analyze health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and audiological results after stapes surgery using a Nitinol Head Prosthesis (NHP). Methods: Study-Design Prospective longitudinal study. Patients Patients undergoing stapes surgery for otosclerosis and stapes reconstruction with a NHP between January 2018 and December 2018 (n = 48). Intervention Audiological measurements preoperatively and at 6 months follow-up as well as two questionnaires assessing HRQoL, i.e., the Stapes Plasty Outcome Test 25 (SPOT-25) and the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Main outcome measures Correlation of pure tone average (4PTA 0.5–3 kHz) with questionnaires assessing HrQOL preoperatively and at follow-up after stapes surgery. Results: Patients showed a significantly reduced air–bone–gap (ABG, 0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz) at the follow up visit (median: 11.3 dB, IQR 5.0–14.4) compared to the preoperative measurements (median 27.5 dB, IQR 21.9–36.3). Disease-specific HRQoL improved significantly in all scales of the SPOT-25 apart from the subscore “tinnitus”. Postoperatively, the subscore “hearing function” correlated well only with the ABG (r = 0.59, p = 0.001). The SPOT-25 and GBI total scores showed a moderate negative correlation (r = − 0.59, p = 0.008). Conclusions: Stapes surgery leads to significant improvements of hearing and the HRQoL. However, correlations between HRQoL questionnaire scores and the audiometric outcomes were inconclusive, indicating that the use of HRQoL measures for the assessment of stapedotomy outcomes to complement objective outcomes should be encouraged.

N2  - Objective: To determine the effect of current smoking status on 30-day postoperative adverse events in patients undergoing otologic surgery. Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Database of the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program from 2006 to 2016. Subjects and Methods: Adult patients undergoing middle ear and mastoid surgery were included. Preoperative smoking status was determined, and adverse events within 30 days of surgery were recorded. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the association between sociodemographic and clinical variables and postoperative adverse events. Population-attributable fractions were then calculated. Results: A total of 10,684 patients who underwent otologic surgery were included, of whom 2036 (19.1%) were smokers. The most commonly performed surgery was tympanoplasty with and without ossicular chain reconstruction, followed by canal wall up tympanomastoidectomy. Adverse events occurred in 221 (2.1%) patients; the most common was superficial wound infections (n = 99, 0.9%). In smokers, the odds ratio for any adverse event was 1.97 (95% CI, 1.42-2.71). The odds ratios (95% CIs) for superficial wound infections, wound dehiscence, and 30-day readmission among smokers were 1.89 (1.32-2.86), 3.92 (1.26-11.60), and 1.84 (1.15-2.87), respectively. The population-attributable fraction for any adverse event in smokers was 15.5%. Conclusions: In patients undergoing otologic surgery, smokers are more likely than nonsmokers to have postoperative adverse events—in particular, wound infections, wound dehiscence, and readmission to hospital.

N2  - Introduction The use of endoscope is rapidly increasing in otological and neuro-otological surgery in the last 2 decades. Middle ear surgeries, including tympanoplasty, have increasingly utilized endoscopes as an adjunct to or as a replacement for the operative microscope. Superior visualization and transcanal access to diseases normally managed with a transmastoid approach are touted as advantages with the endoscope. Objectives The present study aimed to compare the outcomes of endoscopic and microscopic cartilage tympanoplasty (Type I) Methods This was a retrospective comparative study of 70 patients (25 males and 45 females) who underwent type I tympanoplasty between March 2015 and April 2016. The subjects were classified into 2 groups: endoscopic tympanoplasty (ET, n ¼ 35), and microscopic tympanoplasty (MT, n ¼ 35). Tragal cartilage was used as a graft and technique used was cartilage shield tympanoplasty in both groups. Demographic data, perforation size of the tympanic membrane at the preoperative state, operation time, hearing outcome, and graft success rate were evaluated. Results The epidemiological profiles, the preoperative hearing status, and the perforation size were similar in both groups. The mean operation time of the MT group (52.63 ± 8.68 minutes) was longer than that of the ET group (48.20 ± 10.37 minutes), but the difference was not statistically significant. The graft success rates 12 weeks postoperatively were 91.42% both in the ET and MT groups, that is, 32/35; and these values were not statistically significantly different. There was a statistically significant improvement in hearing within the groups, both pre- and postoperatively, but there was no difference between the groups. Conclusion Endoscopic tympanoplasty is a minimally invasive surgery with similar graft success rate, comparable hearing outcomes and shorter operative time period as compared to microscopic use.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To assess long-term results and present experience with a high-porosity hydroxyapatite ceramic for obliterating large open mastoid cavities. STUDY-DESIGN: Cross-sectional cohort study. SETTING: Tertiary academic referral center. PATIENTS: All patients who underwent tympanomastoid surgery for chronic middle ear disease or revision surgery with reduction of an open mastoid cavity using a highly porous hydroxyapatite matrix material (HMM) between May 2005 and June 2013 were assessed for eligibility. Twenty three patients (56.9 ± 18.3 yr) were included. INTERVENTION: Primary middle ear surgery or revision surgery using a HMM. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pure-tone average, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate osseoinduction, osseointegration and presence of cholesteatoma, current quality of life assessed by Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory and change in quality of life post-intervention assessed by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory. RESULTS: Patients were reexamined after a mean follow-up period of 88.3 months (SD 21.4 mo) after obliteration of the open mastoid cavity with HMM. Compared with visit 1, patients showed a significantly reduced ABG at visit 2 (29.22 dB ± 2.71 dB versus 12.77 dB ± 3.46 dB).CT scan was carried out in 21 patients (91%) patients and 17 patients (74%) underwent MRI.Revision surgery was required in a total of 17 cases (74%). In four patients recurrent cholesteatoma was found at follow up. CONCLUSIONS: Poor cavity obliteration, a high rate of revision surgery and difficult differentiation between recurrent cholesteatoma and granulation tissue in CT scan was observed.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Swedish version of the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Methods: A prospective multicenter cohort study was conducted. A total of 123 otosclerosis subjects were included in the study. The subjects were divided in three groups based on the following interventions: (a) stapedotomy without any prior hearing-aid rehabilitation (n = 60); (b) hearing-aid rehabilitation without any prior stapedotomy (n = 33); and (c) stapedotomy with prior hearing-aid rehabilitation (n = 30). Pre- and post-operative pure tone audiometry were measured. The Swedish version of the GBI was completed by the subjects 6 months after the intervention. Test-retest reliability and internal consistency, factor analysis, construct validity, and criterion validity, was assessed. Results: The Swedish version of the GBI was well accepted by the subjects. It showed good psychometric properties with an overall high reliability. Factor analysis resulted in a 5-factor solution explaining 66.6% of the variance where factors 1 and 2 represented the general health domain. Conclusions: Overall, the Swedish version of the GBI showed good psychometric properties. Based on the factor analyses, there is the possibility that the general health domain should be divided in two separate domains: general health and psychosocial health. Level of Evidence: 2c.

N2  - Purpose of reviewTo review pediatric hereditary angioedema for otolaryngologists, with emphasis on articles within the past 12-18 months.Recent findingsBiologic therapies are accepted for adult hereditary angioedema (HAE), but have been studied less for pediatric HAE. Recent literature supports expanded use of biologic agents in pediatrics as acute treatment and prophylaxis. Available agents include plasma-derived C1 esterase inhibitors (C1-INH) (Berinert, Haegarda, Cinryze), recombinant C1-INH (Ruconest), bradykinin B2 receptor inhibitor (Icatibant), and kallikrein inhibitors (Ecallantide and lanadelumab). Of these, only Berinert is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for acute therapy for children under 12 years of age. Ruconest is approved for treatment of acute attacks over age 13. Ecallantide also has FDA approval as acute treatment for age 12 and older, while lanadelumab and Haegarda are prophylactic agents for adolescents. Icatibant lacks FDA approval in patients under 18 years of age. Cinryze has FDA approval only for prophylaxis for children as young as 6 years old.SummaryPediatric HAE is a potentially life-threatening disease. Targeted biologic agents have gained acceptance in treatment of acute attacks, and their use as prophylactic agents is changing the focus of management from acute intervention to preventive management. While intubation or surgical airway management may still be necessary, early intervention or prophylaxis can decrease morbidity and improve quality of life.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to investigate the effect of canal wall up with bony obliteration tympanoplasty (CWU-BOT) on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic otitis media with cholesteatoma by using the chronic otitis media questionnaire 12 (COMQ-12). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of the COMQ-12 of 26 patients who completed the COMQ-12 before and after a CWU-BOT with eradication of cholesteatoma followed by obliteration of the mastoid and paratympanic space with bone chips and bone pâté and reconstruction of the tympanic membrane and ossicular chain. RESULTS: All patients were operated upon in our institute between 2014 and 2017. The median score of the 12 questions was preoperatively and postoperatively calculated, and then compared. A large effect was observed in the total score and the questions about running ear, discharge, and visits to the general practitioner. A medium positive size effect was observed in the questions about hearing in noisy surroundings, discomfort, dizziness, tinnitus, medication use, and the mental aspect of the patient. In the questions about the hearing at home and quality of life and impact on work, we noted a small positive size effect. In 50% of patients, the HRQOL became normal; the remaining 50% improved to a level very close to normal. CONCLUSION: Canal wall up with bony obliteration tympanoplasty (CWU-BOT) showed a clear decrease in the severity of the symptoms, life and work impact, and health care after surgery.

N2  - Purpose of reviewDespite years of research, pediatric ossiculoplasty remains a challenging surgery with numerous variables factoring into successful outcomes. The aim of this review is to summarize recent publications on surgical technique, timing, and reconstruction materials.Recent findingsThe cause behind ossicular discontinuity does not seem to play a role in hearing results after ossiculoplasty; however, revision surgery is associated with worsening outcomes. The status of the ossicles remains an active area of interest, but the data remain mixed in terms of them playing a role in predicting outcomes in adults and pediatric patients. There remains debate regarding the utility of staging the reconstruction and is often undertaken on a case-by-case basis. Other recent publications highlight positive outcomes associated with canal wall-up procedures, titanium prostheses, and partial ossicular reconstruction prostheses. Endoscopic middle ear surgery in ossiculoplasty has been shown to be successful in monitoring and removal of disease and helpful in reconstruction.SummaryPediatric ossiculoplasty remains a challenging yet rewarding procedure. The bulk of publications are retrospective making much of the literature difficult to interpret. There remains a need for prospective and well controlled studies in both adult and pediatric populations.

N2  - Objectives: To compare quality-of-life (QoL) measurements with audiological results after stapes surgery with two different prostheses. Methods: This is a retrospective longitudinal study. All patients required stapes surgery for otosclerosis and ossicular chain reconstruction with either a titanium band prothesis (TBP) or receiving a nitinol head prosthesis (NHP). Intervention was between January 2011 and March 2017 patients received stapes-surgery with either TBP (n = 95) or NHP (n = 50). Audiological measurements at three different time points (preoperatively, early follow up < 3 months, late follow-up > 3 months) were compared and two different QoL-inventories, the Glasgow-Benefit-Inventory (GBI) and the Stapes-Plasty-Outcome-Test-25 (SPOT-25) were investigated postoperatively. The main outcome measures were Pure tone average (PTA) at 0.5, 1, 2, 3 kHz at early and late follow up after stapes surgery were compared and correlated with the subjective benefit on the QoL inventories. The perforation method and the type of surgery were analyzed as potentially influencing factors. Results: All patients showed a significantly reduced air bone gap (ABG 0.5, 1, 2, 3) at the two follow-up visits (visit 2: mean: 13.6 dB, SD 7.7; visit 3: mean: 12.7 dB SD 8.1) compared to preoperative measurements (mean: 28.9 dB, SD 9.9) and subjectively benefitted from stapes surgery (mean GBI score: 21.55; SD 20.60, mean SPOT-25 score: 28.03; SD 18.53). The outcome of the two questionnaires correlated with each other. Neither the hearing-outcome nor the subjective benefit was significantly influenced by the prosthesis, the perforation method or the type of anesthesia. Conclusions: Both prostheses were safe and led to comparable hearing results as well as to subjective benefits in the Health-related-Quality-of-Life (HrQoL). A combination of the two questionnaires is recommendable for postoperative quality control.

N2  - The lack of an appropriately trained global hearing-care workforce is recognized as a barrier to developing and implementing services to treat ear and hearing disorders. In this article we examine some of the published literature on the current global workforce for ear and hearing care. We outline the status of both the primary-care workforce, including community health workers, and specialist services, including audiologists, ear, nose and throat specialists, speech and language therapists, and teachers of the deaf. We discuss models of training health workers in ear and hearing care, including the role of task-sharing and the challenges of training in low and middle-income countries. We structure the article by the components of ear and hearing care that may be delivered in isolation or in integrated models of care: primary care assessment and intervention; screening; hearing tests; hearing rehabilitation; middle-ear surgery; deaf services; and cochlear implant programmes. We highlight important knowledge gaps and areas for future research and reporting.

N2  - Purpose of reviewThe incidence of blast injuries has increased, and the ear is the highest risk organ. Ear injury induced by blast exposure is important in both military and civilian conditions. The permanent hearing loss caused by blast exposure is associated with a decline in the quality of life. In this review, I describe recent therapeutic strategies for each of the ear pathologies caused by blast exposure.Recent findingsFor tympanic membrane perforation after blast exposure, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has been used as a less invasive treatment to repair the tympanic membrane. The closure rates of tympanic membrane perforations treated with bFGF were reported to be comparable to those following conventional tympanoplasty.For sensorineural hearing loss after blast exposure, treatment with neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) or neurotrophin-3, antioxidants, and Atoh1 induction have recently been applied, and some of them were considered for clinical application.SummaryRecent advances of therapeutics for blast-induced hearing loss, based on their pathologies, have been outlined. There are several promising therapeutic approaches for both middle and inner ear disorders after blast exposure; however, further research is needed to establish new treatments for blast-induced hearing dysfunction.

N2  - Background: Stapes surgery is a common method of treatment of otosclerosis, and its effectiveness is reported based on audiometric hearing thresholds. Audiometric tests do not gauge the impact of tinnitus severity and auditory function on quality of life (QOL) after stapes surgery. Objective: To measure self-assessed QOL in otosclerosis patients after stapedotomy in terms of three major factors: change in audiometric hearing threshold, subjective hearing benefit, and tinnitus severity. Method: This prospective clinical study included 191 patients who underwent stapedotomy between April and October 2017 due to otosclerosis. All patients were tested by pure tone audiometry and filled in a questionnaire before surgery and 6 months afterwards. Subjective hearing was assessed with the Abbreviated Profile for Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB); tinnitus severity was established using the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI), and the QOL was measured by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Results: Statistical analysis showed that the average GBI total score (mean = 33.7; SD = 23.7) was statistically significantly higher than zero (t = 19.7; p < 0.001). Based on a regression model, all the three variables studied - audiometric hearing thresholds change, APHAB change, and TFI change - had a significant effect on QOL after stapedotomy. Interestingly, the highest beta value (b = 0.040; p < 0.001) was for TFI change, implying that TFI change had the greatest effect on QOL. Conclusion: Although the improvement of QOL after stapes surgery undoubtedly depended on improvement in both audiometric and self-reported hearing, the reduction of tinnitus severity had the greatest impact on increase in QOL.

N2  - Objective: This study was undertaken to determine the characteristics of congenital cholesteatoma (CC) in Japan, via a nationwide survey using staging and classification criteria for middle ear cholesteatoma, as proposed by the Japan Otological Society (JOS). Methods: A nationwide survey regarding middle ear cholesteatoma treated in 2015 was performed. There were 1787 registrations from 74 facilities, among which, CC accounted for 12.9% (231 cases) of all middle ear cholesteatoma cases. The extent of the disease was classified according to the classification and staging of cholesteatoma proposed by JOS in 2015. Results: The age of the patients ranged from 1 to 55 years (mean, 8.2 years; median, 6 years; 149 ears of males; 82 ears of females). Among these cases, 105 (45.5%) were classified as stage I, 121 (52.4%) as stage II, and 5 (2.1%) as stage III, with no cases in stage IV. In the sub classification of stage I, 35 (33%), 43 (41%) and 27 (26%) ears were classified as stages I-a, I-b and I-c, respectively. Stage I-b (cholesteatoma confined to the posterior half of the tympanic cavity) was more frequent than stage I-a (the anterior half of tympanic cavity). Pre-operative hearing level of air-conduction was 20.5 dB for stage I-a, 34.5 dB for stage I-b, 30.5 dB for stage I-c, 38.6 dB for stage II, and 59.0 dB for stage III. The rate of missing stapes superstructure increased as the disease progressed. In the same way, the mastoid development lowered as the stage of the disease progressed. There were significant differences in the age at operation, pre-operative hearing level, status of stapes, and major ossiculoplasty, between stage l-a and l-b. Conclusions: The current condition of CC in Japan was been evaluated; in particular, it was observed that the cases limited to the posterior part of tympanic cavity were not rare. The JOS stage classification based on the progression of the disease seemed simple and efficient.

N2  - Objectives/Hypothesis: To investigate the simultaneous application of cartilage tympanoplasty combined with eustachian tube (ET) balloon dilatation in the treatment of adhesive otitis media (AdOM). Study Design: Multicenter, prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial. Methods: Patients with AdOM were randomly divided into four groups: control group (conservative treatment), ET balloon dilatation (ETBD) group, cartilage tympanoplasty (CT) group, and cartilage tympanoplasty combined with ET balloon dilatation (ETBD+CT) group. Patients were followed up at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after treatment, receiving otoendoscopy and pure-tone audiometry, and were evaluated using the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), visual analogue scale (VAS) for the symptom of ear stuffiness, Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test (COMOT-15), and eustachian tube scores (ETS). Results: There was no improvement in tympanic membrane (TM) morphology and mean pure-tone air-bone gap (ABG) after treatment in the control and ETBD groups. The postoperative TM morphology was improved in the CT group and ETBD+CT group, although retraction pockets reoccurred in two cases of CT group. Reduced ABG and improvements in ETS, THI, VAS, and COMOT-15 were all achieved in these two groups, but the difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Cartilage tympanoplasty combined with ET balloon dilatation could be used as an appropriate surgical technique for AdOM, which could relieve the symptoms of tinnitus and ear stuffiness, and improve postoperative TM morphology, hearing level, ET functions, and quality of life, with low incidence of complications.

N2  - Implantable auditory devices (IADs) are a viable hearing restoration option for patients with hearing loss. Conditions such as chronic otitis externa, congenital aural atresia, and chronic otitis media can be treated with a variety of implants. Progressive disease are also amenable to restoration with IADs, providing stabilized hearing. When considering the best rehabilitative options, the patient's preference, ease of surgery, ease of device use, quality of life, and the traditional alternatives (such as ossiculoplasty, hearing aids, and cochlear implants) need to be considered. Patients with conductive, mixed, and sensorineural losses, mild to severe in nature, can be candidates for IADs.

N2  - Patients with chronicotitis media (COM) suffer from otorrhoea und hardness of hearing. Spreading over many years and frequently including mutiple surgeries, the course of disease restricts the quality of life of the affected patients. The impact of mental health on disease-spezific QoL has not been researched so far regarding the objectified ear symptoms. 100 patients with COM have been interviewed amongst applying the Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15), Zurich Chronic Middle Ear Inventory (ZCMEI-21) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-D). That has occured preoperatively and 6 month after middle ear surgery. The objectification of the ear symptoms has been shown by pre- A nd postoperatively measured audiometry and by Ossiculoplasty Outcome Staging Index (OOPS-Index). In addition somatic diseases were quantified by Charlson Comorbidity Index. We calculated the impact of depressiveness on disease-specific QoL by multivariate regression analysis. Preoperative depression symptoms were prospectively associated with a worse disease-specific QoL six months after the rehabilitating ear-surgery (COMOT-15 β= 0.45/ZCMEI-21 β= 0.61). This effect stayed statistically significant even after adjustment for the absolute hearing level, the extent of the middle ear pathology as well as the somatic comorbidities (COMOT-15 β= 0.41/ZCMEI-21 β= 0.56). Patients with COM and increased depressiveness show a stronger impairment of disease-specific QoL after ear surgey. Therefore evaluation tools for acquisition of QoL and mental health sould be considered in clinical practice.

N2  - Introduction: chronic suppurative otitis media is a global middle ear disease with quality of life as economic implications, which are wors e felt in low and middle income (LAMI) countries; thus the need for myringoplasty. This study aimed to explore audiological functi on in a group of adults following myringoplasty in South Africa, with an exploration of the possible influence of factors such as HIV/AIDS and type of surgical technique on hearing outcomes. Methods: within a retrospective chart review research design, 41 participant files for a six-year period from two academic hospitals in Johannesburg, South Africa, were reviewed. Data were analysed using both descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: participant files comprised of 16 males and 25 females between 18-63 years. Findings revealed that clinically, overall hearing improved post-operatively, as indicated by improved tympanometry findings, pure tone air-conduction and speech reception thresholds. Descriptively, the predictors of improved hearing outcomes post-operatively appeared to be HIV negative status and butterfly cartilage inlay surgery as a surgical technique adopted. Although clinically, hearing outcomes improved post-operatively at all air-conduction frequencies tested; these clinical improvements were only statistically significant at specific frequencies. Conclusion: current findings provide useful initial evidence on the benefits of myringoplasty from the South African context; particularly because of the HIV/AIDS prevalence and its potential influence on middle ear disease and its management. Prospective efficacy studies with bigger sample sizes are recommended, with early identification strategies for middle ear disease to red uce the need for myringoplasty seriously considered bearing in mind the resource constraints.

N2  - Aim: To compare the outcomes of bucket handle procedure and cartilage tympanoplasty method in treatment of tympanic membrane perforation. Study Design: Cross sectional/observational. Place of Study and Duration: This study was conducted at Department of ENT, Shalamar Medical & Dental College from 1st January 2017 to 30th September 2018. Methods: Total 80 patients of both genders whom had suffered with chronic otitis media with anterior tympanic membrane perforation were included in this study. Patient's ages were ranging from 10 to 50 years. Patients detailed medical history including age, sex, socio-economic status and education were noted after taking informed consent from all the patients. All patients were undergone surgical treatment with two different techniques bucket handle and cartilage tympanoplasty. All patients were equally divided into two group, Group A (Bucket handle) and Group B (Cartilage). Results: Out of all 80 patients, 46(57.50%) were male while rest 42.50% were females. 22(27.50%) patients were ages between 10 to 20 years, 35(43.75%) patients were ages between 21 to 30 years, 15(18.75%) patients had ages 31 to 40 years and 8(10%) patients were ages more than 40 years. 50(62.50%) patients had rural residency while 30(37.50%) patients had urban residency. 32(40%) patients were literate. 40 patients were treated with bucket handle tympanoplasty in which 23 57.50%) were male and 17(42.50%) patients were female and 40 patients with cartilage tympanoplasty with same ratio as bucket handle. Mean PTA was lower in bucket handle as compared to cartilage (P-value 0.025), there is no significant difference found in time identified in term of PTA outcome (p-value 0.458) and SRT (P-value 0.357) in bucket handle and cartilage tympanoplasty. Total postoperative tympanic membrane perforation was found in 11(13.75%) patients in cartilage typanoplasty group and 13(16.25%) patients in bucket handle group. Conclusion: The reconstruction of subtotal or anterior tympanic membrane perforation with bucket handle and cartilage tympanoplasty methods had similar outcomes. There is no major difference was found in hearing improvements in both methods.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: Patients with otosclerosis more often complain about postoperative taste disturbance than patients with chronic otitis media, which seems paradoxical. We aim to investigate if and potentially why this seems to be the case, since the chorda tympani nerve (CTN) is thought to be severely traumatized less frequently during surgery in the former than in the latter. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Department of Otorhinolaryngology at Hospital of Vastmanland, Vasteras, Sweden. PATIENTS: Sixty-five adults undergoing primary middle ear surgery were included. Thirty-seven were operated on for chronic suppurative otitis media with or without cholesteatoma (CSOM) and 28 for otosclerosis. INTERVENTIONS: Middle ear surgery due to otosclerosis or CSOM. Subjective and objective taste measurements and quality of life (QoL) questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Taste was assessed using electrogustometry (EGM) and the filter paper disc (FPD) method before and up to 1 year after surgery. Questionnaires on taste disturbance, including a visual analogue scale (VAS), and QoL were completed before and up to 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: Subjective taste disturbance anytime during the 1-year follow-up were reported by 62 and 46%, respectively. The difference in EGM 1 week after surgery compared with preoperative EGM was significantly greater among CSOM patients than otosclerosis. One year postoperatively, the difference is non-significant. CONCLUSION: Surgery for CSOM causes greater initial and more long-lasting taste disturbances as compared with surgery for otosclerosis. One-year postoperative taste normalizes for both CSOM and otosclerosis patients according to VAS and EGM measurements. No real change in QoL was seen 1-year postoperatively. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 2 evidence is prospective observational research with an experimental design.

N2  - Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of stapes surgery in patients presenting with a preoperative mixed hearing loss (bone conduction thresholds ≥40 dB; 40 < air conduction thresholds (AC) < 85 dB). Patients and Methods: A total of 30 patients (32 ears) with mixed hearing loss who underwent primary stapedotomy were evaluated. Audiometric parameters were assessed before and after surgery. Contralateral thresholds were also reported. The need for a hearing aid (HA) after surgery and its impact on quality of life were also measured. Results: AC and word recognition at 40, 55 and 70 dB were significantly improved after stapes surgery. Only 16.6% of the patients needed an HA after surgery and reported being satisfied with the aid. Conclusion: Stapes surgery improved auditory function in patients with mixed hearing loss, allowing most patients to delay the need for an HA without worsening their quality of life.

N2  - Introduction/Background: Adenosine Deaminase 2 (ADA2) deficiency is an autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease caused by a loss-offunction mutation in Cat Eye Syndrome Chromosome Region Candidate 1 (CECR1) gene encoding for ADA2 protein. Affected individuals may present with immune deficiency, vasculopathy (manifested by recurrent stroke, intracranial hemorrhages, livedo reticularis, or polyarteritis nodosa), pure red cell aplasia, antibody deficiency, and bone marrow failure. Objectives: To present the clinical phenotype of a patient evaluated at the National Institutes of Health with ADA2 deficiency. Methods: Clinical and laboratory features of a patient with ADA2 deficiency, confirmed with Sanger sequencing, evaluated at the National Institutes of Health. Results: A 28-year-old Caucasian male patient presented due to recalcitrant warts of the hands and feet. He had childhood otitis media status post tympanoplasty, mild molluscum contagiosum, and eczema. Also, history of migraines with a negative brain MRI. A trial of weekly pegylated interferon alpha 80mcg for his warts was discontinued due to significant neutropenia and depression. Physical exam was notable for bulky skin colored warts on the lateral and dorsal fingers and dorsal hands including periungual skin. Clusters of verrucae were noted on the feet. Initial laboratory testing was notable for mild hypogammaglobulinemia with protective specific antibodies. Lymphocyte subset analysis revealed a predominantly T cell lymphopenia with decreased naïve and memory CD4 and CD8 subsets, normal absolute numbers of B cells but with low memory subsets, and normal numbers and function of NK cells.Whole exome sequencing ultimately revealed homozygous R169Q mutations in the CECR1, a mutation previously described as causing ADA2 deficiency. ADA2 activity was about 40%. Conclusions: ADA2 deficiency is a relatively newly defined genetic defect, with a clinical phenotype that continues to evolve with newly diagnosed cases. Our patient had not had evidence of vasculitis or stroke, but had recalcitrant warts with lymphopenia as his primary presentation. Approach to therapy for those without vasculitis or significant cytopenias remains unknown.

N2  - Introduction: Patients with chronic otitis media (COM) complain about otorrhoea und hardness of hearina. Spreadina over many years and frequently includina mutiple operations, the course of disease restricts the quality of life of the affected patients. The impairment of mental health can therefore be the consequence. However no data is available so far. Methods: Up to now 70 patients with COM have been interviewed usina the Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-D) preoperatively and 6 month after the middle ear operation. The objectifiability of the patient's disease has been shown by pre- and postoperatively measured pure tone audiometry and by Ossiculoplasty Outcome Staaina Index (OOPS-Index). Results: Patients with COM show an increased depression in comparison to aeneral population. The extent of depression indicates a clear correlation with hearina loss and considerably determines the subjective valuation of the suraical success. Conclusions: COM-Patients with impaired mental health demonstrate an increased reduction of the specific quality of life compared to psycholoaically healthy patient. This has an direct impact on the subjectively perceived postoperative outcome and thus for recordina quality of life and mental health assessment tools in the clinical diaanostics are essential.

N2  - Introduction and aim: In this article, we wanted to evaluate the efficacy of stapes surgery in patients presenting a pre-operative mixed hearing loss (bone conduction (BC) ≥ 40dB; 40dB < air conduction (AC) < 85dB) Material and methods: 30 patients (and 32 operated ears) with mixed hearing loss undergoing primary stapedotomy were evaluated. Audiometric parameters were assessed before and after surgery. Controlateral thresholds were also reported. The need for hearing aid after surgery, and its impact on quality of life were also measured. Results: Air conduction threshold and articulation function (percentage of word recognition score for 40, 55 and 70dB) were significantly improved after stapes surgery. Only 16,6% of the patients needed hearing aid (HA) after surgery and reported to be satisfied with this aid. Conclusion: Stapes surgery improved the auditory function in mixed hearing loss, allowing most of our patients to delay the need of HA without worsening quality of life.

N2  - Introduction and aim: It is commonly known that the chronic otitis media (COM) problems have an impact on the quality of life (QOL) of patients. In this study, we want to investigate the short-term effect of Mercke tympanoplasty with bony obliteration technique (BOT) on the QOL in patients with COM. A few years ago the Dutch COMQ12 was validated. This questionnaire investigates the symptom severity, life and work impact and health impact of COM in the past 6 months. Our goal was to assess patient reported health and impact on work and social life following surgery using a disease specific patient related outcome measure questionnaire. Materials and methods: Patients with COM were asked to complete the COMQ12 pre-operatively, 6 months post-operatively and after 1 year post-operatively. Results: A total of 36 patients were included: 18 men and 18 women. The mean age is 35,24 years. Calculating the median of each question and comparing with the pre-operative group, we notice a decrease of the complaints on all questions. The raw average of the total score of the COMQ12 for the pre-operative, post-operative 6 months and after 1 year post-operatively is respectively 25,58 points, 14,2 points and 11,47 points. The largest decrease is noticeable in the first months after surgery. Conclusion: Using the COMQ12 in our population (Patients with COM and Mercke tympanoplasty with BOT), we have a clear decrease in the severity of the symptoms, life and work impact and health care after surgery.

N2  - Objectives: To assess outcomes following tympanoplasty for blast-induced tympanic membrane perforations in a military population. Study Design: Case series with chart review. Setting: Tertiary care medical centers. Subjects and Methods: Military personnel (N = 254) undergoing tympanoplasty for blast-related tympanic membrane perforations sustained between April 2005 and July 2014 were identified from the Expeditionary Medical Encounter Database. Descriptive statistics were obtained regarding demographics, primary and revision surgery success rates, hearing status pre- and postsurgery, and frequency of ossicular reconstruction. Rates of successful perforation closure were assessed against perforation size and character (central vs marginal) and time to surgery. Rates and types of complications were additionally explored. Results: There were a total of 352 operations among 254 subjects, with an 82.1% rate of successful closure following primary surgery. For successful primary tympanoplasty, the mean improvement in pure tone average was 11.7 ± 12.1 dB. Ossiculoplasty was performed in 9.1% (32 of 352) of cases. There was no significant relationship between successful perforation closure and perforation size, perforation character, or time between injury and surgery. Cholesteatoma complicated 4.3% (15 of 352) of cases. A significant relationship was identified between risk of cholesteatoma development and increasing perforation size and marginal perforations. Conclusion: Tympanoplasty success rates for blast-induced tympanic membrane perforations are lower than for other common injury mechanisms. Due to appreciable rates of postoperative cholesteatoma development, close clinical surveillance is recommended.

N2  - Aim of the present study is to evaluate the long term results of ossiculoplasty using titanium clip prosthesis. A retrospective analysis with prospective follow-up has been done including for all patients who had a Clip-PORP implanted between the years 2002-2013. Following this, audiometric hearing results were measured with clinical examination including otoscopy and quality of life evaluation using Glasgow benefit inventory. 48 patients (51 ears, 29 men, 19 women, average age 44.1 years) received followed up after an average duration of 6.3 years. The overall air-bone-gap (0.5-4 kHz) decreased from 22.8 dB preoperatively to 14.6 dB postoperatively (p≤0.001). The most frequent indication for surgical treatment were cholesteatomas and recurrent cholesteatomas (52%), chronic inflammation of middle ear (12%), revision of radical mastoidectomy (8%) and disturbance in sound conduction after previous operation (14%). Tympanic membrane was closed in 47 times (92,2%), 4 times (7,8%) there was a defect. Clip-PORP was in situ 39 times (75%), protrusion and disposal were detected 6 times (11,8%) and 2 times (4%), respectively. However, 1 time (2%) the prothesis was lost or evaluation was not possible (3 times, 5,9%). The overall patient satisfaction and general subscale score after the treatment was beneficially evaluated. There was no change in social support score nore the physical health score. In summary, the ossicular chain reconstruction using titan Clip-PORP is safe and well established. Also in long-term analysis stable hearing results due to reduction of air bone gap are represented. The subjective quality of life is sustainable improved.

N2  - The aim of this study was to compare the audiologic outcomes of the patients who underwent endoscopy on one ear and microscopic tympanoplasty on the other, and to investigate the operative time, graft success, postoperative pain and health status. This prospective randomized controlled study was carried out in Ege University ENT Department between February 2015 and September 2016. The patients who had bilateral chronic otitis media, normal middle ear mucosa and a hearing loss difference of 10 dB or less between the two ears randomly underwent microscopic tympanoplasty in one ear and endoscopic tympanoplasty in the contralateral ear, with 6-month intervals. 13 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 36.17 ± 3.61 years (range 17–53 years, 7 female, 6 male). The improvement in air–bone gap for groups 1 (endoscopic) and 2 (microscopic) was 9.48 ± 5.23 and 9.89 ± 2.79 dB, respectively. The duration of the surgery in group 1 was significantly lower than that in group 2 (p < 0.01). VAS scores were 2.15 ± 0.37 and 3.76 ± 1.64 cm for groups 1 and 2, respectively (p = 0.006). The endoscopic approach for type 1 tympanoplasty offers shorter surgery time, better health status and lower postoperative pain than microscopic surgery. In addition, endoscopic surgery offers comparable improvement in air–bone gap and similar graft success. The endoscopic approach has comparable audiological and morphological graft outcomes with the microscopic one. The endoscopic approach yielded better health and pain status for the same patients. Level of evidence This is an individual randomized controlled trial. The level of evidence is 1b.

N2  - Introduction: Tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure for chronic perforation closure of the tympanic membrane or ossicular chain reconstruction. The size and location of the drilling depend on the infectious agent, the severity of the infection and its chronicity. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the postoperative results and complications in patients undergoing tympanoplasty in a medical service of otorhinolaryngology residency. Methods: A study was conducted prospectively with patients submitted to tympanoplasty in Otorrinos Hospital in Feira de Santana, Bahia, during the period from 2010 to 2016. The study included patients with chronic otitis media and tympanic membrane perforation, indicating for surgical correction. Patients were followed postoperatively for eight months. Those who not attending the return visits were excluded. Results: We analyzed 207 patients, aged between 10-75 years. of these, 119 (57%) were female and seventeen (8,2%) had wound infection. Regarding the integrity of the tympanic membrane, 59 (28,5%) had residual perforation and 31 (14,9%) reported worsening of hearing at the end of follow-up. Conclusion: chronic otitis media is associated with significant reduction in quality of life in patients with perforation in the tympanic membrane by intermittent frames of otorrhea, however, tympanoplasty surgery is still associated with high complication rate. This depends on the surgeon's skill and use of appropriate techniques, and good follow-up postoperatively.

N2  - Endonasal ballon dilatation of the Eustachian tube (BET) is a promising treatment for Eustachian tube dysfunction with encouraging results over the last years in adults. In addition, in children, single studies demonstrated promising results, but revealed the necessity for broader and additional studies. Our retrospective analysis presents outcomes with BET in children with chronic obstructive dysfunction of the Eustachian tube, showing resistance to the conventional therapy after adenotomy with paracentesis or grommets (ventilation tubes). The data of 52 children, having undergone BET from April 2011 to April 2016, were retrospectively evaluated. Most children in our study presented middle ear effusion (47%), adhesive (21%), chronic otitis media (13%), or recurrent acute otitis media (11%). In 24 (37%) children, we combined BET with a paracentesis, in 5 (8%) patients with a tympanoplasty type I and in 3 (5%) patients with a type III. All children were assessed using an audiogram, tympanometry, and tubomanometry (50 mbar) before and after BET. In addition, we evaluated the results of the Lübecker questionnaire, which we performed before and after BET. The childrens’ ear-related and quality of life-related symptoms, such as pressure equalization, ear pressure, hearing loss, pain and limitation in daily life, and satisfaction pre- and postoperatively, were analyzed. In the majority of patients, we could see an improvement in the ear pressure, hearing loss, limitation in daily life, and satisfaction with recurrent inflammations, underlined by better outcomes in the tubomanometry and the tympanogram. BET in children is a safe, efficient, and promising method to treat chronic tube dysfunction, especially as a second line treatment, when adenotomy, paracentesis, or grommets failed before.

N2  - Objective: To analyse the anatomical, functional and quality-of-life results when using bioactive glass in mastoid and epitympanic obliteration. Design: Prospective clinical study. Setting: Tertiary referral centre. Participants: Forty-one cases (39 patients) operated between May 2013 and January 2015. Main outcome measures: Anatomical results were evaluated by otomicroscopy 1 year after surgery and using imaging to detect residual disease. Functional results were studied by postoperative hearing gain. Quality of life was assessed with the Glasgow Benefit Inventory questionnaire and the success of surgery by a surgery-specific questionnaire. Results: At 1 year, all patients presented a well-healed external auditory canal, with an intact tympanic membrane. In cases with cholesteatoma (n = 23), no recurrent retraction pockets or residual disease were observed on imaging studies. The overall air–bone gap closure was 7.7 ± 1.84 dB (mean ± se of the mean, P < 0.001, paired t-test). No significant differences were found on hearing results when comparing primary versus revision surgery, canal-wall-up versus canal-wall-down obliterations, type of tympanoplasty and presence of cholesteatoma (multifactor anova). The Glasgow Benefit Inventory improved with an average score of 28 and the success of surgery questionnaire showed a significant improvement in ear discharge and a moderate improvement in hearing and equilibrium. Conclusions: The use of bioactive glass for mastoid and epitympanic obliteration in canal-wall-down or canal-wall-up tympanoplasties is an effective procedure in both primary and revision surgery. The anatomical and functional results appear to be well correlated with patient experience and to the improvement in quality of life.

N2  - Conclusion: The incidence of taste disturbance after stapes surgery is high (61.9%), whereas the majority (94.8%) recovers within 1 year. More severe surgical nerve trauma caused more disturbance, implying that the nerve should be handled carefully during surgery. Objectives: Patients operated on for otosclerosis seem more often to complain about post-operative taste disturbance than those operated on for chronic otitis media, although the chorda tympani nerve more seldom becomes maltreated in stapedotomy. These observations seem paradoxical. It is unclear to what extent a post-operative taste disturbance affects the quality-of-life. This study aims to shed light on the occurrence of post-operative taste disturbances, on possible prognostic factors, and to what extent post-operative taste disturbance impairs the quality-of-life. Methods: One hundred and thirty-four adults undergoing primary stapedotomy were included. Questionnaires on taste disturbance and quality-of-life (SF-36) were answered before and after surgery, until 1 year post-operatively. Results: Eighty-three (61.9%) study persons reported post-operative taste disturbance. Seven (5.2%) reported persisting disturbance at 1 year. Surgically more traumatized chorda tympani nerves correlated with more severe taste disturbance post-operatively than less traumatized. Taste disturbance at 1 year post-operatively correlate with a decrease of the physical function domain in the SF-36.

N2  - Aim of the present study is to evaluate the long term results of ossiculoplasty using titanium clip prosthesis. A retrospective analysis with prospective follow-up has been done including for all patients who had a Clip-PORP implanted between the years 2002-2013. Following this, audiometric hearing results were measured with clinical examination including otoscopy and quality of life evaluation using Glasgow benefit inventory. 48 patients (51 ears, 29 men, 19 women, average age 44.1 years) received followed up after an average duration of 6.3 years. The overall air-bone-gap (0.5-4 kHz) decreased from 22.8 dB preoperatively to 14.6 dB postoperatively (p≤0.001). The most frequent indication for surgical treatment were cholesteatomas and recurrent cholesteatomas (52%), chronic inflammation of middle ear (12%), revision of radical mastoidectomy (8%) and disturbance in sound conduction after previous operation (14%). Tympanic membrane was closed in 47 times (92,2%), 4 times (7,8%) there was a defect. Clip-PORP was in situ 39 times (75%), protrusion and disposal were detected 6 times (11,8%) and 2 times (4%), respectively. However, 1 time (2%) the prothesis was lost or evaluation was not possible (3 times, 5,9%). The overall patient satisfaction and general subscale score after the treatment was beneficially evaluated. There was no change in social support score nore the physical health score. In summary, the ossicular chain reconstruction using titan Clip-PORP is safe and well established. Also in long-term analysis stable hearing results due to reduction of air bone gap are represented. The subjective quality of life is sustainable improved.

N2  - Introduction and aim: To define clinically relevant outcome indicators for surgical interventions in otological pathologies with respect to objective and subjective measures. More specifically, to evaluate evidence correlating Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM) to objective audiological and other functional measures. Materials and methods: Literature review of the English literature up to 2015 with regard to Medline and Cochrane. Outcome indicators related to several otological surgical procedures were listed and evaluated. So far, included procedures were stapedotomy, chronic otitis media (COM)/cholesteatoma surgery. Results: As reported, the most relevant outcome indicators for otosclerosis were air conduction thresholds and air bone gap (ABG) on pure tone audiometry, (PTA) and general Health Related Quality of Life (HRQL) measures such as the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). Complication rate is not frequently used in assessing outcome for otosclerosis. In COM with/without cholesteatoma there is a lack of uniformity in the reported audiological measures. The outcome in COM is largely patient oriented; otorrhea, for example, has a big impact on HRQL and is often used as outcome indicator. The Chronic Ear Survey (CES) seems to be the most used disease-specific PROM for COM. Conclusions: Lack of uniformity in both objective and subjective measures makes study comparison difficult. Although usually no clear-cut correlation between surgeon's objective measures and patient's subjective reported benefit could be found, none of them can be dismissed as useless. Further studies will be needed.

N2  - Introduction and aim: Myiasis is the infestation of live humans (or animals) by fly larvae. Although the diagnosis of aural myiasis is relatively straightforward, no consensus is available on what the optimal treatment is. Predisposing factors are chronic otitis media, low socioeconomic status, swimming in stagnant water, diabetes mellitus, old age, mental retardation, and poor personal hygiene. Case report: A 65-year-old patient presented with otorrhea, itchiness, pain and a murmur in the right ear since a couple of days. No facial weakness was reported or observed. The patient had poor personal hygiene and underwent chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery for an ipsilateral parotid malignancy several years ago. Inspection of the right ear showed larvae behind the auricle exiting through a fistula. Otoscopic examination revealed larvae in an inflamed external auditory canal, with bony sequestration, granulation tissue in the middle ear with no identifiable tympanic membrane or ossicles. A CT scan was performed and demonstrated erosion and sequestration of the anterior and posterior bony wall of the external ear canal and dehiscence towards the tegmen tympani opacification throughout the mastoid and middle ear. Via a retroauricular incision extending superiorly over the temporalis muscle, a canal-wall-down mastoidectomy was performed with resection of the larvae, necrotic bony sequesters and affected mucosa. Only a mobile stapes was found in the middle ear. Temporalis fascia was used for canal-wall-down tympanoplasty. Because the mastoid had already been irradiated, the mastoid was obliterated with a pedicled temporalis muscle, also used for fistula reconstruction. Postoperative treatment consisted of amoxicillin-clavulanic acid in therapeutic dosage and topical treatment with a terramycine and hydrocortisone suspension. No recurrence was observed at last follow-up available, 4 months after surgery. Conclusion: Aural myiasis is a rare but potentially lethal condition because of the risk of intracranial penetration. The treatment in early manifestations consists of removal of the larvae and irrigation of the ear. Prophylactic broad spectrum antibiotics are prescribed to prevent secondary infections. Surgical treatment is indicated if the disease extends in the middle ear and mastoid cavity.

N2  - Objective: The occurrence of persistent infection following tympanoplasty has been reported in many studies, and it is important to know the risks for site infection after tympanoplasty. In this study, we aimed to explore the factors affecting early wound complications after tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the Diagnosis Procedure Combination database. Data on a total of 13,094 adult patients from 420 acute-care hospitals who received tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media from 2010 to 2013 were extracted. The duration (days) of postsurgical local wound treatment was measured as an outcome, because this duration was assumed to be prolonged by the existence of wound infection. The associations between treatment duration and background characteristics (age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, use of antithrombotic agents, with or without cholesteatoma, duration of anesthesia, academic hospital or not, and hospital volume) were assessed by multivariable linear regression analyses, fitted with a generalized estimating equation to adjust for within-hospital clustering. Results: The median treatment duration in each hospital was 8 days (interquartile range: 7-11). Factors significantly associated with longer treatment duration were: older age (0.2 days for 10-year increase), use of antithrombotic agents during hospitalization (1.8 days), and prolonged duration of anesthesia (vs. <120 min of anesthesia, additional 1, 2, 3, and 4 days for 120-179, 180-239, 240-299, and ≥300 min of anesthesia, respectively). Body mass index and smoking status were not significantly associated with treatment duration. Conclusions: Older age, antithrombotic agents during hospitalization, and longer anesthesia time were independently associated with early local wound complications after tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media.

N2  - Introduction: Tympanoplasty is a surgical procedure for chronic perforation closure of the tympanic membrane or ossicular chain reconstruction. The size and location of the drilling depend on the infectious agent, the severity of the infection and its chronicity. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the postoperative results and complications in patients undergoing tympanoplasty in a medical service of otorhinolaryngology residency. Methods: A study was conducted prospectively with patients submitted to tympanoplasty in Otorrinos Hospital in Feira de Santana, Bahia, during the period from 2010 to 2015. The study included patients with chronic otitis media and tympanic membrane perforation, indicating for surgical correction. Patients were followed postoperatively for eight months. Those who not attending the return visits were excluded. Results:We analyzed 144 patients, aged between 10-75 years. Of these, 89 (62%) were female and 4 had wound infection. Regarding the integrity of the tympanic membrane, 46 (32%) had residual perforation and 21 (15%) reported worsening of hearing at the end of follow-up. Conclusion: Chronic otitis media is associated with significant reduction in quality of life in patients with perforation in the tympanic membrane by intermittent frames of otorrhea, however, tympanoplasty surgery is still associated with high complication rate. This depends on the surgeon's skill and use of appropriate techniques, and good follow-up postoperatively.

N2  - Learning Objectives: To inform about the results of the use of S53P4 bioactive glass for obliteration of the mastoid cavity in cholesteatoma surgery. To demonstrate the advantages and limitations of the technique. Introduction: Mastoid obliteration has been reported to reduce the number of recurrences and improve the quality of life in both canal wall up (CWU) and canal wall down (CWD) procedures, in the treatment of cholestatoma. Confronted with a rather high recurrence rate after CWU surgery without obliteration, we implemented the use of S53P4 bioactive glass (BonAlive). Our choice was madedue to the unlimited availability and the alleged antibacterial, osteoconductive and osteopromotive properties. Here we report on the safety and efficacy of the use of S53P4 as obliteration material in cholesteatoma surgery. Methods: Retrospective cohort study carried out in a secondary referral center. All patients were treated for cholesteatoma with tympanomastoidectomy and mastoid cavity obliteration using S53P4 granules between 2012 and 2015. Main outcome measures were procedure safety, cholesteatoma recurrence, and functional outcome (hearing levels and incidence of otorrhea). Results: One hundred eleven patients (111 ears) were included. Mean age was 36 years (range 7-80). Eighteen patients were treated with canal wall up tympanoplasty. Ninety-three patients underwent a canal wall down procedure. Mean follow-up was 12.6 months. No wound infections occurred. Cholesteatoma recurrence was 9% (CWU: 17%, primary CWD: 8%, revision CWD: 0%). A dry ear was achieved in 96% of patients. No cases of perceptive hearing loss were encountered. Preparing and implanting the S53P4 granules was technically feasible. Conclusions: S53P4 bioactive glass granules are safe and easy to use as a filler material in mastoid obliteration. Obliteration of the mastoid cavity with S53P4 granules resulted in less recurrences as compared to our previous results without obliteration.

N2  - Learning Objectives: Auditory test battery. Hearing result of the ear surgery is important for the quality of life of the patients. Pure tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and the Eustachian tube function test are done for cholesteatoma patients and chronic otitis media ear patients in our hospital. We studied the preoperative and postoperative hearing result of the patients from the view point of quality of life. Case: 75 year-old female. She had the drained ear on both side from her childhood. She noticed hearing impairment when she was 74 years old. She also had discharge of the ear and visited ENT doctor. She was diagnosed that she had chronic otitis media ear on both side and ENT doctor recommended her surgical intervention. She visited our hospital. She had large perforation on both side and the pure tone audiometry showed mixed hearing loss on both side. Pure tone average was 38.3 dB on right ear and 63.8 dB on left ear. The speech audiometry showed 100% (60 dB) on the right and 100% (100 dB) on the left. The Eustachian tube function were normal. Tympanoplasty was done on the right ear first and on the left ear half year after. The pure tone average improved to 20 dB on the right ear and 30 dB on the left ear. She used the hearing aid for the left ear before the operation, but not used it after the operation. It shows the patient does not have the handicap in dairy conversation. Hearing improvement affect not only the dairy life activity but social life activity.

Objective: To evaluate the long-term results and predictive factors of a good outcome with the use of a total ossicular replacement prosthesis in pediatric cholesteatoma surgery. Design and setting: Retrospective case review in a tertiary referral center. Patients: The study included 114 children (116 ears). Interventions: A total of 116 ears underwent total ossicular chain reconstruction with a titanium prosthesis. Cartilage was always used for tympanic membrane reconstruction. Main Outcome Measures: Audiological results were evaluated according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Predictive factors of audiological results were determined. Logistic regression and X2 tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age at surgery was 9.8 years. Ossiculoplasty was performed during second-look surgery in 91 ears (78.4%) and during another stage in 25 ears (21.6%). The first-stage procedure was always performed for cholesteatoma. Audiometric results were available for 116 ears at 1 year, for 89 ears (76.7%) at 2 years, and for 42 ears (36.2%) at 5 years. Closure of the average air-bone gap (ABG) to within 20 dB was achieved in 65 ears (56%) at 1 year. The mean (SD) preoperative and postoperative (at 1 year) ABGs were 41.0 (9.5) dB and 22.4 (12.6) dB, respectively. There were no cases of extrusion, but 17 luxations of the prosthesis were confirmed by computed tomography. Luxation occurred on average at 31.4 months. Three 4000-Hz degradations of bone conduction were reported, with no dead ears. We examined 3 predictive factors of auditory results: preoperative ABG, footplate status, and postoperative otoscopic findings. Conclusions: Total ossiculoplasty is a reliable technique in children. Long-term hearing outcomes are stable and satisfactory, but luxation can occur at any time. Preoperative ABG and footplate status are negative predictive factors of auditory results.

N2  - Introduction: A common problem with canal-wall down mastoidectomy procedures is a discharging cavity. Many techniques for mastoid obliteration to reduce the cavity size have been described. Different biomaterials have been tried on the basis that they should be non-resorbable, non-reactive and integrate. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Serenocem granules, a glass ionomeric cement, as a suitable biomaterial for mastoid obliteration and to review its longterm effects. Methods: 16 patients with chronically discharging mastoid cavities were selected for mastoid obliteration. The subsequent procedures were performed between 2001 and 2003.The two main outcome measures were the number of attendances for aural care and the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI). A secondary measure was the comparison of pre-and post-operative hearing thresholds.These patient were assessed in 2006 providing a minimum of 3 years follow up. As a result of recent chance finding following late revision surgery, a further review of implanted patients was undertaken in 2015/16. Results: The need for aural care reduced in all but one patient. There was a significant difference in the number of aural visits pre and post operation.Benefit in quality of life was assessed using the GBI. In only one patient was there a negative score. The mean values indicate that there has been a positive benefit in quality of life. Complete pure tone average results were available for 13/16 patients. In 8/13 patients the hearing was improved, as intended by additional ossiculoplasty procedures. Of importance a reduction of hearing was noted in only 5 patients, the worst of which was 7.5 dB for the 4-tone average. Conclusions: The initial results of this techniquewere promising, however, the recent chance review of one of these patients showed the granules may be inducing bone lysis in. All patients have been reviewed and the results will be presented.

N2  - Introduction: This study reviews the cases of stapedotomy and evaluates its effectiveness at improving hearing loss in patients with otosclerosis. Materials and methods: Retrospective review of patients’ records who had clinical and audiometric diagnosis of otosclerosis from January to December 2012 Results: A total of 54 stapedotomy surgeries (52 unilateral and 1 bilateral surgeries) were received. Average post-operative ABG for 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 KHz showed that 61.1% had complete closure of ABG (ABG < 10 dB) compared with 1.6% preoperatively and 85.2% had closure of ABG to within 20dB compared with 4.7% preoperatively (t – 13.89, p = 0.000). More than 94% had hearing improvement and 81.5% had ABG closure greater than 10 dB postoperatively (mean gain 23.38 ± 12.37, t = 13.89, p = 0.000). A total of 13% complications were recorded with TM perforation (5.6%) being the commonest complication. Conclusion: Stapedotomy is an effective surgical procedure for the treatment of otosclerosis which leads to improvement in patients’ quality of life. A favorable hearing outcome can be obtained by the combination of experienced hands with minimal surgical trauma and appropriate surgical technique.

N2  - Objective: To investigate the outcomes of tympanoplasty in elderly (≥60 years) compared with young patients (18-59 years). Materials and methods: Patients who had been performed type I tympanoplasty between 2009 and 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. Preoperative and postoperative audiological results and the graft success of 42 older patients were compared with those of 72 younger ones. Results: The mean preoperative air conduction levels were statistically significantly higher in older group (57.4 ± 16.8 dB) than younger group (37.3 ± 10.3 dB) (< 0.001). Preoperative bone conduction levels were statistically significantly higher in older group (28.5 ± 13.4 dB) than in the younger group (12.4 ± 4.8 dB) (< 0.001). The mean preoperative and postoperative air-bone gaps were statistically significantly larger in the older group (28.5 ± 11.0 dB, 16.4 ± 9.0 dB) than in the younger group (24.9 ± 7.7 dB, 12.4 ± 8.0 dB respectively) (< 0.001). The intragroup comparisons of preoperative and postoperative mean air-bone gaps revealed statistically significant improvements in both groups (< 0.001 for both). Graft success rates and the mean hearing gains were not statistically significantly different between the groups (p = 0.225, p = 0.786 respectively). Conclusion: Although preoperative and postoperative air and bone conduction levels were worse in the older group, graft take rates and postoperative hearing gain did not differ between the groups. If the physical status is stable tympanoplasty procedure can be recommended for elderly patients.

N2  - Canal wall down mastoidectomy is one of the most effective treatments for cholesteatoma. However, it results in anatomical changes in the external and middle ear with a negative impact on the patient’s quality of life. To provide complete closure of the mastoid cavity and normalize the anatomy of the middle and external ear, we used human multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs), GMP grade, in a guinea pig model. A method for preparing a biomaterial composed of hMSCs, hydroxyapatite, and tissue glue was developed. Animals from the treated group were implanted with biomaterial composed of hydroxyapatite and hMSCs, while animals in the control group received hydroxyapatite alone. When compared to controls, the group implanted with hMSCs showed a significantly higher ratio of new bone formation (p = 0.00174), as well as a significantly higher volume percentage of new immature bone (p = 0.00166). Our results proved a beneficial effect of hMSCs on temporal bone formation and provided a promising tool to improve the quality of life of patients after canal wall down mastoidectomy by hMSC implantation.

N2  - Background: Otosclerosis is characterized by bony deposits in the otic capsule, resulting in stapes fixation and progressive hearing loss. It can be treated effectively by surgically removing (part of) the stapes and replacing it with a prosthesis. Increasingly, stapes surgery is performed as a day-case procedure. The major drive towards day-case surgery has been out of economic considerations. However, it is also increasingly an explicit patient request and leads to shorter waiting times for surgery, a reduced risk of infection and most likely positively influences the patient's quality of life as a result of rapid discharge and rehabilitation. Even though stapes surgery seems well suited to a day-case approach, given the low complication rates and early recovery, evidence is scarce and of low quality. Methods and design: A single-center unblinded randomized controlled trial was designed to (primarily) investigate the effect of hearing outcomes of day-case stapes surgery compared to inpatient stapes surgery and (secondarily) investigate the effect of both methods on quality of life, tinnitus, vertigo and costeffectiveness. One hundred and twelve adult otosclerosis patients who are eligible for stapes surgery will be randomly assigned to either the day-case or inpatient treatment group. The primary and secondary outcome measures will be assessed using pure-tone audiometry (at approximately 2 months and 1 year follow-up), questionnaires (at 3 months and 1 year follow-up) and costs diaries (weekly the first month after which once a month until 1 year follow-up). Discussion/conclusion: This trial allows for a comparison between day-case and inpatient stapes surgery to investigate the hypothesis that day-case stapes surgery is associated with a higher quality of life and higher cost-effectiveness, while maintaining equal hearing results, compared to inpatient stapes surgery.

N2  - Introduction The objectives of mastoidectomy in cholesteatoma are a disease-free and dry ear, the prevention of recurrent disease, and the maintenance of hearing or the possibility to reconstruct an affected hearing mechanism. Canal wall down mastoidectomy has been traditionally used to achieve those goals with greater or lesser degrees of success. However, canal wall down is an aggressive approach, as it involves creating an open cavity and changing the anatomy and physiology of themiddle ear andmastoid. A canal wall up technique eliminates the need to destroy the middle ear and mastoid, but is associated with a higher rate of residual cholesteatoma. The obliteration technics arise as an effort to avoid the disadvantages of both techniques. Objectives Evaluate the effectiveness of the mastoid obliteration with autologous bone in mastoidectomy surgery with canal wall down for chronic otitis, with or without cholesteatoma. Data Synthesis We analyzed nine studies of case series comprehending similar surgery techniques on 1017 total cases of operated ears in both adults and children, with at least 12 months follow-up. Conclusion Mastoid Obliteration with autologous bone has been utilized for many years to present date, and it seems to be safe, low-cost, with low recurrence rates-similar to traditional canal wall down procedures and with greater water resistance and quality of life improvements.

N2  - The objective of this study was to compare health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after sequential cholesteatoma surgery including exclusively transcanal technique (ETC), combined transcanal transmastoidal technique (TCM) and canal wall down surgery with obliteration (CWD). It was a clinical case study conducted in a tertiary referral center. 97 patients at least 12 months after cholesteatoma surgery were included. Interventions included sequential cholesteatoma surgery with ETC, TCM or CWD; ossiculoplasty with partial and total ossicular replacement prostheses. HRQOL assessed by Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 including an overall score and three subscores (‘ear symptoms’, ‘hearing function’ and ‘mental health’) as well as a general evaluation of HRQOL and the frequency of physician consultations, audiometric outcome related to HRQOL were the main outcome measures. Patients, who had undergone sequential cholesteatoma surgery, showed moderate restrictions in HRQOL postoperatively. Stratified for the three surgical techniques, patients receiving ETC tended to report lower restrictions in HRQOL. The ETC group offered a significantly lower value in the subscore ‘ear symptoms’. The ‘hearing function’ was attributed to be the most restriction criteria for all techniques. The overall score and all subscores correlated moderately with the postoperative air conduction threshold. The strongest correlation coefficient was achieved for the subscore ‘hearing function’ (rs = 0.49, p < 0.001). Sequential cholesteatoma surgery offers acceptable moderate restrictions in HRQOL postoperatively. Patients receiving canal wall down surgery with obliteration showed equivalent limitations in HRQOL compared to closed techniques (ETC, TCM). The postoperative air conduction threshold was shown not to be a sufficient indicator for HRQOL. Therefore, disease-specific validated and reliable measuring instruments for HRQOL should be transferred from clinical research to clinical practice to provide an individualized postoperative assessment after cholesteatoma surgery.

N2  - For several centuries silver is known for its antibacterial effects. The middle ear is an interesting new scope for silver application since chronic inflammations combined with bacterial infection cause complete destruction of the fragile ossicle chain and tympanic membrane. The resulting conductive deafness requires tympanoplasty for reconstruction. Strategies to prevent bacterial growth on middle ear prostheses are highly recommended. In this study, rabbits were implanted with Bioverit® II middle ear prostheses functionalized with silver containing dense and nanoporous silica films which were compared with pure silica coatings as well as silver sulfadiazine cream applied on nanoporous silica coating. The health status of animals was continuously monitored; blood was examined before and after implantation. After 21 days, the middle ears were inspected; implants and mucosal samples were processed for electron microscopy. Autopsies were performed and systemic spreading of silver was chemically analyzed exemplarily in liver and kidneys. For verification of direct cytotoxicity, NIH 3T3 cells were cultured on similar silver containing silica coatings on glass up to 3 days. In vitro a reduced viability of fibroblasts adhering directly on the samples was detected compared to cells growing on the surrounding plastic of the same culture dish. In transmission electron microscopy, phagocytosed silver silica fragments, silver sulfadiazine cream as well as silver nanoparticles were noticed inside endosomes. In vivo, clinical and post mortem examinations were inconspicuous. Chemical analyses showed no increased silver content compared to controls. Mucosal coverages on almost all prostheses were found. But reduction of granulation tissue was only obvious around silver-coated implants. Single necroses and apoptosis in the mucosa were correlated by intracellular accumulation of metallic silver. For confirming supportive healing effects of middle ear implants, silver ion aggregates need to be tested in the future to optimize biocompatibility while assuring bactericidal effects in the middle ear.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the objective and subjective long-term binaural benefits of surgical correction in children with unilateral congenital aural atresia, using an open-set sentence test in noise and subjective questionnaires.
DESIGN: A prospective study was performed between August 2010 and February 2013. This study included pediatric patients who had unilateral conductive hearing loss (normal bone conduction hearing) on the atretic side but normal air conduction hearing on the normal side and were scheduled to undergo a primary canaloplasty. Pure-tone audiometry, the hearing in noise test (HINT), and questionnaires (Sound-Spatial-Qualities of Hearing Scale; Glasgow Benefit Inventory [GBI]) were administered preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively.
RESULTS: Among 34 consecutive patients who initially met enrollment criteria, 26 subjects (23 boys and 3 girls) aged 10 to 16 years (mean 12.3 years) completed this study. Canaloplasty and hearing restoration procedures were performed uneventfully in all patients. The mean air conduction thresholds were significantly improved from 63.9 to 35.0 dB (6 months) and 39.4 dB (12 months) after surgery (p < 0.001). In HINT, speech understanding in noise that was presented toward the newly opened atretic ear significantly improved at 1 year postoperatively (p = 0.014). In noise toward the normal ear, speech understanding significantly improved after surgery, from -0.1 dB preoperatively to -2.0 dB at 6 months (p = 0.002) and -1.8 dB at 12 months (p = 0.005) (p for quadratic trend = 0.036). The composite score improved from -2.6 dB preoperatively to -3.4 dB at 6 months and -3.6 dB at 12 months (p = 0.045; p for linear trend = 0.005). The Sound-Spatial-Qualities of Hearing Scale scores in all domains significantly improved 1 year after surgery (p < 0.034). The mean GBI scores in each domain ranged from 14.2 to 49.4. Total GBI score was correlated with better signal to noise ratio in noise toward the atretic ear as measured by HINT at postoperative 1 year (Spearman ρ = 0.482, p = 0.013).
CONCLUSIONS: Teenaged patients with unilateral congenital aural atresia showed satisfactory hearing improvement after canaloplasty with hearing restoration surgery. In a serial long-term follow-up, speech understanding in noise measured by HINT improved over time. One year after surgery, teenaged children acquired binaural hearing (binaural squelch), as measured by the HINT with noise presented to the newly opened atretic ear. Subjective questionnaires also showed improvements in binaural hearing function and quality of life.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the audiological, surgical, quality of life, and quality of sound outcomes in adults with open cavities implanted with the Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) implant using round window (RW) vibroplasty approach.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
SETTING: Otolaryngology department, tertiary referral hospital.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Twelve adult patients with conductive or mixed hearing loss, all with previous middle ear surgery, underwent RW vibroplasty in an open cavity. Compound action potential thresholds were assessed during surgery. Surgical complications were recorded. Subjective benefit was evaluated using the Nijmegen Cochlear Implant Questionnaire (NCIQ), Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI), and Hearing Implant Sound Quality Index (HISQUI29) tests.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 42 months (range 12-76). There was no significant change in bone conduction thresholds after surgery. Mean functional gain was 34.3 dB and speech discrimination score at 65 dB significantly improved from 14 to 83%. Extrusion of the wire link was the main surgical complication in four patients. All NCIQ domains improved after surgery. All patients had a positive overall GBI score (mean 35.0). Mean HISQUI29 score was 152.8, on average the quality of sound being defined as "very good."
CONCLUSION: VSB is an effective method of hearing restoration for adults with open cavities suffering from conductive or mixed hearing loss. Intraoperative electrocochleography may be considered of significant help to check the coupling to the inner ear. The high rate of extrusion suggests that middle ear obliteration may be considered in these patients.

N2  - Introduction: The ear malformations are anomalies that occur in embryonic development period and may affect the external ear, middle and/or internal, may be unilateral or bilateral. Hearing loss is one of the most common clinical findings in these patients. This hearing impairment reduces speech intelligibility, compromises the language and consequently the quality of life of this population. Treatment consists of performing surgery and/or adjust the hearing aid. The Vibrant Soundbridge (VSB) is a partially implantable middle ear prosthesis, indicated for patients with sensorineural hearing loss from severe to moderate, and conductive or mixed hearing loss. There are several factors that influence different dimensions related to the use of electronic devices that can be measured by means of tools for assessment of the individual satisfaction. Objective: Check the satisfaction using the Vibrant Soundbridge (SVB) through the questionnaire SADL (Satisfaction with Amplification in Daily Life) in adolescents with ear malformations. Methods and Results: The questionnaire SADL was applied in three adolescents with ear malformations, semi implantable prosthesis users, the VSB. The SADL is a questionnaire that checks the level of hearing aid user satisfaction, consisting of 15 questions divided into four subscales: positive effects, services and costs, negative factors, personal image. Results: The average global score-20, positive effects-6,7, negative aspects-4.3, service and costs-5.1, personal image-3.7. Conclusion: The sample shows satisfaction with the use of VSB.

N2  - Objectives: Determine whether the outcome of tympanoplasty in preschool children is different from that of older children. Study design: Retrospective case series. Methods: Retrospective review of children having undergone a primary tympanoplasty by 4 surgeons for a tympanic membrane perforation between 2002 and 2013. Results: Data from 50 children age 2-4, 130 children age 5-7 and 105 children age 8-13 years old were reviewed. Median follow-up was 7.5 months. On crude analysis, the incidence of anatomical success was not significantly different between the different age groups (p= 0.38), the success rate was respectively 69.4%, 68.5% and 79.1% with an overall rate of 72.5%. 5.9% of all children required later insertion of tympanostomy tubes, 10.2% in preschool children. The post-operative audiology results were similar for all groups with a mean improvement of 9. dB in the air-bone gap. When limiting the analysis to the 155 children having at least 6 months of follow-up, the rate of success was respectively 50.0%, 60.8% and 74.0% (p=0.10). After multivariate analysis controlling for the effect of surgeon, approach and etiology, the odds ratio of perforation was respectively 5.48, 2.27 and 1.00 for the different age groups. Conclusion: Children younger than 4 years of age have the worst outcome after tympanoplasty. It remains uncertain whether the benefits of hearing improvement and quality of life may outweigh that of a high rate of a residual, usually smaller, perforation. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these results and delineate the patient characteristics and technique most likely to lead to successful results.

N2  - The peatland forests of Borneo are characterized by overall low and unpredictable fruit production. Previous work at the Tuanan Orangutan Research Station (TORP) in Central Kalimantan has demonstrated that orangutans prefer fruit and fallback on low energy foods during episodes of fruit scarcity. However, we have little understanding of how they balance and prioritize nutrients in relation to fruit availability, and how macronutrient intake influences orangutan physiology. Because orangutans are frugivores, we hypothesized they would more tightly maintain their target intake of protein (P) than non-protein energy (nPe) when ecologically constrained to eat an imbalanced diet (“protein prioritization”). We used rightangle mixture triangles to examine the relationships among physiological indicators of energetic status, health, and macronutrient intake during episodes of fruit scarcity. Data were compiled from 2,233 full-day focal follows on 49 habituated orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus wurmbii) totaling over 39,000 hours of observations. We found a negative relationship between fruit availability and the P:nPe ratio (p<0.05), and P intake was maintained more tightly than non-protein intake, a pattern that is consistent with protein prioritization. Orangutans at Tuanan frequently fell into a negative energy balance state, as evidenced by urinary ketone production, and lower levels of C-peptides, particularly when nPe intake was low. However, orangutans maintained a stable nitrogen balance state, as evidenced by urea concentration, δ 15N values, and 3-MH. Preliminary analyses suggest that the link between immune function, as quantified by cytokine concentration, and caloric intake is complex and requires further examination.

N2  - OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to assess health-related quality of life and hearing-related disability in subjects with otosclerosis 30 years after surgery.
DESIGN: An observational study was performed. Medical records were reviewed, a clinical examination as well as audiometric assessments were performed. Generic health-related quality of life was assessed by the SF-36v2 and hearing disability by a shortened version of SSQ (speech spatial and qualities of hearing scale).
STUDY SAMPLE: Sixty-five individuals, who had undergone stapedectomy in 1977-79 at a tertiary referral center.
RESULTS: Generic health-related quality of life according to SF-36 subscale scores was comparable to that of an age- and sex-matched reference population. The SF-36 mental component summary score (MCS) was, however, significantly better than that of the reference population. The mental and physical summary component scores correlated significantly to hearing disability measured by the SSQ but not to hearing impairment. Hearing disability was displayed in all SSQ sub-scores, especially in more complex listening situations and in the localization of sounds.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that individuals with otosclerosis, 30 years after surgery, have a good generic health-related quality of life, despite moderate to severe hearing loss and significant hearing disabilities.

N2  - Objectives Middle ear surgery increasingly employs endoscopes as an adjunct to or replacement for the operative microscope. We provide a systematic review of endoscope applications in middle ear surgery with an emphasis on outcomes, including the need for conversion to microscope, audiometric findings, length of follow-up, as well as disease-specific outcomes. Data Sources PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL database. Methods A literature review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis recommendations. Articles were categorized based on study design, indication, and use of an endoscope either as an adjunct to or as a replacement for a microscope. Qualitative and descriptive analyses of studies and outcomes data were performed. Results One-hundred three articles met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Of the identified articles, 38 provided outcomes data. The majority of these studies were moderate quality, retrospective, case-series reports. The indications for use of the endoscope were broad, with the most common being resection of cholesteatoma. In cholesteatoma surgery, endoscope approaches routinely identified residual cholesteatoma in primary and second-look cases. Other outcomes, including robust audiometric data, operating room times, wound healing, and quality of life surveys were not well described. Conclusions Endoscopes have consistently been used as an adjunct to the microscope to improve visualization of the tympanic cavity. Recent reports utilize the endoscope exclusively during surgical dissection; however, data comparing patient outcomes following the use of an endoscope to a microscope are lacking. Areas in need of additional research are highlighted.

N2  - OBJECTIVE: Otologic trauma was the most common physical injury sustained after the April 15, 2013, Boston Marathon bombings. The goal of this study is to describe the resultant otologic morbidity and to report on early outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Multi-institutional prospective cohort study.
METHODS: Children and adults seen for otologic complaints related to the Boston Marathon bombings comprised the study population. Participants completed symptom assessments, quality-of-life questionnaires, and audiograms at initial and 6-month visits. Otologic evaluation and treatment, including tympanoplasty results, were reviewed.
RESULTS: More than 100 patients from eight medical campuses have been evaluated for blast-related otologic injuries; 94 have enrolled. Only 7% had any otologic symptoms before the blasts. Ninety percent of hospitalized patients sustained tympanic membrane perforation. Proximity to blast (RR = 2.7, p < 0.01) and significant nonotologic injury (RR = 2.7, p < 0.01) were positive predictors of perforation. Spontaneous healing occurred in 38% of patients, and tympanoplasty success was 86%. After oral steroid therapy in eight patients, improvement in hearing at 2 and 4 kHz was seen, although changes did not reach statistical significance. Hearing loss, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and difficulty hearing in noise remain persistent and, in some cases, progressive complaints for patients. Otologic-specific quality of life was impaired in this population.
CONCLUSION: Blast-related otologic injuries constitute a major source of ongoing morbidity after the Boston Marathon bombings. Continued follow-up and care of this patient population are warranted.

N2  - STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case review.
OBJECTIVE: Patulous eustachian tube (PET) can have a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life. Previous work has demonstrated that temporarily mass loading and stiffening the tympanic membrane significantly reduces these symptoms. This study examined KTP laser myringoplasty (LM) and cartilage tympanoplasty (CT) as a means to manipulate the tympanic membrane to alleviate PET symptoms.
SETTING: Academic tertiary care referral hospital.
PATIENTS: Patients (n = 20) were identified from the senior authors' (M.B.) specialty eustachian tube disorders clinic. Patients met previously established diagnostic criteria for PET. All patients had a clinically apparent flaccid segment of the eardrum and had symptom improvement after simple mass loading of their eardrum in the clinic.
INTERVENTIONS: Patients in this study received either KTP LM (10 patients, 15 ears) or CT (10 patients, 11 ears) to treat their flaccid eardrum segment in an attempt to alleviate PET symptoms.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preoperative and postoperative questionnaire scores and tympanometry measurements were compared.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing CT for PET had a significant reduction in their symptoms of autophony (p ≤ 0.001), conducted breath sounds (p = 0.001), and aural fullness (p = 0.009). KTP LM did not significantly reduce symptoms.
CONCLUSION: Cartilage tympanoplasty provides a safe and accessible surgical option for the treatment of PET and significantly reduces the symptoms of autophony, conducted breath sounds, and aural fullness. Further studies are needed to investigate whether addressing PET symptoms simultaneously from both the tympanic membrane and the eustachian tube orifice can improve patient symptoms even further.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenesis of recurrent cholesteatoma can be roughly divided into residual lesions and re-retraction of the epithelium. To prevent both residual and re-retraction cholesteatoma, we performed canal wall down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration using the bone pate plate for canal wall reconstruction as a fundamental surgical treatment for patients with acquired cholesteatoma. We attempted to achieve the complete extirpation of cholesteatoma in the wide surgical field made by the canal wall down procedure and simultaneously prevent recurrent retraction cholesteatoma and regain the physiologic canal wall, in which patients can have a "maintenance-free ear."
OBJECTIVE: The surgical method used in the present study was described, and the long-term postoperative results of this method were evaluated.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study.
PATIENTS: Participants were 118 patients with acquired cholesteatoma who underwent canal wall down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration and could be followed-up for more than 5 years.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Postoperative changes in the reconstructed canal wall, the rate of otorrhea, and exposure of the material were examined using endoscopic images, medical charts, and CT scans.
RESULTS: A total of 113 ears (95.8 %) achieved the nearly physiologic appearance of the external auditory canal, and these conditions were maintained throughout the follow-up periods. However, recurrent cholesteatoma was not observed during the follow-up periods. Postoperative otorrhea was observed in 2.5% of ears. Exposure of the bone pate was only noted in 1 patient (0.8 %). Postoperative CT scans confirmed that ossification developed in the bone pate used in the reconstructed canal wall and mastoid surface.
CONCLUSION: Canal wall down tympanoplasty with mastoid obliteration using the bone pate plate for canal wall reconstruction prevents both recurrent and residual cholesteatoma and contributes to a good quality of life for the patient.

N2  - Introduction Aspirin desensitisation therapy is an under-utilised treatment modality for patients with Samter's triad. The recalcitrant nature of the disease limits the benefit of traditional treatments (which often fail to resolve symptoms), leads to early recurrence and multiple operations, and has a significant impact on quality of life. This study aimed to establish the change in health status (as measured by Glasgow Benefit Inventory) in patients with Samter's triad who have undergone aspirin desensitisation therapy for refractory nasal polyposis. Materials and methods All the Samter's triad patients who had undergone aspirin desensitisation therapy in our department were identified and contacted via telephone. These patients were asked if they would mind completing the Glasgow Benefit Inventory, either via a telephone interview or using a written format. Results Nine patients were identified, of which four were male and five were female. Mean patient age was 42 years. The mean follow-up interval was 16 months ± 6 months. An average of 3.5 ± 1.5 surgical procedures had been undertaken. Sustained symptom relief was achieved in five patients. Two patients completed the treatment but gained no perceived benefit, and the remaining two patients were unable to tolerate the treatment. The average Glasgow Benefit Inventory scores for those who achieved sustained benefit were: 36.5 ± 21.5 for general benefits, 0 for social benefits and 25 ± 8 for physical health benefits. Three patients achieved resolution of previously persistent anosmia. None of the patients required revision surgery. For those patients who did not improve, the score was 0 for all categories. No negative outcomes were recorded. No adverse events occurred and no long-term side effects have been reported so far. Conclusion The Glasgow Benefit Inventory outcomes for aspirin desensitisation therapy in Samter's triad patients are favourable and comparable to scores following middle-ear surgery for hearing. We therefore feel that aspirin desensitisation therapy should be offered to all suitable patients with refractory symptoms. Although some patients gained no benefit, no patients reported any negative outcomes. The cost saving benefit of aspirin versus surgery to both the patient and the health system should also be considered.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a direct acoustic cochlear implant (DACI) for speech understanding in noise in patients suffering from severe to profound mixed hearing loss (MHL) due to various etiologies compared to the preoperative best-aided condition. The study was performed at five tertiary referral centers in Europe (Belgium, Germany, Poland and Spain). Nineteen adult subjects with severe to profound MHL due to (advanced) otosclerosis, ear canal fibrosis, chronic otitis media, tympanosclerosis or previous cholesteatoma were implanted with a DACI (Codacs™ Investigational Device) combined with a conventional stapes prosthesis. Unaided and aided speech reception scores in quiet and in noise, preoperative and postoperative air and bone conduction thresholds and aided and unaided sound field thresholds were measured prospectively during the study. Subjective benefit analysis was determined through the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit questionnaire. Quality of life was measured by the Health Utilities Index. All subjects were fitted preoperatively with hearing aids and/or a bone conduction implant on a headband before DACI implantation. This allows direct comparison between different hearing rehabilitation solutions. The mean speech reception threshold in noise improved significantly by 7.9 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after activation of the DACI compared to the preoperative best-aided condition. For all 19 subjects, a mean postoperative aided speech reception threshold of 2.6 dB SNR (standard deviation: 8.3 dB) was measured. On average, no significant shift in the bone conduction thresholds was noted 4-5 months after implantation. A mean sound field threshold improvement of 46 and 16 dB was measured compared to the preoperative unaided and best-aided condition, respectively. Speech perception tests in quiet showed a mean improvement of the word recognition scores by 65 and 48% at 65 dB SPL compared to the preoperative unaided and best-aided condition, respectively. In summary, DACI provides an effective improvement of the speech perception in noise compared to the best-aided condition in subjects suffering from severe to profound MHL. © 2014 S.

N2  - Background: Myasthenia gravis (MG) patients may have autoantibodies to the acetylcholine receptor (AchR), muscle specific kinase (MuSK), striated muscle, or to the muscle proteins titin/ ryanodine receptor/Kv1.4. About half of the patients with MG who do not have AchR antibodies have anti-MuSK antibodies (MuSK Abs). They tend to predominantly female, have more severe or refractory clinical symptoms, marked oculobulbar weakness with facial and tongue atrophy, normal thymus gland, poor response to anticholinesterase and IVIG treatment but favorable response to immunosuppressive therapy and plasma exchange (TPE). MG patients typically receive five to seven TPE regardless of type when symptoms worsen, but we here report maintenance TPE treatment on three MuSK Ab positive MG (MuSK MG) patients. Materials: Total 148 MG patients who received TPE between January 2008 and September 2013 are identified in apheresis service records at the University of Michigan Health System. Among them, 12 patients (8.1%) had MuSK Abs, 11 patients are female, and one patient is male. One patient is deceased due to sepsis in 2009. Currently, three patients have been receiving maintenance TPE. Findings: Case 1: 62-year-old female with dyspnea and dysphonia was diagnosed with MuSK MG in 2009. After two courses of five TPE for exacerbation of symptoms, she started to receive maintenance TPE. The interval between each TPE was 8 weeks at first, but shortened to 6 weeks and eventually to 4 weeks with occasional 3 weeks interval due to mild fatigue, which is unchanged for the last 2 years. She is not on other medications for MG. Case 2: 47-year-old female with progressive ptosis, diplopia, dysarthria, upper extremity weakness and mild dysphagia was diagnosed with MuSK MG in 2009. After two courses of five and four TPE treatments, she started maintenance TPE every other week. The frequency was decreased to every 3 weeks for 2.5 years, but returned to every 2 weeks because of shortened symptom free days between each TPE treatment most likely due to decreased Prednisone dose of 7.5 mg from 10 mg per day. She was also on azathioprine, and pyridostigmine as needed. However, after she had a right tympanoplasty for a chelesteatoma, she had bacteremia and viremia in August 2013. She started antibiotics and azathioprine dose was increased since she could not receive TPE. She developed acute respiratory distress syndrome and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis with multiorgan failure. She was successfully treated with medications and returned to maintenance TPE. Case 3: 40-year-old female who was admitted to the hospital with acute respiratory failure and dysphonia was diagnosed with MuSK MG in 2011. After five courses of 10, 8, 3, 7, 6 TPE treatments and 2 months of weekly TPE treatment, she started maintenance TPE every other week in July 2013, however, the interval shortened to 10 days in October 2013 for her residual symptoms. She is on 10 mg Prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil, and pyridostigmine as needed. All three patients have been in relatively stable condition on maintenance TPE and are either symptom free or mildly symptomatic. The frequency of TPE was adjusted to achieve the best functional status, balanced against the risks of frequent TPE. Fistula or port placement may be required when peripheral access is poor. Conclusion: Maintenance TPE may be an effective option for MuSK MG patients. The key of successful maintenance treatment is to find an appropriate TPE frequency for each individual, and to modify the treatment interval in conjunction with medical management.

N2  - The aim of this retrospective study is to review long term results of full-thickness cartilage palisade tympanoplasty (FTCPT) with malleus head interposition performed on 51 patients (56 ears); 36 women and 15 men (7-73 years, 44 years average). The pathology of ears which encourages this technique of tympanoplasty is presented. On average 12 years after surgery we have elaborated anatomic and functional results. Anatomic results were categorized based on empiric evaluation of the new tympanic membrane status: 40 (71%) tympanic membranes without anatomic irregularities, 14(25%) with irregularities and 2(4%) with secondary perforation. Functional results (tonal audiogram) are based on pure tone average air-bone gap (PTA-ABG) at 4 frequencies. Main functional results of 51 ears (51 audiograms performed): Pre- and post-operative average PTA-ABGs were 27.07±9.98 and 10.77±7.85 dB (t=10.36; p<0.001). In the group of ears with a tympanic membrane with no anatomic irregularities, pre- and post-operative average PTA-ABGs were 27.30±10.56 and 10.82±8.33 dB (t=8.09; p<0.001). In the group of ears with cartilage resorption, pre- and post- -operative PTA-ABGs were 24.92±8.19 and 9.33±6.58 dB (t=6.21; p<0.001). The differences between the two groups are irrelevant. Postoperative PTA-ABG values of ears after first surgery (N=34) and revision surgery (N=17) was significantly different (8.75±5.75 and 15.16±9.62 dB) (t=2.60; p=0.016). In spite of the thickness of the new tympanal membrane, FTCPT is a successful technique for solving advanced ear pathology.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate, by means of the Chronic Ear Survey (CES), the quality of life of patients who had undergone either intact-canal wall tympanoplasty (ICWT) or canal wall-down tympanoplasty (CWDT) with mastoid obliteration. Methods: This was a retrospective case review study performed at a tertiary referral center. Among 379 patients affected by middle ear and mastoid cholesteatoma operated on between November 2000 and December 2009, 50 patients who underwent ICWT and 50 who underwent CWDT with mastoid obliteration were randomly selected. The CES scores were analyzed for both groups. Results: The mean scores on the CES were 6.5 ± 2.1 in patients who underwent CWDT and 6.9 ± 2.2 in patients treated with ICWT (t = -0.93; p > 0.05). No significant differences between the two groups were found on the activity restriction, symptom, or medical resource subscales (p > 0.05). Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate that CWDT with mastoid obliteration resulted in a quality of life comparable with that after ICWT. Postoperative hearing loss is the most frequently reported problem for both techniques. © The Author(s) 2014.

N2  - Direct ear trauma through external auditory canal causing an avulsion injury of malleoincudal complex is a grievous injury that can happen during ear cleaning with indigenous ear hook. One such case of avulsion injury is presented here with its symptomatology, investigation, and management with the review of available literature because of its rarity. Various locally designed indigenous ear hooks are available in street side markets and even online for purchase and used by many without knowing its ill effects on health. Injury caused by these types of hooks may lead to a severe hearing disability, if not properly treated. This presentation is to highlight the fact that indigenous ear hooks; rampantly available online for purchase can cause a potentially major injury leading to hearing disability and thereafter poor quality of life. Reporting and highlighting of such incidents among the ENT community can help increase the public awareness; thereby, eliminating such disastrous consequences. Wikipedia, PubMed, and Google search engine has been used for our data collection and analysis.

N2  - Objective: To compare and evaluate the hearing outcome and complications of otosclerosis treated with the laser or non-laser stapedotomy using meta-analysis. Methods: A thorough search for publications and "in-process" articles with English abstract dating from January 1978 to July 2013 was conducted using Pubmed, EBSCO and Web of Science databases, as well as all related papers. The included criteria were otosclerosis as diagnosis, clear description of surgical methods, calibrated stapedotomy and regular collection of functional results. Hearing results and other comparable data (age, preoperative hearing status, and mean length of follow-up) were collected from the articles. Results: Eleven studies with a total of 1614 subjects were identified to meet our criteria. There was a significant difference in the efficacy of stapedotomy with the laser or non-laser technique; current data showed a combined RR of 1.07 (95% CI: 1.02-1.13, p= 0.005). But, the postoperative complication showed no advantage for the laser group, with a combined RR of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.30-1.34, p= 0.23). Although there was publication bias in this study (p= 0.005), the funnel plot would turn out to be symmetrical after six more studies were added by the trim and fill method. Conclusion: Our overall results suggest that the laser stapedotomy had significantly better hearing results than non-laser stapedotomy. However, current papers on laser and non-laser stapedotomy did not provide enough subjects to make a subgroup analysis of the hearing outcome between different laser groups. More studies reporting different laser techniques are required to provide us with a better understanding of laser stapedotomy. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective To compare anatomic and functional outcomes of the different graft materials used in pediatric tympanoplasty. Materials and methods The patients younger than 18 years of age and who had tympanoplasty between 2010 and 2012 were included in the study. Temporal muscle fascia or cartilage was used as the graft material. The age, gender, the side of the operated ear, the operation technique, pre- and postoperative audiological results, and the status of the graft were noted. An intact graft and an air-bone gap (ABG) ≤ 20 were regarded as surgical success in the postoperative period. Audiograms obtained before surgery and 1 year after surgery were used for the comparison. Results Sixty pediatric cases were included in the study. Fascia graft was used as the graft material in 35 of them, and cartilage was used in 25 patients. The graft success rate was 82.9% in the fascia group while it was 92% in the cartilage group. In the fascia group preoperative ABG was 28.2 ± 10.1 dB, postoperative ABG was 15.1 ± 10.2 dB, and postoperative gain was 13.1 ± 9.6 dB. In the cartilage group, preoperative ABG was 28.9 ± 10.2 dB, and postoperative ABG was 16.8 ± 10.3 dB with a postoperative gain of 12.1 ± 6.8 dB. The differences between the fascia and the cartilage groups were not statistically significant either for hearing gain or graft success rate. Conclusion Cartilage and fascia grafts yield similar results for hearing gain and graft success rate in pediatric tympanoplasty.

N2  - The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of a direct acoustic cochlear implant (DACI) for speech understanding in noise in patients suffering from severe to profound mixed hearing loss (MHL) due to various etiologies compared to the preoperative best-aided condition. The study was performed at five tertiary referral centers in Europe (Belgium, Germany, Poland and Spain). Nineteen adult subjects with severe to profound MHL due to (advanced) otosclerosis, ear canal fibrosis, chronic otitis media, tympanosclerosis or previous cholesteatoma were implanted with a DACI (Codacs™ Investigational Device) combined with a conventional stapes prosthesis. Unaided and aided speech reception scores in quiet and in noise, preoperative and postoperative air and bone conduction thresholds and aided and unaided sound field thresholds were measured prospectively during the study. Subjective benefit analysis was determined through the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit questionnaire. Quality of life was measured by the Health Utilities Index. All subjects were fitted preoperatively with hearing aids and/or a bone conduction implant on a headband before DACI implantation. This allows direct comparison between different hearing rehabilitation solutions. The mean speech reception threshold in noise improved significantly by 7.9 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) after activation of the DACI compared to the preoperative best-aided condition. For all 19 subjects, a mean postoperative aided speech reception threshold of 2.6 dB SNR (standard deviation: 8.3 dB) was measured. On average, no significant shift in the bone conduction thresholds was noted 4-5 months after implantation. A mean sound field threshold improvement of 46 and 16 dB was measured compared to the preoperative unaided and best-aided condition, respectively. Speech perception tests in quiet showed a mean improvement of the word recognition scores by 65 and 48% at 65 dB SPL compared to the preoperative unaided and best-aided condition, respectively. In summary, DACI provides an effective improvement of the speech perception in noise compared to the best-aided condition in subjects suffering from severe to profound MHL.

N2  - RESULTS: All patients (n = 15) achieved disease-free survival without significant morbidity or mortality. When we compared the mean air-bone gaps after surgery, those in the STSG group (n = 8) were found to be significantly lower than those in the w/o STSG group (n = 7; p < 0.001). The success rate for postoperative hearing was 75.0% in the STSG group, which was significantly higher than that in the w/o STSG group (p = 0.014). All patients in the w/o STSG group showed stenosis and closure of the EAC at fewer than 10 months after surgery. In contrast, all patients in the STSG group showed preserved conformation of the new EAC for more than 12 months after surgery. When we compared the mean GBI score between the two groups of patients, the overall and general health scores in the STSG group were found to be significantly higher than those in the w/o STSG group (p = 0.021, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Reconstruction of the EAC using a rolled-up STSG technique in combination with tympanoplasty after LTBR is useful for hearing preservation and the observation of locoregional lesions after surgery, resulting in improved QOL for patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate postoperative hearing outcomes after lateral temporal bone resection (LTBR) with reconstruction of the external auditory canal (EAC) and conductive function for early-stage EAC carcinoma.
METHODS: We retrospectively examined patients diagnosed with early-stage EAC carcinoma treated with surgery alone between January 2006 and December 2012. Patients who had postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy were excluded. Patients receiving LTBR in combination with tympanoplasty were divided into two groups based on the reconstruction of the EAC with and without (w/o) split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs). Audiological data included the preoperative hearing thresholds and the most recent postoperative hearing thresholds obtained at least 12 months after surgery. The hearing outcome was evaluated based on pure-tone audiograms using the Committee on Hearing and Equilibrium guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery for the evaluation of the results of treatment of conductive hearing loss. The postoperative quality of life (QOL) for patients was evaluated using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI).

N2  - Aim: To provide an easy-to-follow evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm for the management of chronic otitis media (COM) in children. Materials/Methods: Literature review and critical analysis of the available evidence in Medline and other scientific database sources. Data synthesis: Otorrhea and hearing loss are the cardinal symptoms of COM, while oto-microscopy and imaging techniques can confirm the diagnosis. Conservative treatment is acceptable to some extent (i.e. mild cases of COM without cholesteatoma). It involves topical drops (quinolones as first choice drugs- strength of recommendation B), as well as performing aural toilet (strength of recommendation B), and avoiding water ingress. Tympanoplasty without mastoidectomy is expected to improve hearing in cases of non-cholesteatomatous COM (strength of recommendation C), and positively affect the children's quality of life (strength of recommendation B). Less experienced surgeons and inflamed, wet middle ear mucosa represent the two most important factors, which could lead to reperforations (strength of recommendation C). The surgical management of COM with cholesteatoma tends to employ the least invasive surgical technique, in order to obtain a small self-cleaning mastoid cavity, as well as good hearing results (strength of recommendation C). Conclusion: The treatment of choice in most cases of pediatric COM is surgery. Figure 1 proposes a detailed and easy-to-follow evidence-based algorithm with regard to the diagnosis and management of COM in children. © The Author(s) 2013.

N2  - Background. The effects of anesthetics on inflammation and oxidative parameters, evaluated in patients without comorbidities undergoing minor surgery, remain unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the inflammatory and oxidative stress status in adult patients undergoing elective minimally invasive surgery, using different anesthetic techniques. Methods. Thirty patients classified as ASA physical status I, who were scheduled for minor surgeries (tympanoplasty or septoplasty), were randomly allocated into two groups: balanced (BAL) anesthesia maintained with isoflurane or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) with propofol. Blood samples were drawn prior to the induction of anesthesia (baseline), 120 min after the beginning of anesthesia and one day after surgery. The proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 was determined by flow cytometry; DNA oxidation was evaluated by the single cell gel electrophoresis assay, and plasma malondialdehyde (lipid peroxidation biomarker) and antioxidant status were determined through fluorometry. Results. Increased IL-6 was observed one day after surgery in both groups (P=0.0001). Malondialdehyde levels did not change among the time points assessed or between the groups (P>0.05). Whereas BAL anesthesia had no effect on acid nucleic and antioxidant status, TIVA decreased oxidized/alkylated purines (P=0.03) and increased antioxidant status (P=0.002) during anesthesia. The two groups did not differ significantly in DNA oxidation or antioxidant status (P>0.05). Conclusion. BAL anesthesia maintained with isoflurane and TIVA maintained with propofol are safe by virtue of not causing oxidative stress status in ASA physical status I patients undergoing minimally invasive surgeries. Moreover, even in minor surgeries, TIVA with propofol produces an antioxidant effect in patients.

N2  - Objectives: Assess the impact of aspirin desensitization therapy on the quality of life in patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. Methods: We used the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) to establish the change in health status in all patients who underwent aspirin desensitization therapy in our unit between January 2009 and December 2012. The GBI was chosen because it is a well-validated post-intervention questionnaire that allows a direct comparison between other otorhinolaryngology interventions. Results: Twenty-one patients were referred for ADT, from which 10 patients were suitable, of which 5 were male and 5 were female. The mean age was 44 years old, and the median follow-up interval was 16 months. An average of 3.6 +/-1.4 surgical procedures had been undertaken. Sustained symptom relief was achieved in 6 patients. 2 patients completed the treatment but gained no perceived benefit, and 2 were unable to tolerate the treatment. Average GBI scores for those who benefitted were 38.2 +/- 13.9 (general), 0 (social), and 30.5 +/- 9.9 (physical health). For those who failed to improve, the score was 0 for all categories. Conclusions: GBI outcomes for aspirin desensitization therapy are comparable to middle ear surgery for hearing and BAHAs, which show a significant improvement in quality of life. Although some patients gained no benefit, no patients reported any negative outcomes.

N2  - Background: Microtia leads to a severe functional and aesthetic handicap. Traditionally, the auricle is often reconstructed with cartilage transplants, which is, however, associated with some partially substantial disadvantages. The authors have instead used implants of porous polyethylene for successful ear reconstruction for years, thus, avoiding some of these disadvantages. A significant benefit for the patient is achieved by simultaneous hearing rehabilitation by the implantation of active middle ear prostheses. Methods: The authors present their surgical concept which allows functional and aesthetic rehabilitation of microtia in children and adolescents in a single operation. In the respective patient collective, audiometric measurements in quiet and noisy environments were conducted pre- and postoperatively, and health-related quality of life was determined using a validated questionnaire. Results: All patients experienced a substantial hearing gain both in quiet and noisy environments. The evaluation of health-related quality of life showed a significant benefit from the intervention. Conclusion: Functional and aesthetic rehabilitation of microtia with active middle ear implants and ear reconstruction using porous polyethylene leads to good and reliable long-term results and can increase the health-related quality of life of affected children and adolescents. The main advantage of this concept is the possibility of a single procedure. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

N2  - Objective of this study is to compare glass ionomer cement application and incus interpositioning techniques in patients who have chronic otitis media, conductive hearing loss with intact tympanic membrane and who undergo hearing reconstruction of staged surgery using a retrospective chart review in the setting of Ministry of Health Ankara Training and Research Hospital ENT Clinic, Turkey. We retrospectively evaluated patients who underwent otological surgery and hearing reconstruction with auto graft incus during 2005-2008 or glass ionomer cement during 2008-2010. Patients who had cholesteatoma, stapes fixation and tympanosclerosis were excluded. Postoperative mean follow-up time of 107 patients was 9.8 months (6-38 months, 83.2 % of them was ≤9 months). Postoperative pure tone hearing thresholds, graft status, gain scores and air bone gaps were recorded. Intact graft, dry ear on the operated side and ABG scores less than 20 dB were accepted as surgical success. Preoperative ABG score was 30.6 ± 7.93 dB in glass ionomer (group I) and 33.6 ± 11.99 dB in incus interpositioning (group II). Postoperative ABG scores were 13.6 ± 10.40 and 22.6 ± 12.39 dB, respectively, in group I and II. Success of closure in ABG scores was obtained in both groups (p < 0.001). Gain scores in group I were better (p = 0.035). Graft success (p = 0.020) correlated with gain score. Results showed that the glass ionomer cement application is a good, cost-effective technique, easy to perform and yields better hearing scores and lower complication rates compared to incus interpositioning technique. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Reconstruction of the external auditory canal (EAC) after resection of carcinoma has become widely performed in combination with tympanoplasty to retain hearing ability, thus improving quality of life. Although skin grafting has been commonly performed, stenosis, infection and delayed wound healing often occur postoperatively. Local flaps can cause less stenosis, but the size and mobility are limited. For preventing stenosis and osteoradionecrosis after postoperative radiation, super-thin as well as durable resurfacing is required. We present two cases of reconstruction of the EAC using a super-thin free superficial circumflex iliac perforator (SCIP) flap. The flap was elevated as a super-thin flap primarily and inset into the defect as a tube. The flap survived completely without stenosis, infection or osteoradionecrosis even after postoperative radiation therapy. As this flap can securely cover the important structures, causes less stenosis and can endure postoperative radiation therapy, we believe that this method could be an option for reconstruction after resection of EAC cancers. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of British Association of Plastic, Reconstructive and Aesthetic Surgeons.

N2  - To study objective or subjective preoperative factors predicting improvement in listening capabilities and patient satisfaction after stapes surgery in otosclerosis. Prospective, multicenter study. Two tertiary referral centers. Fifty-four consecutive adult patients with otosclerosis. Stapedotomy, stapedectomy. Pure tone and speech audiometry and questionnaires were assessed preoperatively and repeated 6 months postoperatively. The questionnaires consisted of a visual analogue scale (VAS, 0-10) to score the overall quality of life, and the Operation Benefit Profile to assess the listening capability in various circumstances. Stereophony, defined by the Belfast rule of thumb, was used to divide the patients in 3 categories having unilateral, symmetric bilateral, or asymmetric bilateral hearing loss. Six patients were considered early failures of surgery, and 8 patients were lost to follow-up. In the remaining 40 patients (43 ears), all audiometric parameters improved significantly. The postoperative air-bone gap was less than 10 dB in 70%. The postoperative average air conduction threshold was less than 30 dB in 49%. The postoperative quality of life was excellent (VAS, ≥9) in 45% and did not correlate with any preoperative parameter. Preoperative and postoperative overall listening capabilities correlated slightly (Spearman r, 0.47). The postoperative VAS correlated with all postoperative audiometric parameters and the Operation Benefit Profile. Uncomplicated stapes surgery itself is the only predictor of improvement in listening capabilities and patient satisfaction 6 months after stapes surgery in otosclerosis.

N2  - To study the effectiveness of tympanoplasty for treatment of chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma in children. Twenty-three cases with chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma treated by tympanoplasty were retrospectively studied, among which 15 cases had complete clinical data. The condition of surgical cavities, the duration of getting dry ears, the hearing improvements, the growth of new ear drums and whether the recurrence of cholesteatomas occurred or not were observed. In all patients, the chief complains were ear discharging and hearing loss. The tympanum membranes(pars flaccid or pars tensa) became retracted or perforated and CT scan showed mastoid processes were poor developed in some cases with lesions mainly located at attic, middle tympanum cavity and/or petrous parts. The duration of getting dry ear was (6.0 +/- 1.5) weeks after surgery. The effective rate was 80%. The hearing of 12 cases has been improved, that of 2 cases has no changed, that of 1 case has been descended, and 1 case exhibited recurrent cholesteatoma after surgery. This study demonstrated that children's chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma have their own clinic features of wide erosiveness and strong aggressiveness, and tympanoplasty has been proved to treat this disease effectively, also been proved to improve these patients' hearing cognitions and eventually improve their life qualities.

N2  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to measure the effect of endoscopic stapling of Zenker's diverticulum on the health status of patients. Methods: We used the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) tool to ascertain patients' perceived experience. Results: The study demonstrated a positive health impact following endoscopic stapling of the Zenker's diverticulum. The mean total GBI score was +18.9 (95% confidence interval, ±11.2). The impact of endoscopic stapling was positive for all three subsets of the GBI. The GBI scores were comparable to those obtained after other common otorhinolaryngological procedures such as tonsillectomy, rhinoplasty, and middle ear surgery. Conclusions: These data should improve our ability to counsel patients regarding important therapeutic decisions and expectations of surgical outcome. © 2012 Annals Publishing Company.

N2  - Objective: To assess the factors affecting health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after ear surgery in patients with chronic otitis media (COM). Design: Prospective questionnaire-based outcome study. Setting: Tertiary care institution. Patients: The study population comprised 205 patients aged 21 to 67 years referred for ear surgery owing to COM with or without cholesteatoma between November 2009 and March 2011. Interventions: The ear surgery for COM included tympanoplasty, with or without mastoidectomy. The Korean version of the Chronic Ear Survey (K-CES), a disease-specific outcome survey, was administered before and 12 months after surgery. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures were the total score and subscale score, including an activity restriction-based subscale, symptom subscale, and medical resource utilization subscale. The scores were analyzed with disease- and patient-related factors affecting health-related quality of life. Results: Of the 205 patients enrolled, complete data from 156 patients were available for this study. The K-CES score in patients with COM improved after ear surgery in total and in all subscales of the K-CES (P < .001). In univariable analysis, poor improvement in total K-CES score was more likely to occur after ear surgery in patients with postoperative complications, diabetes mellitus, hearing loss as a chief complaint, lower air conduction threshold in postoperative audiometry, and a high level of education and in those who underwent canal wall down mastoidectomy (P < .05). Multivariable analysis using multiple linear regression revealed that the occurrence of complications, presence of diabetes mellitus, level of education, and postoperative air conduction thresholds were independent factors for poor improvement in total K-CES score (P < .05). Conclusion: Recognition of factors that have significant relation with subjective outcomes may help surgeons to identify patients who are prone to have a lower satisfaction and provide useful information in preoperative counseling. ©2012 American Medical Association.

N2  - Objective: Cholesteatoma is an abnormal destructive growth of squamous epithelium in middle ear and mastoid. The presence of cholesteatoma requires surgical intervention and the main goal is to achieve a safe, dry ear and to improve hearing. The extension of surgery depends on the size of the cholesteatoma. Method: A total of 875 patients were treated for cholesteatoma in our department between 2001 and 2010, 213 pediatric patients. We performed both open and closed and technique, depending on disease extension, bone erosion, and complications, followed by second-look surgery in most of the closed-technique cases. Results: The closed technique was the treatment of choice in 69.2% cases, most of them uncomplicated cholesteatomas. In 30.6% we performed open technique for different reasons. Second look surgery was done in 57.3% of cases after 1.5 or 2 years. A total of 27.1% of patients were lost to the follow-up program after the first years. Residual cholesteatomas were noticed in 17% of the cases and the recurrent cholesteatomas were operated in 32% of the cases. After surgery the air-bone gape improved in 67.1% of the cases because of tympanoplasty with autologous graft or different types of prosthesis. In some cases we used the BAHA prosthesis. Conclusion: Cholesteatoma is a serious condition which needs surgical treatment. Second-look control in closed technique should be done after one-one and a half year. Closed technique is recommended in order to restore the function of the ear which is very important for a proper development and a good quality of life.

N2  - Conclusion: In patients with progressive conductive hearing loss and a normal tympanic membrane (TM), and with soft tissue density in the middle ear cavity (MEC) on temporal bone computed tomography (TBCT) scan, open-type congenital cholesteatoma (OCC) should be highly suspected and a proper surgical plan that includes mastoid exploration and second-stage operation is required. Objective: The clinical presentation of OCC is very similar to congenital ossicular anomaly (COA) presenting with a conductive hearing loss with intact TM. Therefore, it is challenging to make a correct preoperative diagnosis in patients with OCC. We evaluated the clinical characteristics of OCC compared with those of COA to find diagnostic clues useful in diagnosis of OCC. Methods: The medical records of 12 patients with surgically proven OCC and 14 patients with surgically proven COA were reviewed for demographic data, otologic history, preoperative TBCT findings, intraoperative findings, and pre- and postoperative audiologic data. Results: There was no difference between OCC and COA based on demographic data, preoperative hearing, and ossicular status on TBCT. However, the presence of progressive hearing loss, soft tissue density in the MEC on TBCT scan, and the need for mastoid surgery and second-stage operation were significantly more frequent in OCC patients. © 2012 Informa Healthcare.

N2  - Hearing loss is commonin older adults. Patients, clinicians, and health care staff often do not recognize hearing loss, particularly in its early stages, and it is under treated. Age-related hearing loss or presbycusis, the most common type of hearing loss in older adults, is a multifactorial sensorineural loss that frequently includes a component of impaired speech discrimination. Simple office-based screening and evaluation procedures can identify potential hearing disorders, which should prompt audiologic referral to confirm the diagnosis with audiometric testing.The main stay of treatment is amplification. For many older adults, accepting the need for amplification, selecting and purchasing a hearing aid, and getting accustomed to its use is a daunting and often frustrating process. There are numerous barriers to hearing aid use, the most common of which is dissatisfaction with its performance across a range of sonic environments. Newer digital hearing aids have many features that improve performance, making them potentially more acceptable to users, but they are expensive and are not covered by Medicare. Hearing aids have been demonstrated to improve hearing function and hearing-related quality of life (QOL), but evidence is less robust for improving overall QOL. Depending upon the etiology of the hearing loss, other medical and surgical procedures, including cochlear implantation, may benefit older adults. Older adults with multiple morbidities and who are frail pose specific challenges for the management of hearing loss. These patients may require integration of hearing assessment and treatment as part of functional assessment in an interdisciplinary, team-based approach to care. ©2012 American Medical Association.

N2  - Objectives/Hypothesis: Facial synkinesis and hyperkinesis commonly impair the outcome of facial nerve palsy. Botulinum toxin type A has shown positive results in the treatment of these symptoms. Our experience is reported in this article. Study Design: Prospective study. Methods: Forty-one patients affected by facial synkinesis and hyperkinesis due to facial palsy were treated. The etiology of the facial palsy was: 28 Bell's palsy cases, nine iatrogenic cases (seven acoustic neuroma surgeries, one tympano-jugular glomus tumor removal, and one middle ear surgery), three herpes zoster virus cases, and one case of Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome. Botulinum toxin type A was used in the treatment. Clinical evaluation was obtained through the Sunnybrook Grading Scale and an author's modification of this method purposely designed for evaluation of hyperkinesis. Further evaluation through a self-administered synkinesis questionnaire was also performed. Results: All patients showed some improvement of synkinesis and hyperkinesis after treatment. The mean values of the data obtained, regardless of the method of evaluation, gave statistically significant results. Correlation between objective and subjective evaluation methods was also statistically positive. Conclusions: This work stresses the importance of considering synkinesis and hyperkinesis separately because they are different conditions. These two symptoms showed improvement after botulinum toxin treatment, but only hyperkinesis showed a positive correlation when objective and subjective evaluations were performed. This treatment is effective in the management of facial synkinesis and hyperkinesis due to facial palsy, thus improving quality of life. It is a safe, minimally invasive treatment that can be repeated. © 2011 The American Laryngological.

N2  - Objective: To measure the Quality of Life outcomes and impact on tinnitus perception in a group of patients after Round Window Vibroplasty (RW-VSB) for mixed or conductive hearing loss. Study design: A single-subject, repeated measures design was employed. All VSB fittings were based on hearing thresholds results and were not set to mask tinnitus. Methods: Ten Round Window-Vibroplasty patients were assessed with the Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (APHAB) and the Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire (TRQ). Results: Subjects reported less hearing difficulties in 3 of 4 APHAB subscales. Tinnitus perception was decreased in all subjects with tinnitus pre-operatively. Conclusion: Round window vibroplasty in our cohort of patients with mixed or conductive hearing improved quality of life outcomes. There was significant improvement on APHAB scores and a significant decrease in tinnitus perception in subjects experiencing tinnitus prior to implantation.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate the long-term results and predictive factors of a good outcome with the use of a total ossicular replacement prosthesis in children. Design: Retrospective case review. Setting: Tertiary referral center. Patients: The study included 114 children (116 ears). Interventions: A total of 116 ears underwent total ossicular chain reconstruction with a titanium prosthesis. Cartilage was always used for tympanic membrane reconstruction. Main Outcome Measures: Audiological results were evaluated according to the guidelines of the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery. Predictive factors of audiological results were determined. Logistic regression and χ2 tests were used for statistical analysis. Results: The mean age at surgery was 9.8 years. Ossiculoplasty was performed during second-look surgery in 91 ears (78.4%) and during another stage in 25 ears (21.6%). The first-stage procedure was always performed for cholesteatoma. Audiometric results were available for 116 ears at 1 year, for 89 ears (76.7%) at 2 years, and for 42 ears (36.2%) at 5 years. Closure of the average air-bone gap (ABG) to within 20 dB was achieved in 65 ears (56%) at 1 year. The mean (SD) preoperative and postoperative (at 1 year) ABGs were 41.0 (9.5) dB and 22.4 (12.6) dB, respectively. There were no cases of extrusion, but 17 luxations of the prosthesis were confirmed by computed tomography. Luxation occurred on average at 31.4 months. Only three 4000-Hz degradations of bone conduction were reported, with no dead ears. We examined 3 predictive factors of auditory results: preoperative ABG, footplate status, and postoperative otoscopic findings. Conclusions: Total ossiculoplasty is a reliable technique in children. Long-term hearing outcomes are stable and satisfactory, but luxation can occur at any time. Preoperative ABG and footplate status are negative predictive factors of auditory results. ©2011 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - Study Objective: To determine whether orally administered atenolol provides an optimal surgical field in comparison to intravenous sodium nitroprusside or esmolol during tympanoplasty. Design: Randomized, double-blinded study. Setting: Operating room in a university hospital. Patients: 105 ASA physical status 1 and 2 adult patients undergoing tympanoplasty. Interventions: Patients were randomized to three groups to receive either oral atenolol 50 mg twice daily for one day prior to surgery (Group I), intraoperative nitroprusside infusion (Group II), or intraoperative esmolol infusion (Group III). Measurements: Quality of the operative field, mean arterial pressure, and heart rate were assessed. Blood gases, liver enzymes, cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB release, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine concentrations also were measured. Main Results: Time to achieve target surgical field was significantly reduced in the atenolol group versus the other groups (8.3 ± 3.2, 28.2 ± 6.4, and 17.2 ± 5.3 min, respectively). Heart rate significantly decreased in the atenolol and esmolol groups versus the nitroprusside group (P < 0.0001). Mean arterial pressure after extubation and frequency of rebound hypertension were comparable in the groups. No significant changes in cardiac enzymes, renal and hepatic function, or acid-base status were noted. Conclusions: Although the three drugs are acceptable for obtaining an optimum surgical field, preoperative oral beta blocker appeared to be rapid in onset and was simpler to implement. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background: Informed consent is a phrase often used in the law to indicate that the consent a person gives meets certain minimum standards. It relies on patients' ability to understand risk information. Evidence suggests that people may extract the gist of any risk information to make medical decisions. Existing evidence also suggests that there is an inverse relationship between the perception of risk and the perception of benefit. Informed consent is the method by which fully informed, rational persons may be involved in choices about their health care. Aim: The aims of this study were to study how much patients remember of the risks discussed with them about their otolaryngologic surgery and to evaluate whether a simple intervention, the addition of an information handout, improves their recall. Methods: This was a prospective study carried out between January and December 2009 in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University of Ilorin teaching hospital. Fifty patients undergoing a variety of otorhinolaryngologic procedures, including mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, nasal polypectomy, rhinotomy, maxillectomy, and laryngoscopy, were verbally consented by the operating surgeon with a standard checklist of potential surgical complications and adverse effects. Three surgeons participated in the study. Patients were stratified into 2 groups: a higher education group and a lower education group. Within each group, patients were randomized to either a control group, consisting of a verbal explanation only, or an intervention group, which added a written handout to the verbal explanation. A follow-up telephone interview was conducted at an average of 20.6 days (range, 14-53 days) to survey for recall of the complications discussed. The main outcome measure is risk recall. This was analyzed by education level and written sheet intervention. Other parameters examined were patient demographics and time elapsed from when the consent was obtained. Results: Of the 50 patients involved in the study, 30 were men and 20 were women, with male/female ratio of 1.5:1.0. The average age was 43 years (range, 16-76 years). With respect to educational status, 26 patients had the equivalent of high school or less (group 1), and 24 had some degree of postsecondary training (group 2). Overall recall of potential complications was 56%. Those who received the handout recalled 67% of the complications overall, whereas those who did not receive the handout remembered 51% of the complications. The difference was significant Recall of the specific risks varied considerably. For those with potential risk of facial nerve paralysis, 88% of them recalled, which was the highest in the study. This was followed by hearing loss (85%) and nasal adhesion (23%). The least were anesthetic reactions (4%) and hoarseness (2%). Those who received the handout recalled 62% of the complications overall, whereas those who did not receive the handout remembered 51% the complications. Conclusion: The addition of a handout significantly alters recall of potential complications of otorhinolaryngologic surgery with the recall of specific risk highest for facial nerve paralysis. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

N2  - Background/Aims: To evaluate the surgical outcome of tympanoplasty with mastoidectomy for cholesterol granuloma of the middle ear in post-irradiated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Methods: Nine post-irradiated NPC patients diagnosed with cholesterol granuloma in a single-sided middle ear were included in this study. The time from radiotherapy termination to surgery ranged from 6 to 14 years (median 9 years). All patients underwent radical tympanoplasty with canal wall down or up mastoidectomy. Results: All the patients with NPC received radiotherapy of 68-75 Gy before surgery. Three ears underwent tympanoplasty with canal wall down mastoidectomy, and 6 ears underwent tympanoplasty with canal wall up mastoidectomy. All the patients were followed up for at least 2 years. Seven ears (77.8%) had an intact tympanic membrane and 2 ears developed re-perforation of the eardrum 3 months after surgery, but otorrhea decreased significantly. All these patients reported improved quality of life after surgery. Before the operation, the pure tone averages (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 kHz) were 90.5 dB and the air-bone gaps (0.5, 1, 2 kHz) were 45.8 dB (vs. 62.3 and 25.5 dB, respectively, at 6 months after the operation). Conclusions: Most post-irradiated NPC patients with cholesterol granuloma of the middle ear benefit from this surgery. Chronic otitis media caused by radiotherapy is not a contraindication to tympanoplasty. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

N2  - Objectives: To examine and report results for tympanoplasties performed in a tertiary-care city teaching hospital serving one of the most ethnically diverse neighborhoods in the United States. Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: Adult patients who underwent type I tympanoplasty from January 2009 through July 2010 were eligible. Charts were reviewed for preand postoperative drum status, patient characteristics, temporal bone CT scans and audiologic data. The primary outcome measure was successful repair, defined as an intact drum at last follow-up visit. A secondary outcome measure was postoperative hearing improvement, defined as a difference between airconduction and bone-conduction pure-tone averages of less than 20 dB. Results: 27 patients were included in the study. 15 patients (64%) had perforations greater than 50% of the drum area and 10 (37%) had bilateral perforations. 18 patients (67%) had a successful repair. Success rates were lower in patients with preoperative temporal bone CT scans showing chronic otomastoiditis compared to those with normal CT scans (p< 0.0034); perforation size, patient age, bilateral disease and ethnicity were not predictive factors. 13 patients with successful repairs had postoperative audiograms performed and 11 (85%) showed hearing improvement. Conclusions: Ethnically diverse patient populations found at a city teaching hospital may be more difficult to treat because of a higher incidence of active chronic otitis media with perforations. Meticulous surgical technique with close attending surgeon-resident supervision, review of preoperative CT imaging and evaluation for aerating mastoidectomy may lead to improved success for tympanoplasty in this population.

N2  - Introduction: The goal of cholesteatoma surgery is to achieve a safe ear, a dry ear, and to restore hearing as much as possible, while minimizing the number of surgeries. Aim: To evaluate long-term hearing status of patients undergoing cholesteatoma surgery in a referral otologic center. Design: Prospective data was collected from 43 consecutive pediatric cholesteatoma surgeries, for which complete audiometric follow up data for both ears was available. Results: Canal wall up mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty (CWU) was performed in 16 children, 100% of them achieved a dry ear. Mean post operative hearing thresholds were 34/12.4. Canal wall down mastoidectomy (CWD) was performed in 27 children, 75% of them achieved a dry ear. Mean post operative hearing thresholds were 62.1/22.2 dB. Discussion: Post operative hearing loss should be taken care of as soon as possible, and it should include conventional hearing aids fitting, soft band BAHA or implantable BAHA as the standard of care. When BAHA is not a realistic rehabilitation option (patient or family refusal) a round window vibrant sound bridge (VSB) implantation should be considered.

However, further randomized controlled trials with large sample sizes are needed to improve the estimation. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of sound transmission and stability of the prostheses in the titanium or non-titanium ossiculoplasty groups by meta-analysis for clinical implications and applications. Methods: Previous studies comparing the hearing status of patients with titanium and non-titanium prostheses were reviewed on PubMed, accompanied by a manual search of all the related references. The eligibility of the investigation was independently confirmed by two reviewers, who extracted all the data from the papers included accordingly for the standard meta-analysis. Results: The study included 12 eligible investigations covering 1388 patients, with the pooled risk ratio (RR) estimating the effectiveness of the postoperational prostheses between the titanium and non-titanium group, with a combined RR of 1.12 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98-1.27, p = 0.09), as well as their stability, with a combined RR of 1.47 (95% CI: 0.76-2.84, p = 0.26). © 2011 Informa Healthcare.

N2  - Background: A bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) consists of a permanent titanium fixture, which is surgically implanted into the skull bone behind the ear, and a small detachable sound processor that clips onto the fixture. BAHAs are suitable for people with conductive or mixed hearing loss who cannot benefit fully from conventional hearing aids. Objectives: To assess the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of BAHAs for people who are bilaterally deaf. Data sources: Nineteen electronic resources, including MEDLINE, EMBASE and The Cochrane Library (inception to November 2009). Additional studies were sought from reference lists and clinical experts. Review methods: Inclusion criteria were applied by two reviewers independently. Data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken by one reviewer and checked by a second. Prospective studies of adults or children with bilateral hearing loss were eligible. Comparisons were BAHAs versus conventional hearing aids [air conduction hearing aid (ACHA) or bone conduction hearing aid (BCHA)], unaided hearing and ear surgery; and unilateral versus bilateral BAHAs. Outcomes included hearing measures, validated measures of quality of life (QoL), adverse events and measures of cost-effectiveness. For the review of cost-effectiveness, full economic evaluations were eligible. Results: Twelve studies were included (seven cohort pre-post studies and five crosssectional 'audiological comparison' studies). No prospective studies comparing BAHAs with ear surgery were identified. Overall quality was rated as weak for all included studies and meta-analysis was not possible due to differences in outcome measures and patient populations. There appeared to be some audiological benefits of BAHAs compared with BCHAs and improvements in speech understanding in noise compared with ACHAs; however, ACHAs may produce better audiological results for other outcomes. The limited evidence reduces certainty. Hearing is improved with BAHAs compared with unaided hearing. Improvements in QoL with BAHAs were identified by a hearing-specific instrument but not generic QoL measures. Studies comparing unilateral with bilateral BAHAs suggested benefits of bilateral BAHAs in many, but not all, situations. Prospective case series reported between 6.1% and 19.4% loss of implants. Most participants experienced no or minor skin reactions. A decision analytic model was developed. Costs and benefits of unilateral BAHAs were estimated over a 10-year time horizon, applying discount rates of 3.5%. The incremental cost per user receiving BAHA, compared with BCHA, was £16,409 for children and £13,449 for adults. In an exploratory analysis the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was between £55,642 and £119,367 for children and between £46,628 and £100,029 for adults for BAHAs compared with BCHA, depending on the assumed QoL gain and proportion of each modelled cohort using their hearing aid for ≥ 8 or more hours per day. Deterministic sensitivity analysis suggested that the results were highly sensitive to the assumed proportion of people using BCHA for ≥ 8 hours per day, with very high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio values (£500,000-1,200,000 per QALY gained) associated with a high proportion of people using BCHA. More acceptable values (£15,000-37,000 per QALY gained) were associated with a low proportion of people using BCHA for ≥ 8 hours per day (compared with BAHA). Limitations: The economic evaluation presented in this report is severely limited by a lack of robust evidence on the outcome of hearing aid provision. This has lead to a more restricted analysis than was originally anticipated (limited to a comparison of BAHA and BCHA). In the absence of useable QoL data, the cost-effectiveness analysis is based on potential utility gains from hearing, that been inferred using a QoL instrument rather than measures reported by hearing aid users themselves. As a result the analysis is regarded as exploratory and the reported results should be interpreted with caution. Conclusions: Exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis suggests that BAHAs are unlikely to be a cost-effective option where the benefits (in terms of hearing gain and probability of using of alternative aids) are similar for BAHAs and their comparators. The greater the benefit from aided hearing and the greater the difference in the proportion of people using the hearing aid for ≥ 8 hours per day, the more likely BAHAs are to be a cost-effective option. The inclusion of other dimensions of QoL may also increase the likelihood of BAHAs being a cost-effective option. A national audit of BAHAs is needed to provide clarity on the many areas of uncertainty surrounding BAHAs. Further research into the nonaudiological benefits of BAHAs, including QoL, is required.

N2  - Background: Chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) is frequently associated with symptoms of inflammation like discharge from the ear or pain. In many cases, patients suffer from hearing loss causing communication problems and social withdrawal. The objective of this work was to collect prospective audiological data and data on general and disease-specific quality of life with validated quality of life measurement instruments to assess the impact of the disease on health-related quality of life (HR-QOL).Methods: 121 patients were included in the study. Patients were clinically examined in the hospital before and 6 months after surgery including audiological testing. They filled in the quality of life questionnaires SF-36 and Chronic Otitis Media Outcome Test 15 (COMOT-15) pre-operatively and 6 and 12 months post-operatively, respectively.Results: Complete data records from 90 patients were available for statistical analysis. Disease-specific HR-QOL in patients with CSOM improved after tympanoplasty in all the scales of the COMOT-15. There was no difference in HR-QOL assessment between patients with mesotympanic respectively epitympanic CSOM. However, we did find the outcome to be worse in patients who received revision surgery compared with those receiving primary surgery. Audiometric findings correlated very well with the subscale hearing function from the COMOT-15 questionnaire. General HR-QOL measured with the SF-36 was not significantly changed by tympanoplasty.Conclusions: Tympanoplasty did lead to a significant improvement of disease-specific HR-QOL in patients with CSOM while general HR-QOL did not change. Very well correlations were found between the subscale hearing function from the COMOT-15 questionnaire and audiological findings. Revision surgery seems to be a predictor for a worse outcome. © 2011 Baumann et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

N2  - Objectives: Quality-of-life issues related to chronic otitis media (COM) include physical symptoms, emotional symptoms, hearing loss, speech symptoms, social symptoms, and parents' emotional symptoms. In this study we evaluated the effects of tympanoplasty on the quality of life of pediatric patients. Methods: In a questionnaire-based outcome study, we reviewed 56 of 78 pediatric patients with COM who were treated with type I tympanoplasty at our institution between December 2008 and February 2010. All patients were asked to fill out the COM-5 questionnaire with their parents, before operation and 6 months after operation. Preoperative and postoperative total ear scores, preoperative and postoperative ear scores with an intact tympanic membrane, preoperative and postoperative ear scores with a perforated tympanic membrane, and preoperative and postoperative audiological results were assessed. Results: After type I tympanoplasty, 45 patients (80.3%) had successful closure of the tympanic membrane, but 11 patients (19.7%) had unsuccessful closure of the tympanic membrane. There was a significant decrease in physical suffering, hearing loss, emotional distress, activity limitations, and caregiver's concerns scores in patients with intact tympanic membranes after operation (p < 0.01). Conclusions: Children with COM had a significant increase in their quality of life after successful tympanoplasty. Our results also suggested that tympanoplasty was successful in pediatric patients with COM. © 2011 Annals Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

N2  - The objective of this study is to determine the subjective and objective outcomes of tympanoplasty surgery carried out in patients with otitis media and to identify factors responsible for these outcomes. The study setting is tertiary care urban referral hospital in a developing economy and the study methodology is a prospective analysis of patients with diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media that had tympanoplasty with or without mastoidectomy between May 2005 and September 2009 at National Hospital Abuja. Subjects were evaluated for age, sex, size and site of perforation, status of operated ear(s) (dry/discharging), status of the contralateral ear, surgical technique, subjective and objective pre-operative and post-operative hearing scores, average post-operative follow-up time, and post-operative complications, and results were statistically analyzed. A total of 45 patients (51 ears) were operated. Age distribution was 8-52 years. Type 1 tympanoplasty was done in 41 patients and Type 3 in 4 patients. Seven of the patient had concomitant mastoid surgery (cortical mastoidectomy). 3/51 of the cases had discharging ears at surgery. 16/45 of the patients (19/51 ears) had cartilage graft tympanoplasty, while 29/45 (32 ears) had temporalis fascia tympanoplasty. 15/16 of the cartilage group as well as 26/29 of the fascia group reported subjective hearing improvement, whilst the actual graft take was 12/16 of the cartilage group and 23/29 of the fascia group. Objective hearing improvement was observed in all of the cartilage as well as 26/29 of the fascia group. This study confirms success of tympanoplasty among Nigerians, and recommends that subjective hearing assessment should form part of indicators for success following tympanoplasty. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - Introduction: The aim of this work is to re-examine our experience with the treatment of conductive and mixed hearing loss using the Baha system. Materials and Methods: The system was implanted in 47 patients (16 adults and 31 children under the age of 14), bilaterally in two cases. The causes of hypoacusis were bilateral congenital aural atresia (31 patients), bilateral chronic otitis media or outcomes of middle-ear surgery (9), and otosclerosis (7). The following parameters were assessed: mean preoperative air and bone conduction thresholds for the frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz; mean postoperative threshold with the Baha; hearing improvement calculated by subtracting the postoperative threshold with the Baha from the preoperative threshold for air conduction in the better ear; speech audiometry test; improvement in the quality of life, calculated using the Glasgow Benefit Inventory for the adult patients and the Glasgow Children's Benefit Inventory for paediatric patients; frequency and type of surgical complications. Follow-up ranged from 6 to 38 months. Results: The audiological results were satisfactory, with air-bone gap closure in 85.1% of cases. In terms of quality of life, assessment using the GBI showed a clear-cut improvement in health for all the 45 patients that answered to the questionnaires in our study. Out of the 49 operations that were performed, complications were reported in 3 cases (6.1%): 2 cases of skin regrowth around the titanium screw and one in which the abutment was not osseointegrated. Conclusions: The data from this study show that the Baha system offers a high percentage of success, which can significantly improve the patient's quality of life, and a low rate of complications.

N2  - The loss of taste often does not receive the medical attention it deserves which may have serious implications for patients' quality of life. More than 2 million Americans have some type of chemosensory disorder. We report a case of a patient with a history of allergic rhinitis presenting with loss of taste who was found to have pernicious anemia. A 64-year-old male with a history of allergic rhinosinusitis presented with diminished gustation to sweet flavors for one year. He denied any decreased sense of smell. On prior visits this loss of taste was attributed to his allergic rhinitis. He denied heartburn, head trauma, surgical procedures or radiation treatment. Past medical history was significant for hyperlipidemia and glaucoma. His medications included cetirizine, mometasone nasal spray, simvastatin, and travoprost eye drops. His exam was significant for a beefy tongue. There were no thyromegaly or parotid masses. His neurologic exam was unremarkable. No polyps or nasopharyngeal masses were seen on rhinoscopy. Significant labs included zinc=548 ug/L (normal>600ug/L), vitamin B12=146pg/mL (160-911pg/ml), homocyteine=19.47 umol/L (5-13.9 umol/L), methylmalonic acid=0.78 umol/L (<0.40 umol/L), and intrinsic factor antibody was detected. CBC did not reveal macrocytosis. The diagnosis of pernicious anemia was made. The patient was begun on vitamin B12 replacement therapy with improvement of his taste sensation. With the exclusion of nasal and sinus diseases, the common causes for gustatory dysfunction are viral and oral infection, aging, neoplasia, trauma, and middle ear surgery and disease. In addition, metabolic diseases such as diabetes or hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 or zinc deficiency, medication side effects, or irradiation can be the source of neural injuries. Rarely, central neural factors result in loss of taste. No standardized tests are presently available for workup of taste. Evaluation should include thorough oral pharyngeal and neurologic exam as well as workup for metabolic or endocrine disease. If no abnormality is found, fiberoptic evaluation should be performed. Additional evaluation with CT or MR of the head is further indicated to rule out an intracranial or peripheral nerve abnormality. Loss of taste, to sweets in particular, is often overlooked as a result of loss of smell. Allergists should be aware of the evaluation for loss of taste, keeping in mind a broad differential diagnosis.

N2  - Purpose-Objective: Otospongiosis is a disease affecting the homeostasis of the otic capsule in adults and is among the most common causes of acquired hearing loss. However, there is sparse literature pertaining to this condition in children. OBJECTIVE: To identify cases of otospongiosis in tertiary care pediatric hospital, to provide a review of imaging and clinical characteristics. To review current treatment for otospongiosis. Material and methods: Retrospective search was made of radiology and otolaryngology database to identify cases of otospongiosis at a tertiary care Children's Hospital. Results: 3 cases with conductive hearing loss & imaging findings of fenestral otospongiosis were identified (n=3, all females, ages 1-9; 2 cases were bilateral). One patient died from end stage renal disease without treatment for hearing loss. One was treated with a unilateral hearing aid & 1 was treated with stapedectomy and ossicular prosthesis. Discussion and conclusion: Otospongiosis is a common cause of conductive hearing loss but few cases are reported in children where treatment can have a significant impact in development & quality of life. Since this disease appears to be under recognized and underreported, the course and long-term prognosis are unknown and further research is warranted. Pitfalls including normal variants that can mimic otospongiosis in neonates are discussed. Improved spatial resolution on multislice CT should help diagnosis of otospongiosis in children.

N2  - Background: Clinical experience has shown that chronic otitis media (COM) affects health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) of the patients. Nevertheless, up to now no validated measurement instrument encompassing all the relevant dimensions of HR-QOL is available. Material and methods: In phase 1 the development of the Chonic Otitis Media Outcome Test (COMOT) was conducted. A group of experts identified 31 HR-QOL concepts as being relative for COM which was reduced to 15 items (COMOT-15) by sequential statistical analysis on the basis of data from 50 consecutive COM patients. In addition to the overall score (GS), three sub-scores (ear symptoms, OS; hearing function, HF; and mental being, PB) were introduced. In phase 2 validation was performed by calculating reliability, validity, and responsiveness with the data of 121 prospectively evaluated patients. Results: COMOT-15 showed an excellent reliability with high internal consistency (Cronbach's ά from 0.89 to 0.91) and high retest reliability coefficients (all r>0.8). Content validity was determined by a study of the literature. COMOT-15 can distinguish COM patients from healthy subjects. Global assessment of impairment of HR-QOL by COM correlated very well with the scores of COMOT-15. However, the responsiveness of the COMOT-15 questionnaire was low. Conclusions: COMOT-15 is a reliable, valid and sensitive instrument for measurement of HR-QOL of COM patients. The results obtained with the questionnaire can be interpreted very well by the investigator. COMOT-15 should be used in otological outcomes research. © Springer Medizin Verlag 2009.

N2  - Objective: We evaluated functional results after stapedotomy in terms of the influence of preoperative hearing threshold. Study Design: Case series and chart review. Subjects and Methods: We classified 141 patients according to preoperative mean air-conduction threshold: 40 to 54 dB, group 1; 55 to 69 dB, group 2; and 70 to 89 dB, group 3. Speech discrimination scores also were noted. Results: All groups showed significant improvement. The greatest increase in postoperative speech discrimination score was seen in group 3. Group 1 improved from moderate hearing loss (mean, 49 dB) to normal (mean, 24 dB); group 2, from moderately severe loss (mean, 61.2 dB) to mild (mean, 28 dB); and group 3, from severe loss (mean, 76.4 dB) to moderate (mean, 41.1 dB). Conclusion: Success in treating otosclerosis does not depend on extent of preoperative hearing loss. Patients with severe loss improved to moderate, increasing the benefit from use of a hearing aid. The patients attained good auditory function, improving their quality of life. © 2009 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.

N2  - Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the economic viability of stapes surgery in Germany. We compared the cost of the operation to the retail value and average cost of a lifelong supply of hearing aids.Study design: Retrospective study.Setting: Tertiary referral centre.Patients: One hundred and sixty-four consecutive cases of primary stapedotomy performed on patients with otosclerosis at our institution served as the representative group for the calculation. The post-operative air-bone gap average at the frequencies 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz was less than 10 dB for 62 per cent of the patients, and less than 20 dB for 92 per cent of the patients. There was a post-operative sensorineural hearing loss in 1.2 per cent of the patients.Results: Analysis showed that, even for an elderly patient aged 65 years with a life expectancy of 15 years, the cost of a lifelong supply of hearing aids was greater than that of a stapedotomy procedure. Based on our group of patients, the stapedotomy procedure proved to be €800000 K cheaper than treatment with an averagely priced hearing aid. The economic benefit was still present when taking into account possible revision surgery in 5-10 per cent of cases, and also when, in addition to the surgery, a post-operative hearing aid was required, in for example 20 per cent of cases.Conclusion: Stapes surgery is economically beneficial for the individual patient as well as for the general patient cohort, irrespective of age. The stapedotomy procedure also prevents the known disadvantages of conventional hearing aids, thus improving the patient's quality of life. © 2008 JLO (1984) Limited.

N2  - Objective: To validate a disease-specific health related quality of life (HRQOL) instrument for children with chronic suppurative otitis media with or without cholesteatoma. Methods: Caregivers of 45 children with chronic suppurative otitis media, who were offered an operation (tympanoplasty or radical mastoidectomy) in a tertiary children's hospital, were administered a 5-item quality of life survey (COM-5) The COM-5, which is a modified version of OM-6, was administered four times: few weeks and few days before operation and six months and one year postoperatively. Psychometric characteristics and more specifically test-retest reliability, internal consistency, construct validity, and responsiveness to clinical change of the COM-5 score were the main outcome measures. Results: Median COM-5 score was 2.6 (1- to 7-point scale) with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life. Test-retest reliability was good (interclass correlation coefficient = 0.73) Construct validity was demonstrated by significant correlations between COM-5 score and global ear-related quality of life (R = -0.485), between physical suffering and ear-related physician visits (R = 0.41) and between caregiver concerns vs ear-related physician visits (R = 0.44). The mean change in COM-5 score after successful tympanoplasty was 1.1 and correlated well with the change of global ear-related quality of life rating (R = -0.545) as well as with the degree of clinical change reported by the caregiver (R = 0.494). The mean standardized response was 1.3 after tympanoplasty indicating the instrument's large responsiveness to clinical change after this procedure, but only 0.7 after radical mastoidectomy. Conclusions: The COM-5 is a valid, reliable and responsive instrument. Apart from its satisfactory psychometric characteristics, it can be easily administered in caregivers of children who require a tympanoplasty due to chronic suppurative otitis media. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - Objective/Hypothesis: This study describes a transcanal antrotomy technique and highlights its advantages for removal of disease in the tympanum and antrum. Study Design: Retrospective review of surgical cases using a transcanal antrotomy approach. Methods: The author's database of major otological procedures was reviewed to identify cases in which a transcanal approach was utilized to remove disease confined to the tympanum-antrum. Cases in which disease progressed into the mastoid, requiring a postauricular approach were excluded. Patient demographics, ear pathology, surgical variables, postoperative variables, and audiometric data were recorded. Standard descriptive statistics were used to summarize demographic and clinical characteristics of study cases. Intraoperative video segments were recorded and edited to depict the operative technique. Results: Transcanal antrotomy was performed on 47 patients (mean age = 38.7, 51% men, 49% women). Ossicular reconstruction was performed in 27 patients during initial surgery. Sculptured, interposed incus was used in 77.8% of cases. Average intraoperative time was 130 minutes (range = 79-166 min). No major complications occurred postoperatively. Follow-up ranged from 26 to 3,680 days (average = 922 days). No patient had recurrent disease in the antrum. Closure of air-bone gap to within 20 dB occurred in 85% of cases. Conclusions: Transcanal antrotomy is a safe, efficacious, and minimally-invasive approach to remove disease from the middle ear and antrum. This approach allows for optimal exposure of the antrum and is less invasive than postauricular and endaural approaches. With transcanal antrotomy, second stage procedures can be avoided in many cases resulting in reduced costs and improved quality of life. © 2008 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - Objectives/Hypothesis: To examine indications for ossiculoplasty (OP) in aural atresia surgery and to compare audiometric results and surgical revision rates between patients undergoing OP and those undergoing intact native chain reconstruction (INCR). Study Design: Retrospective chart review. Methods: Charts of patients undergoing surgery for congenital aural atresia were reviewed for demographic data, preoperative Jahrsdoerfer score, ossicular chain status, and audiometric data. Patients undergoing OP were compared with an equal number of age and Jahrsdoerfer grade-matched patients who had an INCR. The preoperative and postoperative average air-bone gap (ABG), speech reception thresholds (SRT), and rates of revision surgery were compared between the two groups. Results: Nineteen patients (20 ears) underwent OP during aural atresia repair and were compared with 20 matched patients who had INCR. Mean age, Jahrsdoerfer score, preoperative ABG, and SRT were similar for both groups. Mean postoperative audiometric follow-up was 33.1 months for the OP group and 20.4 months for the INC group (P =.24). Mean postoperative ABG was 33.8 dB HL for OP and 23.8 dB HL for INCR (P <.05). Mean improvement in ABG was 16.8 dB HL for OP and 29.9 dB HL for INCR (P <.001). Mean improvement in SRT was 24.6 dB HL for OP and 34.8 dB HL for INCR (P <.05). Nine ears (45%) in the OP group and four ears (20%) in the INCR group underwent revision surgery (P =.09). Conclusions: Patients reconstructed with their own intact native chain during aural atresia surgery have better audiometric outcomes than those undergoing OP and are less likely to undergo revision surgery. © 2008 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.

N2  - Objectives: Our objective was to evaluate the features of tympanosclerosis in children and to determine the effect of stapes mobility and the type of one-stage operation on hearing outcomes. Materials and methods: Fifty-one children who were performed different types of single-stage otologic surgery for tympanosclerosis between January 1997 and December 2006 were retrospectively chart reviewed. The children were divided into two groups according to the mobility of ossicular chain, especially the stapes. Stapes fixed group was also evaluated in detail according to the type of surgery that was performed. Patients who had previous ventilation tube insertion, tympanic membrane parasynthesis or any other otologic surgery were excluded from the study. Improvement of the hearing by at least 10 dB and air-bone gap less than 20 dB were accepted as success criteria after 24 months of follow-up period. Results: The air conduction levels, and the air-bone gap values of both groups were improved significantly after the single-stage operations. Pure tone averages pre- and postoperatively for stapes mobile group were 45.55 ± 15.96 and 34.50 ± 16.64 dB (p = 0.002); and in stapes fixed group these were respectively 43.97 ± 13.45 and 33.16 ± 12.14 dB (p < 0.001). When pre- and postoperative air-bone gap levels were evaluated it was seen that in both groups they were improved more than 10 dB, from 34.10 ± 11.37 to 23.05 ± 12.32 dB (p = 0.002) in stapes mobile group and from 35.29 ± 11.65 to 24.48 ± 12.50 dB (p < 0.001) in stapes fixed group. In stapes fixed group air-bone gap was less than 20 dB in 11 of 23 (47.8%) patients who had mobilization and 3 of 8 (37.5%) patients who had small fenestra stapedotomy operations. Although it was not statistically significant, gain was more than 10 dB only in 2 of 8 (25.0%) patients in the stapedotomy group but 14 of 23 (60.9%) patients in mobilization group (p = 0.698 for ABG and p = 0.220 for gain). The change in the bone conduction levels were improved 0.75 dB in group 1 and got worse 0.52 dB in group 2 and this was not statistically significant (p = 0.239). Conclusions: In this study about children, the status of stapes and the place of tympanosclerotic mass had no significant negative effect on hearing improvement. You can perform mobilization in one-stage if you are experienced and have to prefer second-stage surgery if stapes is fixed and stapedectomy is needed. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

N2  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of smoking on surgical outcome and hearing results in tympanoplasty by serum cotinine analysis as an objective method. Furthermore, type of grafting for the smoking patients has been investigated in a prospective cohort in a tertiary medical center. The overall success rate of long-term surgical outcome was 70.1% out of 77 tympanoplasty operations. On the basis of cotinine enzyme immunoassay, 56 patients had a serum cotinine measurement below 17.5 ng/ml and 21 patients above that. While the graft take rate in the non-smoking group was 76.8%, it was 52.4% in the smoking group and this difference was statistically significant (p = 0.037). While mean graft take rate in the temporalis fascia group was 25% for smokers, mean graft take rate in cartilage shield tympanoplasty group it was 88.9%, and for smokers it was 52.4%. Cotinine is a major metabolite of nicotine and is a reliable marker to differentiate smoking patients from non-smokers. Smoking status was found as a significant prognostic factor influencing the success rate of tympanoplasty negatively and the influence of a more stable grafting technique was demonstrated on smoking patients undergoing tympanoplasty procedure. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

N2  - In line with the rising number of recreational divers, the otorhinolaryngologist has to deal with growing numbers of diving-associated disorders of the ear, nose and throat (ENT). Nevertheless, the majority of divers present to their ENT doctor for assessment of their fitness to dive. On the basis of long-term follow-up examinations and increasing experience in diving medicine, even divers with a history of ENT problems can be considered fit to dive. Therefore, diving is possible after tympanoplasty, surgery to improve hearing including stapesplasty, after implantation of middle ear amplifiers or cochlear implants, after sinus or scull base surgery and even after canal wall down mastoidectomy, provided that certain requirements are fulfilled. Assessing fitness to dive after inner ear barotrauma as well as after inner ear decompression illness requires meticulous consideration of residual damage and possible underlying conditions like vascular right-to-left shunts. This article is based on the new recommendations of the German Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society for the assessment of fitness to dive in the otorhinolaryngological field. © 2008 Springer Medizin Verlag.

N2  - Conclusions. The patients recovered from the surgery as after unilateral surgery. The success rate for hearing improvement was good both subjectively and objectively, and this was also displayed in the quality of life. According to our study, simultaneous bilateral stapes surgery can be performed safely in selected patients with bilateral conductive hearing loss. Objectives. Otosclerosis is bilateral in the majority of patients. In this study we evaluated the outcome of simultaneous bilateral stapes surgery. Subjects and methods. Eighteen patients suffering from bilateral otosclerosis or osteogenesis imperfecta were prospectively included. After operation, hearing and vestibular function were followed by audiometry and visual feedback posturography (VFP). Patients estimated their hearing gain, the intensity of vestibular symptoms and quality of life score with a questionnaire during the follow-up period of 1 year. Results. The mean improvement in pure-tone average (PTA) air conduction (PTA-AC) was 18 dB (range 1-41 dB). The mean air-bone gap (AB-GAP) diminished from 22 dB (range 10-41 dB) to 7 dB on both sides (range 0-18 dB). The mean preoperative score of 2.3 for hearing improved significantly to 4.1 (p<0.001). Vestibular symptoms were mild and temporary. The VFP was not permanently impaired in any of the patients. The quality of life score improved significantly from 3.4 to 1.3 postoperatively (p<0.001). © 2008 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - To compare the safety and efficacy of the transobturator tape (Monarc®) with the retropubic tape (tension-free vaginal tape, TVT®) for the treatment of urodynamic stress incontinence (USI) a prospective, single-blinded, multi-centre randomised clinical controlled trial was undertaken in four urogynaecology units in Australia. One hundred and eighty-seven women with USI were randomly allocated to undergo surgery with either the Monarc sling (n = 80) or TVT (n = 107). Outcome measures were intra-operative complications (especially bladder injury), as well as peri-operative complications, symptomatology, quality of life and urodynamic outcomes. At 3 months, data were available on 140 women, 82 (59%) TVT and 58 (42%) Monarc. The TVT group was significantly more likely to be complicated by bladder injury (7 TVT, 0 Monarc, p < 0.05). Blood loss and operative time were significantly less in the Monarc group, which was 49 mls (31) vs that of the TVT group, which was 64 mls (41) p < 0.05; 18.5 min (6.5) TVT vs 14.6 min (6) Monarc (p < 0.001). The subjective and objective stress incontinence cure rates were 86.6% (71) vs 72.4% (42) p = 0.77 and 79.3 vs 84.5%, p = 0.51 for the TVT and Monarc groups, respectively. Both groups reported similar improvement in incontinence impact and satisfaction with their operation, although return to activity was significantly quicker with the transobturator route (p = 0.029). The transobturator tape appears to be as effective as the retro-pubic tape in the short term, with a reduction in the risk of intra-operative bladder injury, shorter operating time, decreased blood loss, and quicker return to usual activities. © International Urogynecology Journal 2007.

N2  - Conclusion. The classification and hearing result reporting system of middle ear surgery provide a set of standard that otologic surgeons should comply with when they investigate the efficacy of procedures or report the post-operative results of middle ear surgery. Keeping up with this system will, in turn, facilitate and activate the evidence-based clinical research they would ask for. Objectives. The aims of the project were to establish the standardized classification nomenclature, to propose a guideline for the post-operative result reporting system, and to develop a database management program for middle ear surgery. Methods. Nine otologic surgeons from seven university hospitals in Korea carried out a field survey on the nation-wide status of middle ear surgery and its records, and also collected the information regarding international classification and result reporting system from 2001 through 2004. To make a consensus, it also underwent a process of public audit and, a questionnaire investigation, as well. Results. The classification of surgery consisted of four kinds of procedures of mastoidectomy, tympanoplasty, extraneous procedures, and concurrent procedures. Post-operative hearing result reporting consisted of basic requirement and reporting guidelines of hearing success. The basic requirements stated minimum follow up duration, and computing formulae of pure tone average (PTA) and post-operative air bone gap (ABG). The reporting guidelines included criteria of hearing success (Post-operative ABG ≤ 20 dB, hearing gain ≥15 dB, or hearing level ≤30 dB), post-operative ABG grading of excellent, good, no or poor improvement, and comparisons of hearing improvement among the groups. Next, a database management program was developed using the standardized classification and result reporting system. Structure of database is composed of 144 fields including patient information/preoperative findings (45 fields), operative findings (36 fields), operative procedures (29 fields), and post-operative follow up (23 fields). © 2007 Taylor & Francis.

N2  - Nowadays, it is widely accepted that patients must be informed about the risks associated with any type of surgical procedure. Usually, the information provided consists of quoting a list of risks and their probability of occurrence based on data from the literature, and, more appropriately, the figures reflecting the surgeon's personal experience. As a rule, such data are sufficient to hold up in court in the event of a lawsuit, but may be insufficient to help patients make the most appropriate choice. We report two cases that presented complications following stapedotomy. Both cases had a sensorineural hearing loss and a vestibular deficit. This paper aims at describing the important psychological and social consequences of these complications. The potential impact of such complications on the quality of life and the projects for the future of these young patients was predictable. In order to better assist patients in choosing amongst options, we have taken action and modified our approach in advising our patients eligible for stapedotomy procedures. Copyright © 2007 S.

N2  - Objective: To investigate temporal, social, demographic, and health care utilization factors associated with myringotomy with ventilation tube insertion (MVTI) in Western Australian (WA) children. Design: Observational retrospective population-based cohort study using hospital administrative data. Setting: All WA hospitals. Participants: A total of 53 673 children younger than 15 years who underwent surgery for MVTI in the period 1981-2004. Main Outcome Measures: Age-specific incidence rates and incidence rate ratios. Results: The rate of MVTI in children younger than 15 years peaked in 1997 at 6.7 per 1000 person-years and decreased to 5.6 per 1000 person-years by 2004. Based on 2004 rates, 8.4% of WA children will undergo at least 1 MVTI procedure before reaching age 15 years. The rate of MVTI was 37% lower in Indigenous children, and the procedures were performed at an older age compared with non-Indigenous children. Higher rates of MVTI were associated with areas of higher economic resources, lower education and occupation status, and living in metropolitan areas. Conclusions: The rate of MVTI in WA is showing evidence of a decline, even among children younger than 5 years. There remains an issue regarding equity of access to care for Indigenous children. Increasing parental economic resources may be associated with higher rates of MVTI independent of educational status. ©2006 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

N2  - Positive surgical indications for an only hearing ear were evaluated in order to improve patients' quality of life. Fifteen cases of surgery involving an only hearing ear over the past eight years were retrospectively reviewed. Of eight perforated chronic otitis media cases, seven underwent type one tympanoplasty and one underwent simple underlay myringoplasty regardless of otorrhoea at the time of surgery. Of six cholesteatoma cases, two received the canal wall up method and four received the canal wall down method. Ossiculoplasty was carefully performed in six cases. Hearing was improved in seven cases, whereas it remained unchanged in seven cases and deteriorated in one case. Of nine patients, two did not need a hearing aid after surgery. Five patients with severe combined hearing loss (>90 dB) were able to communicate with a hearing aid, alleviating their anxiety regarding hearing loss. Only hearing ears with chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma can be successfully treated by tympanoplasty with or without ossiculoplasty. © 2006 JLO (1984) Limited.

N2  - Objectives: We evaluated the surgical outcome of tympanoplasty for chronic otitis media in post-irradiated patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Methods: Nineteen ears were treated in 15 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma who had undergone radiotherapy in this retrospective clinical series. Only patients with simple perforations of the tympanic membrane and normal or near-normal eustachian tube function were enrolled in this study. All patients underwent type I tympanoplasty. Results: All patients had been treated with radiotherapy of 64.8 to 81.0 Gy. The intervals between radiotherapy and surgery ranged from 17 months to 20 years. The tympanic membranes in 10 of 19 ears were intact after surgery. Otorrhea had subsided in 11 ears (58%), and the incidence of otorrhea was decreased in 6 ears (32%). Thirteen of the 15 patients (86.7%) reported that their quality of life had improved. Conclusions: Surgical intervention benefits some patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma with chronic otitis media resulting from radiotherapy. © 2006 Annals Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objective: In spite of declining prevalence chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma (CSOM) still poses a significant health problem. Randomized clinical trials comparing medical and surgical intervention are not available. Hence, the treatment of CSOM is almost exclusively based on empirical experience. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the long-term effects of mastoidectomy combined with myringotomy and exploration of the middle ear in children with CSOM. Methods: 47 children with CSOM underwent surgery including mastoidectomy. Ear status was investigated peri-operatively and at a long-term follow-up (5-21 years post-operatively). Main outcome measures: Final success rate, FS (dry ears for several years) and the optimal final success rate, OFS (dry ears for several years without re-operations and without retractions/perforations) were estimated. Results: No serious surgical complications occurred. Post-operatively re-mastoidectomy was performed in 13% and re-myringoplasty/tympanoplasty in 21%. At the long-term follow-up the FS rate was 94% and the OFS rate was 61%. Conclusions: Surgery alone did not entirely cure CSOM which may justify randomized studies comparing conservative treatment and myringoplasty with/without mastoidectomy. Finally, mastoidectomy in these patients must be considered as a last resort when intense conservative treatment fails. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

N2  - Objectives: A cross-sectional observational study was designed to evaluate patient satisfaction after stapedotomy. Methods: Two validated questionnaires, the Psychosocial Impact of Assistive Devices Scale (PIADS) and the Hearing Handicap Inventory (HHI), were used to assess patients for whom audiometric data were available. Results: The response rate was 79%. The PIADS score showed that 96% of patients reported an improvement in quality of life. The HHI score, however, showed that 32% of patients still experienced a marked degree of handicap after surgery. The HHI scores correlated positively with postoperative audiometric data, and the PIADS scores correlated positively with the degree of change in audiometric data. Conclusions: The results of this study support the role of small fenestra stapedotomy as a primary treatment for otosclerosis. The study also identifies a certain subpopulation of patients with residual handicap who may require further aural rehabilitation. © 2005 Annals Publishing Company. All rights reserved.

The clinical data and following-up results of 49 patients treated with combined approach of tympanoplasty and mastoidectomy with close technique and 82 patients treated with open mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty were retrospective analyzed. In the group treated with combined approach tympanoplasty, all patients got dry ear in 20 days and 31 patients' hearing level enhanced over 15 dB after the operation; but in the group treated with open mastoidectomy with tympanoplasty, only 13 patients got dry ear in 20 days and no patients' hearing level enhance over 15 dB after the operation. Although the recurrence rates between two groups were not significant difference, the patients of former group not only took a shorter recovery time and got a better hearing recovery, but also kept a normal external auditory meatus, at the same time, they need not to clear scab at fixed period all life long. When performed on carefully selected patients, combined approach tympanoplasty was a feasible surgical method to improve the surgery results and living quality of patients following the operation, however, the advanced equipment and perfect operation skill are necessary.

N2  - Hearing is one of the special senses god has bestowed upon human beings. One can really appreciate the value of hearing only when one ceases to hear. Unfortunately, in our country the hearing impaired individuals are ridiculed, whereas the visually impaired are sympathized upon. Our country being a developing nation with poor socio-economic status and low environmental surroundings, chronic diseases of the ear account for nearly 5% of the population. One will not be surprised if the statistics reveal five crores chronic ear patients in our country. If this ailment is not corrected, the hardship faced by the patients will be tremendous. Hence, the purpose of ear surgery is to restore normal anatomical and physiological status of the ear, so that the patient leads a comfortable lifestyle. ENT surgeons by performing corrective surgery for chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) can change the lifestyles of their patients profoundly. The medical line of management will only lessen the severity of symptoms. With the present modern gadgets coupled with skill acquired by otologist, I will exhort every patient with CSOM to undergo corrective ear surgery as to ensure a healthy and normal life.

N2  - We performed surgery of the middle ear in 157 patients (171 ears) between April 1997 and March 2001. In this study, the clinical features and outcomes of middle ear surgery performed in 11 patients (13 ears) 70 or more years of age were analyzed. The diagnoses in these 11 cases included chronic otitis media (6 ears), otitis media cholesteatoma (6 ears), and otosclerosis (1 ear). The types of surgery were myringoplasty (2 ears); tympanoplasty type I (3 ears), type IIIc (6 ears) and type IVc (1 ear); tympanoplasty without ossiculoplasty (1 ear); and stapes surgery (1 ear). Surgery was successful in improving the hearing in 4 ears. Prevention of discharge was the primary purpose of surgery in 10 ears, and discharge was controlled in 9 ears. There were no complications or adverse events associated with the surgery. Surgery can be selected to improve the QOL of patients even if marked improvement in hearing is not expected.

N2  - Nowadays, it is widely accepted that patients must be informed about the risks associated with any type of surgical procedure. Usually, the information provided consists in quoting a list of risks and their probability of occurrence based on data from the literature, and more appropriately, the numbers reflecting the surgeon's personal experience. As a rule, such data is sufficient to hold up in court in the event of a lawsuit, but may be insufficient to help patients in making their most appropriate choice. We report two cases that presented complications following stapedotomy. Both cases involved a sensorineural hearing loss and a vestibular deficit. This paper aims at describing the important psychological and social consequences of these complications. The potential impact of such complications on the quality of life and the projects for the future of these young patients was predictable. In order to better assist patients in choosing amongst options, we have taken action and modified our approach in advising our patients eligible for stapedotomy procedures.

N2  - Exostoses of the external auditory meatus is a well known condition which infrequently requires surgical correction. However, the stenosis caused by severe exostosis can affect quality of life considerably and may require surgical intervention. Canalplasty, in such a situation, is a valid and effective management option. In our series the commonest indication for surgery was recurrent otitis externa. The detailed surgical technique is described and a retrospective analysis of 65 such procedures is presented. There were only two significant complications, both post-operative stenosis, requiring further corrective surgery. In conclusion, canalplasty for the exostosis of the external auditory meatus is a safe surgical option.

N2  - The management of only hearing ears remains controversial because of the risk of postoperative hearing deterioration. We reviewed 12 cases of hearing ears alone operated on at the Hyogo College of Medicine Department of Otolaryngology from 1999 to 2002. All ears were dry at the final examination. Postoperative hearing results were evaluated based on the guideline of the Japan Otological Society (2000). An air bone gap within 15 dB was found in 9 cases (75%), hearing gain exceeding 15 dB was found in 6 cases (50%), the hearing level was within 30 dB in 4 cases (33.3%), and total successful cases numbered 10 (83.3%). Eight patients wore hearing aids before surgery, and 4 patients (50%) did not need them after the surgery. We suggest that tympanoplasty by skillfull surgeons should be done to obtain a dry ear, to avoid a progressive hearing loss, to preserve or improve hearing, and to improve the quality of life. We also suggest that handling of ossicles should minimized in chronic otitis media and cholesteatoma.

N2  - The aim of the study was to evaluate hearing thresholds in 38 patients with rheumatoid arthritis, divided according to disease activity into active (group A, n = 20) and non-active (group B, n = 18) patients. Pure tone audiometry, tympanometry and complete rheumatological assessment were performed. All patients presented poorer auditory thresholds compared with controls. Patients of group A had both air and bone conduction thresholds poorer than group B (although not statistically significant), and most patients of both groups presented an air-bone (a-b) gap. No significant difference in middle ear pressure was noticed between patients and controls. No correlation between hearing impairment and duration of the disease or patients' age was found. The high prevalence of hearing loss in autoimmune diseases supports the importance of audiometric evaluation in such patients. The auditory recovery through middle ear surgery before cranial nerve involvement could be considered in selected patients. Further investigations are needed for a better knowledge of the middle and inner ear involvement in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

N2  - Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of stapes surgery after 20 years of follow-up and to compare the results between large fenestra versus small fenestra stapedotomy. Study Design: Retrospective clinical study. Setting: Tertiary referral center (university hospital). Patients: One hundred forty-two patients with otosclerosis treated by surgery. Intervention: Eighty patients had a total stapedectomy with House-wire prosthesis and 62 patients a stapedotomy with Teflon-piston prosthesis. Main Outcome Measures: Preoperative, postoperative, and long-term hearing thresholds were compared. Patients filled in a questionnaire about the impact of surgery on the quality of life and postoperative symptoms. Results: The long-term pure tone average improvement did not differ significantly between the techniques compared with the preoperative values. The air-bone gap tended to enlarge as a function of time. The change in the pure tone average was 0.9 dB per year for both techniques. In the questionnaire, some patients reported vertigo, tinnitus, loud noise intolerance, and taste disturbances. Loud noise intolerance seemed to persist in the long term. Surgery had no effect on preoperative tinnitus. Conclusions: There were no statistically significant differences between the techniques regarding hearing results. Over the long term, both techniques are safe and effective in restoring hearing and improving quality of life.

N2  - The bone anchored hearing aid (BAHA) is a bone conduction hearing device secured to the skull by the process of osseointegration using a titanium fixture. The device rehabilitates those with a conductive type or a mixed type of hearing loss. Patients who are not able to wear a conventional hearing aid are the primary beneficiaries. Long term outcome analyses from several pioneering centres have shown good stability of the devices, audiological benefit, reduction of otorrhoea, increased comfort, patient satisfaction and improved quality of life. The device reduces the risks of conventional hearing restoration surgery, is predictable and is suitable for paediatric use. The surgery for BAHA implantation involves a single stage day case procedure under local anaesthetic in adults and a two-stage technique under general anaesthetic in children. The service is best delivered by a well-founded multi-disciplinary team that would also be responsible for long term maintenance and after-care. The device has seen some radical changes in the past decade including miniaturisation (BAHA Compact™) and widened indications. It has been demonstrated that bilateral bone anchored hearing aids produce binaural hearing and hence speech intelligibility and stereophonic perception. Studies to evaluate the benefits of BAHA with single-sided deafness including conductive and sensorineural loss are underway. Future developments include single-mount self-tapping assembly, new dermatome for skin grafting, further miniaturisation and digital-aid technology.

N2  - Background: Acquired cholesteatoma is a complication of chronic otitis media that is usually associated with an intense local inflammatory reaction. Cholesteatoma probably arises from epithelial migration close to an ongoing host inflammatory response attributable to a chronic bacterial infection. Chlamydia pneumoniae is an intracellular microorganism associated with several pathologic conditions originally considered noninflammatory, including asthma, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer disease. To investigate a possible relationship between C. pneumoniae and the development of cholesteatoma, tissue was studied in three different layers by polymerase chain reaction analysis. The results were compared with those relative to other two common middle-ear pathogens, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Methods: Cholesteatoma specimens were collected from 32 patients undergoing middle ear surgery. A series of 5-μm-thick specimens were obtained at three different tissue levels, internal (matrix), intermediate (perimatrix), and external (granulation tissue), and processed by polymerase chain reaction for detection of C. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and M. pneumoniae. Fragmentation and polymerase chain reaction amplification were carried out using two substantially different techniques. Results: C. pneumoniae was detected with either polymerase chain reaction techniques in the internal layers in 16 of the 32 cholesteatomas (50%), associated with a positive finding in the intermediate layer in two cases and in the external layer in one case. Four specimens contained H. influenzae, always in the external layer, whereas none contained M. pneumoniae. Conclusions: The close relationship between cholesteatoma and C. pneumoniae demonstrated by the findings of this study could suggest a direct cause and effect link between the pathogen action and the clinical manifestations. Otherwise, a facilitated colonization by C. pneumoniae and chronic pathology of the ear could both take origin from a peculiar immunologic background of the host.

N2  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Induced arterial hypotension is an effective technique to decrease surgical bleeding. Clonidine is an α2-agonist with central action which was proven to be safe in anesthesia. This study aimed at evaluating the efficacy of intravenous clonidine as the primary drug for induced arterial hypotension. METHODS: Participated in this prospective double-blind study 36 patients of both genders, physical status ASA I and II, who were randomly distributed in three groups of 12 patients receiving the following preanesthetic medication 15 minutes before anesthetic induction: 3 μg.kg-1 clonidine (C3), 5 μg.kg-1 clonidine (C5) or 0.9% saline solution (Control). Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane in a maximum concentration of 2%. BP and HR were recorded before, 1 and 5 minutes after induction and at every 5 minutes of anesthesia. Patients receiving 2% isoflurane for more than 15 minutes and not presenting SBP below 80 mmHg were administered sodium nitroprusside to induce arterial hypotension. RESULTS: Sodium nitroprusside was needed in three C3 group patients (25%), one C5 group patient (8%) and eight control group patients (66%). Total nitroprusside dose to induce arterial hypotension in the control group was higher as compared to groups C3 and C5 (p < 0.01). The incidence of complications was similar among groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous clonidine may lead to induced hypotension during tympanoplasties under balanced anesthesia with isoflurane concentration limited to 2%. In the conditions of this study, clonidine has not affected anesthetic quality and emergence time.

N2  - Objectives: To review short- and longer-term results of type III tympanoplasties as performed by the senior author and to compare these results with those reported in the literature. Method: Retrospective review of 96 type III tympanoplasties, with and without mastoidectomy, performed between April 1996 and August 2000. Results: At a mean of 384 days postoperatively, 57.3/, of patients had an air-bone gap of less than 20 dB. The average postoperative gap is 21.4 dB. Gap closure is best at 2000 Hz, with an average drop of 51% from initial value, compared with 34%, 39%, and 18% at 500, 1000, and 4000 Hz, respectively. Conclusion: Our results are similar to those published previously. We emphasize the improvement at 2000 Hz, which is an important frequency for speech discrimination. It would be interesting to see if it correlates with an improvement in quality of life.

N2  - Introduction: Otospongiosis or otosclerosis is a common degenerative and hereditary disease of the labyrinth capsule and occurs mainly in women aged 20 to 30 years. In recent decades stapedotomy has increasingly become the most used surgical technique to the treatment of otosclerosis. Thus, this study analyzes the results of 59 stapedotomies performed at Paulista Hospital of Otorhinolaryngology during the last 7 years. Study design: Clinical randomized. Materials and Method: Retrospective analysis of 59 patients with otosclerosis who underwent stapedotomy performed by the same surgeon and clinical and audiological follow-up. Results: Hearing improvement proved by audiogram airbone gap closure in 53 patients (90%). The complications that occurred were displaced prosthesis (7%); taste alterations (7%); facial paralysis (3%); vertigo (3%); prosthesis total extrusion (1.5%); tinnitus (1.5%); tympanic membrane perforation (1.5%). Conclusion: Stapedotomy has been seen as good therapeutic choice to the treatment of conductive hearing loss by otosclerosis, considering that it generally has low morbidity and high success rates, providing better quality of life to these patients.

N2  - We report clinical trials for 2-octylcyanoacrylate to assess its effect on skin closure in patients who undergo tympanoplasty with postauricular incision. We used technique to minimize postoperative care of surgical wounds and to improve the quality of life of patients during their hospital course. The advantages of using 2-OCA are as follows : (1) Dressing change, disinfection, and suture removal are not required, relieving patients of discomfort associated with postoperative care and lightening the surgeon's ward workload. Hospital stays may also be considerably shortened. (2) Patients can wash their hair on the first postoperative day because no blood or disinfectant gets in their hair. Disadvantages are follows : (1) The risk of hematoma is higher in the incision site treated with 2-OCA than that closed with sutures because wound drainage is inadequate because the wound is closed. (2) 2-OCA is comparatively expensive.

METHOD: 85 cases of cholesteatoma otitis media were performed open method tympanoplasty with the broken bits of their own mastoid process cortex, homological costal cartilage or U shape periosteum connective tissue valve. And plombage was performed at the same time. The reconstruction of ossicular chain (type 0 tympanoplasty): 10 ears did not undergo reconstruction due to increase ment of bone conduction threshold or were in preparation for the second phase operation; 40 ears underwent type III tympanoplasty; 35 ears underwent type IV tympanoplasty. RESULT: The total improvement rate of hearing was 76%, among which 80% were performed type III tympanoplasty and 71.4% underwent type IV tympanoplasty. After operation, the time waited till dry-ears was 19.8 +/- 65.31 days and the dry-ears rate was 97.6% (83/85). Six months after operation, 89.4% (76/85) had smooth external meatus and fine self-cleaning function and no recurrence was found. CONCLUSION: As to cholesteatoma otitis media that could not be performed closed method tympanoplasty, U shape periosteum connective tissue valve and mastoid process cortex were used. Mastoid cavity plombage with homological costal cartilage could effectively overcome the shortcomings of destruction of physiological structure of external meatus caused by open method tympanoplasty, the self-cleaning function of skins of external meatus was remained and the life quality of patients after operation was increased.

N2  - Objective/Hypothesis: The bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) is a well established mode of treatment and many studies show the audiological benefit, but none has assessed the benefit to the quality of life of patients. This study uses the validated Glasgow Benefit Inventory to quantify the changes in quality of life. Study Design: Retrospective questionnaire study. Methods: Sixty consecutive patients receiving treatment with BAHA were enrolled in the study. The male/female ratio was 1.26 to 1; mean patient age was 45 years. The most common indication was hearing loss secondary to mastoid disease and surgery followed by congenital atresia and chronic discharge from the ear. Results: The response rate was 85%, which is high and adds weight to the results. The general benefit score was +34 (range, +27-+48), which is comparable to middle ear surgery but just below benefit from cochlear implantation. The social benefit was +21 (range, +12-+37) with only +10 (range, +2-+26) for the physical score. This pattern mirrors that reported for other ear interventions. Maximum benefit was noted in patients with congenital atresias followed by discharging mastoid cavities. Conclusion: This study is the first to demonstrate significant quality of life benefit from BAHA surgical intervention as measured by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The goal of our investigation was to facilitate research on clinical negotiation between patients and physicians by developing a reliable and valid classification system for patients' requests in office practice. METHODS: We developed the Taxonomy of Requests by Patients (TORP) using input from researchers, clinicians, and patient focus groups. To assess the system's reliability and validity, we applied TORP to audiotaped encounters between 139 patients and 6 northern California internists. Reliability was assessed with the kappa statistic as a measure of interrater agreement. Face validity was assessed through expert and patient judgment of the coding system. Content validity was examined by monitoring the incidence of unclassifiable requests. Construct validity was evaluated by examining the relationship between patient requests and patient health status; patient request fulfillment and patient satisfaction; and patient requests and physician perceptions of the visit. RESULTS: The 139 patients made 772 requests (619 requests for information and 153 requests for physician action). Average interrater agreement across a sample of 40 cases was 94% (kappa = 0.93; P <.001). Patients with better health status made fewer requests (r = -0.17; P = .048). Having more chronic diseases was associated with more requests for physician action (r = 0.32; P = .0002). Patients with more unfulfilled requests had lower visit satisfaction (r = -0.32; P <.001). More patient requests was also associated with physician reports of longer visit times (P = .016) and increased visit demands (P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides evidence that TORP is a reliable and valid system for capturing and categorizing patients' requests in adult primary care. Further research is needed to confirm the system's validity, expand its applicability, and explore its usefulness as a tool for studying clinical negotiation.

N2  - Objective: To evaluate subjective and objective outcomes of surgical therapy in congenital conductive hearing loss (HL) presenting in adulthood. The impact of hearing restoration on quality of life (QOL) for these patients may differ from those with acquired HL. Study Design: Retrospective review of five patients treated surgically. Methods: Standard audiometry was completed. Patients completed a subjective questionnaire as well as subjective (open- set) questions. A seven-point Likert scale was used for closed-set responses with 1 representing the worst possible outcome and 7 being best. Results: The average four-frequency improvements in pure-tone average and air-bone gap were 18 dB (range, 7-29 dB) and 16 dB (range, 2-30 dB), respectively. An average score was obtained for each closed-set question. The highest-scoring items were for overall improvement of QOL (average score, 6), followed by perceived improvement in hearing (average score, 5.6). Other positive responses were improved ability to use the telephone (four of five patients) and improved localization of sound (four of five patients). Negative subjective responses included prolonged dysequilibrium in two of five, prolonged adjustment period in three, and dysgeusia in one patient. Conclusion: Important components of outcome are likely to escape our review if only objective measures are used to evaluate surgical outcomes. These results suggest that improved hearing in this population provides specific improvements in lifestyle and is perceived as a significant improvement in overall QOL.

N2  - Open-cavity tympanomastoidectomies offer a low rate of recurrence or persistence of cholesteatoma. Reoperation for cholesteatoma occurs in 5% or less of patients. This compares quite favorably to the 20% to 40% recurrence rates associated with closed-cavity techniques. Protracted postoperative drainage is uncommon in well-crafted cavities. Individuals are able to engage in almost all of the activities of daily living without difficulty. Little difference exists in the hearing outcome between open-cavity and closed- cavity techniques. This is now generally recognized and widely accepted. Meaningful differences between open-cavity and closed-cavity techniques are recapitulated in Table 1.

N2  - Fifty nine tympanoplasties in children under 15 years of age were reviewed. Staged tympanoplasty or revision surgery was performed in 31 ears with cholesteatoma. The results of surgeries were satisfactory. The ears with preoperative discharge became dry postoperatively in 95 % of the ears, and intact grafts were achieved in 96 % of the ears, and improvement of hearing in 86 % of the ears. The total incidence of residual or recurrent cholesteatomas at the 2nd stake or revision was 32 %, with no significant difference in incidence between the open and closed methods. These findings suggest that surgery can be performed at any age not only for cholesteatoma but also for chronic otitis media, anti that closed tympanoplasty is preferable when possible since it improves patients' quality of life.

N2  - The Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) is a measure of patient benefit developed especially for otorhinolaryngological (ORL) interventions. Patient benefit is the change in health status resulting from health care intervention. The GBI was developed to be patient-oriented, to be maximally sensitive to ORL interventions, and to provide a common metric to compare benefit across different interventions. The GBI is an 18-item, postintervention questionnaire intended to be given to patients to fill in at home or in the outpatient clinic. In the first part of the paper, five different ORL interventions were retrospectively studied: middle ear surgery to improve hearing, provision of a cochlear implant, middle ear surgery to eradicate ear activity, rhinoplasty, and tonsillectomy. A criterion that was specific to the intervention was selected for each study, so that the patient outcome could be classified as above and below criterion. In all five interventions, the GBI was found to discriminate between above- and below- criterion outcomes. The second part of the paper reports on the results and implications of a factor analysis of patient responses. The factor structure was robust across the study, and so led to the construction of subscales. These subscales yield a profile score that provides information on the different types of patient benefit resulting from ORL interventions. The GBI is sensitive to the different ORL interventions, yet is sufficiently general to enable comparison between each pair of interventions. It provides a profile score, which enables further breakdown of results. As it provides a patient-oriented common metric, it is anticipated that the GBI will assist audit, research, and health policy planning.

N2  - In order to identify factors that could influence the success of tympanoplasties in adults, a retrospective study of 291 tympanoplasties performed on patients aged 15 years and older during the years 1984-1989 was carried out. Surgical success was defined as an intact membrane after two years follow-up and hearing improvement of at least 15 decibels. The success rate of the tympanoplasties was 90%. A functioning eustachian tube was found to be important for graft take. No difference was found in the rate of graft take regardless of whether fascia of the temporal muscle or tragal perichondrium was used or if fibrin glue was used. An audiological improvement was seen in 77% of the patients, and no significant difference regarding hearing gain was found between the different prostheses. It is concluded that tympanoplasty in adults is a simple operation with a high probability of success which can improve the quality of life of those operated upon.

N2  - One hundred sixty-two otosclerotic patients who underwent a stapedotomy between October 1991 and April 1994 were examined after experiencing postoperative vertigo. Twenty-eight complained of dizziness. In sixteen patients, we observed vertigo and nystagmus only within the first six postoperative days; in these cases, special treatment was not necessary. However, in twelve patients in whom vertigo persisted even after their stay in the hospital, the problem seriously affected their quality of life and their return to work. In these cases, an individualized diagnostic and therapeutic procedure was indicated. Case reports demonstrate the usefulness of several diagnostic methods (analysis of the case history, audiogram, investigation of the vestibular system, and elimination of non-vestibular causes of vertigo. But only high-resolution computed tomography scans of the temporal bone showed definite results. Air bubbles at the end of the prothesis as indirect sign of perilymphatic fistula, bad position of the piston, new centers of otosclerosis, cicatrices, and in one case fracture of the prothesis. Ten of the twelve patients required revision surgery. In most patients with persisting Vertigo following stapedotomy, revision surgery was justified. However, high-resolution computed tomography is recommended.

N2  - Although a high incidence of postoperative sensorineural loss follows operations for chronic otitis media, this increase could be reduced in the following ways: One should always ask the question: Is this operation really necessary? Obviously in cholesteatomatous ears it nearly always is, but there are exceptions especially among the elderly for whom regular suction toilet with the microscope often provides a safer alternative. Again as long as the incidence of sensorineural loss following attempts to reconstruct the ossicular chain in tympanosclerosis remains as high as at present, the virtue of prescribing a hearing aid as an alternative to surgical treatment should always be considered carefully. When operating to improve function, it should always be established with certainty that there is enough cochlear reserve to ensure that 'technical success' will bring the hearing level to within socially adequate limits, or at least that it will bring the hearing in the operated ear sufficiently close to that of the other ear to provide the 'balance' that is necessary for useful improvement in auditory function. The type of operation must be selected to suit the type of disease and not vice versa. When it is essential that no risk of hearing loss be incurred by the operation, an open technique with obliteration of the mastoidectomy cavity with a soft tissue plug is the only justifiable technique. In such an ear, because of the threat of all tympanoplasty techniques to the cochlea, there must be no attempt whatever to reconstruct either the ossicular chain or the tympanic membrane. The management of labyrinthine fistula due to cholesteatoma demands special consideration, and it is proposed that when the fistula is found by visual inspection and palpation of the matrix to be limited to the lateral semicircular canal, a two stage intact canal wall tympanoplasty will be the method of choice. While we await further evidence to the contrary, if the fistula is more extensive, it seems best to perform a modified radical mastoidectomy, leaving the cholesteatoma overlying the fistula utterly undisturbed. When cholesteatomatous fistula occurs in the only hearing ear, it is especially important and absolutely essential that no attempts be made to reconstruct the ossicular chain or to reconstruct the tympanic membrane. All who practice otologic surgery should continuously develop and review their knowledge and dexterity in the full realization that the successful management of chronic middle ear disease requires maximal awareness of many complex processes and the assumption of a very considerable responsibility to preserve and maintain the priceless sense of hearing without which our patients' quality of life is grievously impaired.
